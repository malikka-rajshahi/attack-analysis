{"text":"Cluster comprises IBM's Opteron-based eServer 325 server and systems management software and storage devices that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nIBM on Tuesday announced a prepackaged and pretested cluster that is powered by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.s 64-bit Opteron processor.\nIBM, of Armonk, N.Y., is combining its Opteron-based eServer 325 server—which targets scientific and technical computing users—with systems management software and storage devices to offer a bundled package that can run Linux and Windows operating systems.\nThe new offering, which will be available later this month or in early December, is part of IBMs eServer Cluster 1350, which also includes bundles based on the companys BladeCenter blade servers and two-processor x335 and x345 systems using Intel Corp.s 32-bit Xeon chips.\nClusters comprise multiple servers tied together to create a supercomputing environment for users. In a related move, IBM last week announced that it was teaming with Corning Inc., the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop high-speed, optically switched interconnects for supercomputers. The $20 million, two-and-a-half-year project is aimed at increasing network bandwidth by 50 times while at the same time cutting the costs of supercomputers.\nIBMs 325 systems, powered by 2GHz Opterons, give users a chance to run both their 32-bit and 64-bit applications on a single platform, which is important for mixed-use environments, said David Turek, vice president of IBMs Deep Computing unit.\n\"For many of these users, who have been left with a stark choice—you either run 32-bit or 64-bit—Opteron is an interesting bridge between the two,\" Turek said. \"Its an attractive proposition.\"\nAMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has pushed Opterons ability to run 32-bit applications as well as it does 64-bit applications as a key differentiator between it and Intels Itanium architecture. The 64-bit Itanium chip maintains a limited amount of backward compatibility, which means that it does not run the 32-bit applications as well as it does the 64-bit software.\nWith the latest Itanium 2 released this summer, officials with Intel, of Santa Clara, Calif., were promoting the companys IA-32 Execution Layer, designed to bridge that performance gap. Intel, which has pushed Xeon-based systems for 32-bit applications and Itanium for 64-bit computing, views the execution layer as a way of helping customers who want to move to 64-bit computing but still have older 32-bit applications running.\nOn Monday, Intel officials said that a software update from Microsoft Corp. that includes the execution layer for Windows applications has been delayed until the second half of next year. However, they said that Linux vendors, including Red Hat Inc. and SuSE Linux AG, both are incorporating the execution layer code in their offerings.\n/zimages/3/28571.gifRead \"MS Delay Hinders Itanium Software Upgrade.\"\nGordon Haff, an analyst with Illuminata Inc., said Opterons adoption path is mirroring that of the older Itanium technology.\n\"Theres a lot of interest in Opteron in [the high-performance computing space]; its nearly exclusively in HPC,\" said Haff, in Nashua, N.H. \"Its a good performing chip, and thats pretty much what HPC [customers are] looking for.\"\nWhile backward compatibility with 32-bit applications may make Opteron more attractive in the commercial space, HPC users are more interested in performance, he said.\nTurek agreed. \"The Intel name carries a lot of weight in the industry,\" he said. That said, HPC and technical computing customers tend to be among the early adopters of new technology.\n\"Theyre searching for the best technology without so much regard for the brand,\" he said.\nThe Opteron cluster offering includes IBM Cluster Management Software, which aims to avoid problems and speed up the resolution of problems that do occur by automating repetitive tasks and error detection.\nAlso included in the cluster package is a new Linux Cluster Install Tool, which automates much of the installation work, IBM officials said.\nIn the supercomputing interconnect project, Cornings Science & Technology Division, in Corning, N.Y., will create a prototype for an optically switched interconnect. IBM Research Labs in the United States and Switzerland will build the systems electronic control and monitoring circuitry.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T18:35:24Z","url":"https://www.eweek.com/networking/ibm-takes-wraps-off-opteron-based-cluster"}

{"text":"Marketers are employed in the public sector as well as the private sector.\nMost people think of marketing as a strictly private sector activity, but the reality is people with sales and marketing backgrounds are hired by government agencies in a number of capacities. Government agencies at the local, state and federal level all employ marketing professionals in areas including, but not limited to, public relations, property disposal, bond sales and purchasing.\nAlmost all major government agencies have their own public-relations staff, and in many cases it is a stand-alone department with a public relations or media director and several support staff. Government agency PR departments are responsible for producing news releases, holding press conferences, and generally promoting activities of the agency, such as tourism or encouraging new businesses to move into the area.\nGovernment agencies are constantly buying supplies, equipment and other property and selling off old equipment and property. The departments tasked with disposing of this government property often hire individuals with a background in marketing. Their job is to assist the agency in coming up with creative ways to sell or otherwise dispose of obsolete government property.\nMost government agencies have to follow complicated regulations for purchasing supplies and equipment. In many cases, agencies can only buy from certain suppliers or can only buy goods within specific price ranges. Agencies often hire purchasing agents with marketing backgrounds to help them manage their purchases, including setting criteria for suppliers and establishing price ranges. Government purchasing agents must be very familiar with current purchasing regulations at their agency.\nLocal, state and federal agencies sometimes sell bonds to finance capital improvement projects in their jurisdictions. These agencies hire bond and securities marketing specialists to prepare bond prospectuses for investors, which detail the terms of the bond, and to organize marketing campaigns to sell the bonds. Bond marketing specialists also typically manage media relations for bond campaigns.\nBrowne, Clayton. \"Are There Marketing Jobs in the Government?\" Work - Chron.com, http://work.chron.com/there-marketing-jobs-government-22921.html.

{"text":"An eagerly awaited report from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that processed meats such as bacon and sausages cause cancer, and red meat likely does so too.\nThe France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the WHO, put processed meats on the top of their “things that cause cancer list”, grouping them alongside tobacco, asbestos and diesel fumes, for which there is “sufficient evidence” of cancer links.\nAlong the years, there have been many studies that linked processed and red meats with cancer (especially bowel cancer), but there were always some doubts floating about. Now, the 22-member panel analyzed animal experiments, studies of human diet and health, and cell mechanisms that could lead from these meats to cancer.\n“These findings further support current public health recommendations to limit intake of meat,” Dr. Christopher Wild, who directs IARC, said in a statement.\nThe decision wasn’t unanimous though, and a “probably” still crept in to the report. Many studies show the links, both in populations of people and in tests that show how eating these foods can cause cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) said in its report, released in the Lancet medical journal.\nThis could give you cancer. Photo by Niklas Rhose.\nMost reports on the links between meat and cancer have been softened with some element of doubt, but the IARC uses clear and direct language in saying processed meat causes cancer. There are no phrases such as “may cause” in the report.\n“Overall, the Working Group classified consumption of processed meat as ‘carcinogenic to humans’ on the basis of sufficient evidence for colorectal cancer,” the report reads. “Additionally, a positive association with the consumption of processed meat was found for stomach cancer. The Working Group classified consumption of red meat as ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’,” it added.\n“The experts concluded that each 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent,” the IARC said. “For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,” said IARC’s Dr. Kurt Straif.\n“Red meat refers to unprocessed mammalian muscle meat—for example, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, or goat meat—including minced or frozen meat; it is usually consumed cooked,” the IARC said in its report.\nRed meat was included in a lower category, which means that while there is evidence for it causing cancer, there is still quite a lot of room for debate. But while processed meat seems to be decidedly bad for your health, not everybody is convinced about red meat.\nThe $95 billion U.S. beef industry has been preparing a retaliation for months, and they’ve been rallying numerous scientists to their cause – even some unafililiated with the meat industry.\n“We simply don’t think the evidence support any causal link between any red meat and any type of cancer,” said Shalene McNeill, executive director of human nutrition at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.\nFor now, the takeaway seems to be this: you need to stop eating processed meat. They have a number of damaging effects, including elevating stroke risk, raising cholesterol and, of course – cancer. If you absolutely can’t give it up, then reduce it. Quantity does matter, and less is, while not ideal, better than more. The same goes for red meat – if you must have it, don’t have it every day. It’s not sustainable, it’s bad for the animals, and it’s bad for you.\nWe’re getting to a point where science is starting to understand what’s good for us and what’s not. Let’s make the science count, shall we?","timestamp":"2019-04-22T19:02:03Z","url":"https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/processed-meat-red-cancer-26102015/"}

{"text":"Was it a surprise to you that you were given the arts and culture position?\nNo, there is no surprise when you are a cadre of the ANC because you are deployed anywhere. You are given a five-year contract to do a portfolio and when you are finished, you wait for another one. At no stage do you have a say.\nWhat qualities do you bring to the position?\nPeople say to me you are a minister here but you can’t sing; how can you survive in the sector? It’s not about that.\nIf you attend some of the meetings of the ANC, you will see that I lead revolutionary songs. I know I can command a revolutionary song.\nI will be working with stakeholders and cultural activists and we will be going on a journey together. We will bring our understanding and our connection with young people.\nThis is an area that is, by and large, filled with practitioners who are young, with hopes for the future and dreams.\nWhat would be important would be to bring that strategic leadership to the sector, primarily to co-ordinate the endeavours that have been started by my predecessors.\nWhat are the first things you will tackle?\nOn my first day I had a briefing on what has happened in the department and what we need to do. I immediately raised the issue that we are writing the true history of South Africa through the voices of its people, rather than through colonialists.\nWe need a single national monument where everybody who comes to South Africa will be able to understand our history. It has to be brand- new. No nation has come through what we have come through without that kind of recognition and national monument.\nSouth Africa has a very rich history that needs to be taught properly. Things such as the Anglo-Boer War need to be taught fully, so that we would see that it was a South African war where everyone had a role. There is this strong feeling I have that it is important that we acknowledge all our history.\nOne thing we have to do is measure the contribution of arts to the big picture. Take for instance the yearly jazz festival in Cape Town. When people go there they talk about one aspect, which is tourism, but they forget that at the core it is arts and culture. They go there to connect spiritually with their needs. It is very important. I also want more people coming here to produce movies.\nI see arts as helping a young democracy that is competing with old democracies. We are still finding our way. I want to see South Africans being given an opportunity to reflect on themselves on a yearly basis. Heritage is very important because this is where we are grooming our people to understand [our cultural history]. By identifying young people and giving them a chance to study, we are creating a reservoir for the future.\nWe must also find a way of promoting all our languages. Some of them are seen as being inferior, which is a mistake. We also have to develop our unofficial languages, such as that of the amaPondo. When we develop them we are saying: ‘We understand your culture, we know who you are and we want to see you prospering.’ It is a huge task.\nWho do you listen to?\nI do not have a favourite because my point of view is that of an internationalist, where I listen to music from around Africa – Senegalese and Congolese music – and the world. I particularly enjoy jazz and soul. When I sit down to reflect and take stock I listen to jazz, and on a really bad day it is soul music. I like Richard Nwamba’s African Connection [programme on SAfm]because it brings that music from across the continent. It’s a pity that it is only once a week; I would like to have it during the week too.\nWe need to take better care of our artists. They entertain us and they become our celebrities, but in the end they die in very difficult circumstances. We need to improve their lives. They helped us to attain freedom and they are creating a new South Africa. Look at kwaito, which was an initiative of young people without anyone guiding them.\nDo the arts get enough financial support?\nI still have to see the fullness of the sector, but I would probably want arts to have more concentration in the sector. I am not sure it would only be financial. If you go to other countries, arts and culture are the things that unite people. They play a big role, like with sports and recreation.\nI am excited because of the potential that I feel we can unearth here. This is a junior department to others, but what can be more senior than leading a nation to identify itself? A nation that does not understand its soul is not worthy to be called a nation.\nAre there limits to freedom of expression? What about The Spear painting?\nOne area that we really fought for very hard is what is contained in the Bill of Rights: people have to express themselves. When you do that, you would be responsible and not express yourself to incite violence. When it comes to The Spear I can’t say it is up to the minister to say what people must express. Whatever we do as a nascent demo-cracy, we must respect others.\nI’m taking my point of view from the values of ubuntu, with the caring and sharing of Africans.\nBut other people have their own views.\nAre you going to any shows this weekend?\nI am going to the office as we speak for consultations, and I will still be doing that this weekend. Obviously I will be going to any events that I can, because you can’t be something that you do not understand fully. It is one of the perks.\nWe have become a crass, materialistic society to the detriment of our most important needs – our spirits and our emotions. We cannot continue that way, because we are missing that sense of belonging.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T11:57:36Z","url":"https://mg.co.za/article/2014-05-29-nathi-mthethwa-on-patrol-for-the-nations-artistic-soul"}
{"text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Sunday warned Congress against manufacturing a crisis over federal spending in the months ahead, as looming deadlines set the stage for a repeat of the political deadlock which two years ago triggered worldwide financial market turmoil.\nIn coming negotiations with Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, Democratic President Barack Obama will focus on ways to create economic gains for the middle class over spending cuts, Lew said.\n“We have already done a lot of deficit reduction,” he said in an interview on NBC. Lew spoke on four TV talk shows, setting out Obama’s priorities ahead of an expected showdown this fall.\nBy early November, Congress must raise the legal limit on the country’s borrowing authority or risk an unprecedented default on the government’s debt.\nA debt ceiling showdown in August 2011 between Obama and congressional Republicans sparked wild stock market swings and cost the United States its top-tier AAA credit rating.\n“We need to get the debt limit extended in a way that doesn’t create a crisis,” Lew said.\nRepublicans see the debt ceiling as the their best leverage in winning a deal with Obama that would cut federal government spending to lower the deficit.\nLew, who was Obama’s budget director in 2011, reiterated the president’s stance that he would not consider short-term spending cuts, nor would he offset defense spending cuts with reductions in other government programs.\n“The president has made crystal clear, he’s not going to negotiate over the debt limit,” Lew said in an interview on ABC.\nThe debt ceiling is one of two fiscal deadlines facing Obama and Congress. By October 1, they must agree on a stop-gap measure to keep the government funded or face a shutdown.\nRepublicans have eyed this budget deadline as a way to roll back steep spending cuts for defense programs. But that is not an option, Lew said.\nCongress is scheduled to leave town August 2 for a five-week recess.\nAsked about the possibility of a federal response to Detroit’s recent bankruptcy declaration, Lew threw cold water on any chances the struggling city will get federal aid.\n“Detroit is going to have to work with its creditors on this,” Lew told ABC.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T00:53:02Z","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-lew/lew-says-stubborn-congress-risks-repeating-u-s-fiscal-wounds-idUSBRE96R06520130728?feedType=RSS"}

{"text":"In case you missed it, the initials ICYMI stand for the first five words of this sentence. In the event you have, indeed, missed it (ITEYH, I, MI has not taken off yet for some reason), it’s most likely because you’re not on the Internet much, particularly Twitter, where individuals and outlets deploy it every few seconds to bring links to the attention of others who may not have seen them. The New York Times now even has a section at the bottom of its app called “In Case You Missed It” with articles from previous days.\nWhile the extended phrase has been used in conversation for a long time, the shorthand betrays an anxiety central to the Internet epoch. There is simply too much readable, viewable and listenable data for anyone to stay abreast of, as a humor piece, “I’m All Caught Up!” by Nick Mickowski in McSweeney’s, playfully suggested.\nWe used to receive media cyclically. Newspapers were published once (or sometimes twice) a day, magazines weekly or monthly. Nightly news was broadcast, well, each night. Television programs were broadcast on one of the major networks one night a week at a specific time, never to return until a rerun or syndication. Movies were shown first in theaters and on video much later (or, before the advent of VCRs, not until a revival). There were not many interstices, just discrete units — and a smaller number of them.\nNow we’re in the midst of the streaming era, when the news industry distributes material on a 24-hour cycle, entire seasons of TV shows are dumped on viewers instantaneously, most movies are available at any time and the flow of the Internet and social media is ceaseless. We are nearly all interstitial space, with comparatively few singularities.\nThe cumulative effect is overwhelming for both producers of content and its consumers. Those who put out work, understandably, want to make sure it’s not lost on whatever site is hosting it, let alone in the social media blizzard of “must read” links, one-off jokes and other self-promotion. When the home page of a website refreshes every couple of hours (or minutes), there aren’t a lot of conspicuous ways to showcase older material except through the referrals of Twitter, Facebook and the like.\nPre-Internet, we accepted that media had a mayfly’s life span: Yesterday’s news was yesterday’s news, and that was it. If you were the creator of it, you made peace with the notion that people either saw it or didn’t when it appeared, and you moved on; there was no alternative.\nIf it lingered in the public consciousness, it was because of its durability, not repeated reminders. Content had finite endings and deaths, not asymptotic approaches and long-term vegetative states from which resuscitation is always an option.\nNow, with just about every airing of a much greater number of shows obtainable at any moment, there is no excuse for missing one — and, therefore, a more urgent compulsion to catch up, in case you missed it.\nToday, both the outlets and the individuals who are responsible for the work are aware that they have a limited window in which their content can go viral and outlive its short stay on a home page. When it fails to do so, as, by definition, almost everything must, it may seem to them like a disheartening screen-age Zen koan: If an article about deforestation is published but no one clicks on it, did it actually exist?\nHence ICYMI. In an earlier time, the full verbal formulation meant that the recipient was supposed to see something of a certain degree of importance (a note, an email), and the sender was gently reminding you of its oversight.\nNow, the very shortening of the phrase is a byproduct and acknowledgment of the velocity of information against which its attached link is racing. The implication is that you probably have not seen it, and it’s not necessary to your existence, but the sender would like to bring it to your attention anyway, please. It serves as a call of desperation as much as an announcement: Can you hear my whisper in these howling winds? In fact, ICYMI is often used as the second or third attempt to link to something (which suggests the content is not taking off organically) as a means of excusing the repetitive promotion.\nEven the Twitter account for President Obama, one of the few people who can assume that his actions are never missed by the world, occasionally uses ICYMI, especially to highlight achievements the White House may think are undervalued by the public, such as job growth and the Affordable Care Act.\nElissa Strauss, a columnist for TheWeek.com and a freelancer for a number of other Web publications, said that a financial incentive also drives Internet content creators who post their work multiple times (she said she typically “triple tweets” each of her articles).\nGiven the near-infinite accessibility of digital media, it suggests that what Walter Benjamin called the unique, mystical “aura” of an object of art in his seminal 1936 essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” greatly diminished by the reproductive technologies of his time, is completely eradicated by ours.\nLive performances may be the last place to locate any sense of aura. Mr. Benjamin saw various reasons for optimism in the diminution of the aura. Reproduction, he posited, could emancipate us from cultlike reverence toward art and make us keener, more politicized critics. But nowadays it’s passé to note that, during live events, people are often staring into their reproduction-friendly phones, perhaps a redirected form of ritual obeisance.\nAt least they can probably find a video or photo (maybe one they shot themselves) of what they were at later, in case they missed it.\nComing Soon: Sign up to receive our NYT Living newsletter, a weekly roundup lifestyle news from the Style, Travel, Food and Home sections delivered to your inbox.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T16:14:41Z","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/style/the-unending-anxiety-of-an-icymi-world.html?_r=0"}

{"text":"NEW YORK — Television retailer QVC has made aggressive plans to keep shoppers watching — instead of mall-hopping — on Black Friday, an event it has traditionally ignored.\nThe leading network for TV shoppers promises special deals and a healthy dose of new items for sale starting on Thanksgiving night. Program host Dave James plans to stay awake for 28 hours of telethon-like coverage.\nThe day after Thanksgiving is traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year, called “Black Friday” because it’s key for many businesses to go in the black, or turn a profit. QVC, which competes with ShopNBC and the HSN home shopping network, has not wanted to get caught up in the frenzy and has always treated it as just another day for its sales pitches, said Doug Rose, the network’s vice president of programming and marketing.\n“This year, and we’ve been planning on this for many months, we really expect to join the fray with the other retailers,” Rose said.\nQVC is hoping for a “Black Friday” of its own. Hurt by the same recession that affected other retailers last year, QVC’s fourth quarter revenue in 2008 was down 8 percent from the previous year. So far this year revenue has been essentially flat, although the value of the items that QVC is selling is down slightly.\nThe network generally offers one “special value” item to customers each day. For “Black Friday” coverage, which starts at 8 p.m. EST on Thanksgiving, there will be three.\nEvery hour, there will be a specially priced offer, and there will be five hours of gifts that have never been available before on the network, QVC said.\nRival HSN, which has also been flat in sales this year, mailed one million gift guides for the first time to people who have bought things through the network in the past. It is also offering specially-priced items over the Thanksgiving weekend, although that’s not a shift from what it has done in the past.\nHSN also had a “Get Ready for the Holidays” programming theme for the first week of November, for people who wanted advice on cooking and decorating. HSN has a little more than half QVC’s sales domestically.\nJames, a former radio disc jockey, said the closest thing he’s come to his upcoming 28-hour marathon is hosting radiothons for about half the time.

UCC had only ten successful applicants for their Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Chemistry program. To get more students, a special entry process was initiated. She applied, passed the exams and gained admission.\nBut for UCC’s inability to meet their required number of intake, an educational system that recognises only students who come out with flying colours in exams would have deprived Ghana and the world such a gem.\nWith this story and painful experience, she lived everyday longing for the opportunity to be part of an educational system with no barriers and one that is patient enough to bring the worse of student to the level of academic excellence their potentials and desire can get them to.\nThis is the story and vision that gave birth to Ghana’s first and West Africa’s second Open University- Laweh Open University.\nThe University was established in the year 2014 as an open supported learning institution to offer certificates, diplomas, degrees and postgraduate Programmes. LAWEH is a global partner of Franklin University and Open University of Tanzania.\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the school’s 11 Member Governing Council, Prof Goski Alabi who is a member of the Counsel indicated that education should be the right of every individual and failure to pass exams at one stage should in no way be the end of the road for people who desire to move further.\nAccording to her, all over the world, the Open University System has been adopted as the way to removing the barriers to education, give people the freedom to learn at their own pace and convenience and come up better equipped to compete in this competitive world.\nShe indicated that the days of writing remedial exams over and over are over.

{"text":"Occasional diarrhea is a common occurrence. Most people will experience an episode of diarrhea at least once or twice a year that will disappear in a couple of days.\nLuckily, there are many foods to eat that may help a person reduce the symptoms of diarrhea. There are also some foods to avoid when dealing with a bout of diarrhea, and some additional home care tips to consider.\nAnyone who is experiencing persistent diarrhea should see a doctor, as a person may become dehydrated over time.\nDiarrhea is a bowel movement that is more liquid than solid or has a loose texture. It is a common problem and may occur a couple of times each year. Diarrhea will usually last no more than 3 days.\nSoft, bland foods, such as toast, will help to absorb excess water and ease the symptoms of diarrhea.\nPeople with chronic digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn's disease, may experience diarrhea more regularly.\nA person's diet is crucial if they are experiencing diarrhea. Some foods might help relieve symptoms of diarrhea while eating other foods can make diarrhea worse.\nWhile recovering from diarrhea, a person should eat bland, simple foods that are easy to digest and will help absorb some water from the stool.\nThese foods may be especially helpful on the first day of dealing with diarrhea. Eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep the digestive system from becoming overworked.\nProbiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, may help in some cases, but in others, probiotics may irritate the digestive system even more.\nProbiotics aid digestion by improving the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. However, dairy products can irritate the digestive system, so a person may wish to try non-dairy sources of probiotics, such as miso or sauerkraut.\nLiquids are also vital to recovery. People with diarrhea must drink plenty of water throughout the day and should drink an additional cup of water after every loose bowel movement.\nDrinking plenty of water helps prevent dehydration and flush any toxins out of the body.\nSoup broth will help to replace minerals and electrolytes lost because of diarrhea.\nSpicy ingredients can act as irritants in the digestive system. This is why people dealing with diarrhea should stick to bland foods, as they pose the least risk of agitating the digestive system.\nIt is not advisable to eat foods high in fat or oil when recovering from diarrhea. Added fats and oils from frying can be difficult for the sensitive digestive system to process and will likely make symptoms worse.\nA person can try eating boiled or steam vegetables and lean proteins instead.\nSugars that pass into the colon may disrupt the already sensitive bacteria there, making diarrhea worse. This includes fruit juices and high-sugar fruits.\nPeople with diarrhea should also avoid artificial sweeteners, as some can have a laxative effect.\nIt may also help to avoid too much fiber. Fiber helps keep the digestive system active. Usually, this is a good thing, but when the body is trying to recover from diarrhea, fiber may make symptoms worse.\nSoluble fibers, such as the pectin found in apples and bananas, can actually help a person recover from diarrhea, but a person should still try to limit their intake at least for the first day of symptoms.\nMany people experience diarrhea after drinking alcohol. Furthermore, some types of alcohol can be more likely to cause diarrhea than others. Learn more.\nCarbonated or fizzy drinks should be avoided, as they can irritate the digestive system and make the symptoms of diarrhea worse.\nCaffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda, may overstimulate the digestive system and make symptoms worse.\nCarbonated drinks may also irritate or contribute to other symptoms, such as bloating and cramps. People should also avoid alcohol while dealing with diarrhea.\nWhile many sports drinks contain electrolytes that may help with dehydration, they often contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Coconut water or electrolyte-enhanced water are good alternatives.\nIn addition to following a diet that will help relieve diarrhea, there are several other remedies a person can take to make a swift recovery.\nOther diarrhea treatments include bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) and Ioperamide (Imodium). These drugs can help relieve occasional cases of diarrhea and may be helpful to have on hand in a medicine cupboard.\nPepto Bismol and Imodium are available for purchase over-the-counter or online.\nPeople with diarrhea should also ensure they get enough rest, as putting the body in stressful situations while dealing with diarrhea may make matters worse.\nLimit physical activity while diarrhea symptoms are presenting, as strenuous activity may put the body at a greater risk of dehydration.\nHydration is also vital when managing diarrhea. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\nClick here to learn more about treating diarrhea.\nBlood or mucus may appear in the stool in more serious cases of diarrhea. This is often accompanied by a fever and requires a visit to the doctor as soon as possible.\nUntreated diarrhea can also lead to serious complications, including dehydration. A person with severe diarrhea may require hospitalization and intravenous electrolytes.\nAnyone experiencing a fever of higher than 102°F or severe abdominal pains should visit a doctor.\nParents or guardians should carefully monitor any children with diarrhea. If symptoms do not clear up with 24 hours, they should call the doctor for guidance.\nAny additional symptoms should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment.\nMany cases of diarrhea last only a few days and respond well to home treatments. Eating a simple diet, increasing fluid intake, and using over-the-counter medications as necessary can help reduce symptoms quickly.\nIn cases where the body does not respond to these treatments after 2 or 3 days, a person should visit their doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\nJohnson, Jon. \"What foods to eat if you have diarrhea.\" Medical News Today.

{"text":"Record low and negative interest rates in developed economies are fueling a ravenous search for yield that is forcing pension funds and other conservative institutional investors out of their comfort zones and into risky emerging markets, according to fund managers and analysts.\nThe reason for this has little to do with the attractiveness of EM investments. On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM debt by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield takes place behind the scenes, but it is not restricted to developed markets, where an estimated $1.7 trillion in bonds were offering negative yields last month. South Korea's state-run National Pension Service (NPS) announced this week that it would pour more than $40 billion into overseas equities and bonds over the next five years.\nThe NPS, which manages $483 billion and is the biggest investor in the Seoul market, had \"no choice\" but to look abroad for returns, according to the Korea Times, because domestic interest rates are low and set to fall further.\nPaolo Batori, global head of EM fixed income strategy at Morgan Stanley, foresees a fundamental shift in market dynamics. He said about 5 percent, or $80 billion, invested by insurance companies and pension funds in European government bonds would be switched into EM fixed income. Such an increase would roughly double the current exposure of such companies to emerging markets.\nMr. Batori uses the experience of Japanese life insurance companies after Japanese government bond yields declined in the aftermath of the financial crisis to reinforce his forecast. From the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of last year, Japanese life insurance companies increased their investments in foreign assets from just over 15 trillion yen to nearly 35 trillion yen as their search for yield intensified.\nBut where in EM should yield refugees from Europe go? In one sense, there is plenty of potential; emerging market countries account for around 40 percent of global GDP but only 14 percent of the global government bond market by value. And differences in yield are stark.\n\"In aggregate, (local currency emerging market debt) yields 6.5 percent — just above the average for the last five years, and a full 1.25 percentage points above the level preceding the May 2013 taper tantrum,\" said Denise Prime, an investment manager at GAM.\n\"With former safe havens looking so unappealing, local-currency emerging market debt is an attractive option for fixed-income investors,\" she added.\nBut, of course, yields such as these do not come without risk. One of the biggest concerns is that when the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy — though the timing for this is uncertain — funds could exit EM assets in favor of enhanced returns in the U.S.\nThe most vulnerable EM countries in such a scenario would be those that run hefty current account deficits and are therefore reliant on external financing. Such risks have been so well telegraphed that fund managers generally pursue a highly selective approach to EM assets.\nOne of the strategies deployed by investors to mitigate the risks of a strong dollar is to fund investments not by borrowing U.S. dollars but euro, which has depreciated or stayed steady against many EM currencies. In 2014, local EM currency bonds returned an average 7 percent against the euro and have returned 7.3 percent this year so far, according to Ms. Prime.\nIn a separate category, a large but relatively untapped opportunity lies in China. Some $1.5 trillion of the $4 trillion global market for EM local currency bonds is located within China's domestic market, accessible to foreign investors only through a tightly controlled quota system.\nBut for those investors able to access allocations, the returns can be attractive because of the higher interest rate environment in mainland China. The China Universal Enhanced Bond Fund, for example, returned 13.12 percent in 2014, according to China Universal, a Chinese asset manager.\n\"We are definitely seeing increasing interest from European investors, both retail and institutional, who are hunting for yield in a world that is not really delivering their return targets,\" said Christopher Gunns, a managing director at China Universal.\nBut, he notes that Chinese domestic debt stretches the comfort zone for some European investors. \"Among the institutional investors there are two things at play; a conservative risk budget competing with a need to generate returns.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-22T16:47:55Z","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/13/hunt-for-returns-forces-funds-into-emerging-market-debt.html"}

{"text":"The day Jeff Deardorff has been waiting a lifetime for has arrived.\nMajor League Baseball's annual amateur draft begins today and, by all expectations, Deardorff shouldn't have to wait long for his phone to ring.\nThe most pessimistic of scenarios would have him being taken in the fifth round. The most optimistic is a first round selection. Most likely, though, the call could come sometime during the second or third rounds.\nBaseball America has projected Deardorff, who graduated from South Lake High School Friday, as the 54th overall pick, which would make him a second round choice.\nDeardorff, though, isn't getting into guessing games about where, or even if, he is going to be taken.\n\"I have no idea,\" he said, about where he would be drafted. \"People have said a lot of things, but I don't want to say anything in case it doesn't happen.\"\nSouth Lake baseball coach Mike Crawford, though, thinks Deardorff will reach his long-time goal.\n\"His goal in life is to play pro ball,\" Crawford said. \"The team that gets him will be extremely fortunate. They will be getting a kid with a great work ethic and a love of the game.\n\"He is not going to give 110 percent, he is going to give 120 percent. He is a kid who not only can beat you with his bat, but with his speed and with his glove.\"\nDeardorff, who played third base for South Lake High School this year and was an outfielder before that, has been the object of desire by pro scouts this spring. Early this year, more than 20 scouts were showing up at games and practices to watch Deardorff's skill at the plate, his smooth fielding ability and his strong arm.\nDeardorff, who played for the U.S. Junior Olympic team last summer, finished this season with a .463 batting average, 8 home runs, 31 RBIs, 31 runs scored and 22 stolen bases.\nHe starred this weekend at the Florida Athletic Coaches Association's All-Star Games, and also has attended three or four workouts recently, including ones with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and New York Yankees.\nThe Montreal Expos, who have eight of the first 52 picks in the draft, also have shown a lot of interest as have the Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, Chicago White Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\"I saw where he is being projected between the first and fifth rounds. That is great when you consider all the collegiate players like (FSU's) J.D. Drew are also in there. I think he is going to go reasonably high. I think he will definitely go before the fifth round,\" said Crawford.\nDeardorff, who is an early baseball signee with the University of Miami, is just thankful that the day finally has arrived.\n\"It's a little bit of a relief,\" he said. \"I can get all of this out of the way and go out and play for a job.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-19T04:44:00Z","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1997-06-03-9706020278-story.html"}

Those include contracts for C-17 and C-130 military transport aeroplanes, advanced trainer jets and the French Rafale fighter jet.\nThe advanced trainer jet contract with Alenia Aermacchi of Italy was expected to be announced at the Dubai Airshow in November but was postponed because of unresolved issues surrounding the production of parts in the UAE, Mr Kahwaji said. “There are a lot of technical issues that go into these contracts and they can get very complicated,” he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T00:55:35Z","url":"https://www.globalresearch.ca/emirates-is-top-us-military-customer/16753"}
{"text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic lawmakers must soon decide whether President Barack Obama is leading them toward statesmanlike courage or political folly.\nObama used his first State of the Union speech Wednesday to push nervous Democrats to forge ahead on health care, despite voters' worries and opposition from newly strengthened Republicans. Sharpening his focus on the economy, he offered a hodgepodge of tax breaks and other incentives to create new jobs.\nFor Republicans, Obama blended a mix of overtures and digs. But he mainly addressed fellow Democrats, who still can enact his agenda if they overcome fears fueled by events such as last week's stunning GOP victory in the Massachusetts Senate race.\nThat setback may have cost Democrats their filibuster-proof Senate majority, Obama said, but \"we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills.\"\nHe accepted partial blame for the deep troubles facing his health care push, but he implored lawmakers to finish the task rather than yield to public opposition.\n\"The longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became,\" Obama told the joint session of Congress and a nationwide TV audience. But health care problems will continue for millions, he said, and \"I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.\"\nHouse and Senate Democratic leaders are scrambling to see if they can salvage the ambitious health care package, which Republicans almost universally oppose. Obama's pep talk was a call to arms, but he offered no new strategies for overcoming the steep parliamentary and political hurdles they face.\nThe president devoted most of his 65-minute speech to job-creation proposals, such as eliminating capital gains taxes on small business investment and extending tax breaks for businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. But those proposals also face uncertainty in Congress, where Senate Democrats say they may need a selective, piecemeal approach to win enough votes.\nObama said Republicans share a responsibility for governing, and he proposed meeting with their House and Senate leaders monthly. But his olive branch seemed brittle at times.\nWithout naming George W. Bush, he pointedly noted that the previous administration left him a big deficit and a deeply troubled economy. For good measure, Obama said the United States killed more al-Qaida terrorists in 2009 than in 2008.\nObama rebuked the Supreme Court for a recent decision that \"reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests\" and foreign corporations to make unlimited campaign contributions. At that, conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito made a dismissive face, shook his head in disagreement and seemed to mouth the words \"not true\" as the president spoke.\nRepublicans in the House chamber generally greeted such remarks with stony gazes and smirks. The statements they issued as soon as Obama finished — or even before he finished, in some cases — were equally icy.\n\"We had hoped to hear a new commitment to keep his promises to govern from the center, change the tone in Washington, and work with both parties in a bipartisan way to help small businesses create jobs and get our economy moving again,\" said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. \"Unfortunately, the president and the Democrats in charge of Congress still aren't listening to the American people.\"\nVice President Joe Biden, appearing in an interview Thursday morning on NBC's \"Today\" show, described Obama as upset with the way his program has been handled in Congress.\n\"One of the things that's most frustrating to him,\" Biden said, \"is the obstructionist ways of the United States Senate, on the part of the Republicans, requiring 60 votes, a supermajority, for virtually every single, solitary initiative we've had. Now that we have 59 votes, it's time for everybody to start taking responsibility.\"\nObama has the luxury of waiting until 2012 to seek re-election, while all 435 House seats and a third of the Senate seats are up for grabs this November. Some Democrats most nervous about the election are urging the administration to slow down, especially on the health care issue that has dominated Congress's attention for months.\nObama gave them no comfort. \"Change has not come fast enough\" for millions of Americans, he said. \"We must answer history's call.\"\nAt the same time, however, the president tried to give Democrats some political cover on other sensitive issues, such as the bank bailouts that angered many voters.\n\"We all hated the bank bailout,\" he said. \"I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\"\nThe president also tried to chip away at GOP talking points.\n\"Let me repeat, we cut taxes,\" he said, citing his administration's tax cuts \"for 95 percent of working families.\"\nRepublicans are quick to note that the deficit has soared during Obama's year in office, and proposals such as the health care overhaul would impose new taxes on high-end medical insurance policies, among other things.\nIn their post-speech commentaries, several Democrats ignored nearly all of Obama's remarks except those aimed at creating jobs, the biggest issue on voters' minds.\n\"His focus was right where it belongs: on jobs and the economy, and on reforming the financial sector,\" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. \"He acknowledged his own mistakes, and he avoided pointing partisan fingers.\"\nMichael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was less charitable.\nIf Obama is serious about improving the economy, Steele said, \"he will give Republicans a seat at the table. If not, then we know that this is just more spin, arrogance and a refusal to listen to the American people.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-20T23:06:00Z","url":"https://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20100128/NEWS/100129784"}

{"text":"'When Travis hollered, I was definitely flattered,' Kanye West's DJ says of getting the drummer's call.\nIt's been nearly a year since Travis Barker performed with a DJ, but now, he's getting ready to hit the road again, this time with Kanye West's main man behind the decks.\nBarker will be teaming up with turntablist A-Trak — West's touring DJ — for a run of shows, scheduled to kick off March 9-10 at Hollywood's Roxy Theatre. The gigs will mark the first time he's performed live with a DJ since the death of his partner DJ AM in August. But, as Barker told MTV News earlier this month, he had always considered working with Trak on a project of some sort. And after the two jammed a bit last year, both men knew they had to take their show to the stage.\n\"I had met A-Trak last year at Coachella, but I had seen a set of his at Avalon in Los Angeles maybe four years ago, with AM,\" Barker told MTV News. \"He was a guy who I always wanted to work with in some way. So I gave him a call.\"\n\"When Travis hollered, I was definitely flattered. We started by jamming once, back in the fall, just came over to the studio, and we did, like, one hour of jamming, which we thought was maybe a half an hour,\" A-Trak added. \"I just started playing records and scratching, and he was playing on top, and it went really, really naturally. It was very fluid. And we stopped and looked at the watch, and it was like, 'Oh, we've been playing for an hour and didn't even realize it.' And I think that solidified for both of us in our minds that we could do this pretty easily.\"\nThe duo will perform versions of each other's remixes (they've reworked tracks for everyone from Eminem and Soulja Boy Tell'em to MSTRKRFT and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), plus new material they've been working on in Barker's Los Angeles studio. Or, at least, that's the plan right now.\n\"It's going to be a mix of everything,\" A-Trak said. \"We're still kind of rehearsing it, but I think it's going to be some songs people recognize, some of the remixes Travis has done, some of my remixes. Just kind of mix it up.\"\nBarker said the duo plan to start small, with the pair of shows at Hollywood's Roxy Theatre, before taking the show wide. Additional shows will follow later in March in Las Vegas, Austin's South by Southwest and Miami.\n\"Our first shows are at the Roxy, and then South by Southwest will probably be a little bit bigger,\" Barker said. \"The Winter Music Conference in Miami will probably be a little bit bigger. But the first ones will be really intimate.\"\n\"We might do a run of side shows in health clubs and saunas,\" A-Trak laughed. \"Just set up in the steam bath and play. It was an idea we had yesterday.\"\nTickets go on sale Thursday. The show will kick off with Rob Roy and Kid Sister before Barker and A-Trak take the stage.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T02:38:50Z","url":"http://www.mtv.com/news/1632005/travis-barker-a-trak-talk-about-their-new-project-tour/"}

{"text":"Lynn Blake, left, teaches two hospital employees CPR at the VVMC Safety Fair. Blakeâs passion for educating Eagle County residents came from her own Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which a bystander provided CPR and saved her life. She was just 27 at the time.\nOn Valentine’s Day 2007, Lynn Blake was embarking on a new job in Vail Village when she had a rude awakening. The 27-year-old suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Fortunately for her, someone trained in CPR stepped forward and kept her heart beating until emergency personnel arrived with a defibrillator. If someone dropped in front of you unconscious, with no notable pulse, would you know what to do? Some 325,000 people die every year of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the United States. And, contrary to popular belief, it strikes people of all ages. “I did not know a thing about cardiac arrest. I didn’t know what it was,” Blake said. Now she knows firsthand about sudden cardiac arrest. The more she found out, the more she wondered why more people weren’t educated about SCA, the leading causes of death in the U.S. Just a few months after Blake’s sudden cardiac arrest, area pro biker Mike Janelle, in the prime of his life, died of SCA.”It’s a lot more common than people realize,” Blake said. Yet, she found, “no one’s really educating people about cardiac arrest.” That’s why she founded the Starting Hearts Foundation, partnering with the Vail Valley Medical Center and area emergency services. Starting Hearts is a non-profit dedicated to saving the lives of SCA victims, through communitywide CPR and AED (Automated External Defibrillation) education and access. “Vail Valley Medical Center embraces Lynn’s mission,” said Doris Kirchner, CEO and president of Vail Valley Medical Center. “VVMC is in the business of saving lives, and Starting Hearts can have a direct impact on that mission by engaging the community to help recognize and react to SCA appropriately.” Community key to saving lives Nearly 60 percent of cardiac arrests are witnessed. Most people know to call 911. But if that’s all you know about saving someone from SCA, the victim’s chance of surviving is slim. It is estimated 95 percent of cardiac arrest victims die before reaching a hospital if they do not receive shock treatment, such as from a defibrillator. That is why the response of bystanders is so critical to saving lives. Yet, Blake found the vast majority of people aren’t trained in CPR or using an AED. CPR classes tend to be taken only by those in jobs that demand the skill. Even if a layperson struggles to find a nearby course, it is difficult, Blake explains. Finding an AED is no easy task either. To address these issues, Starting Hearts acquired a decommissioned bus, and created the HeartRod, a mobile CPR/AED training unit, sponsored by Vail Valley Medical Center. Now, Blake, a certified instructor, travels to community events, Eagle County Schools and businesses teaching CPR and AED classes. “People aren’t going to come to me; I need to be able to go to them,” Blake said.Blake also created the event “All You Need is Heart,” which will take place on Feb. 14 at The Sebastian in Vail. The event focuses on personal heart health, including more than $1,200 worth of heart screens such as EKG’s, ultrasounds and cholesterols test. There are also feature presentations on endurance sports and the affects of high altitude, overcoming life’s challenges and savings lives in Eagle County. The event is $150 per person and is a fundraiser for Starting Hearts Foundation. Save more livesStarting Hearts will launch the ambitious “Save More Lives” campaign. “Our goal is to annually educate 25,000 people in Eagle County,” in CPR and AED, Blake said. As part of the campaign, Blake decided to apply the type of lessons every child has grasped. “If you ask anyone what to do if they catch on fire, they’d respond, ‘stop, drop and roll.’ Starting Hearts came up with a similar unforgettable message for SCA: ‘Call, push and shock.'” Dr. Lawrence Gaul is the Starting Hearts medical director. He was the cardiologist who treated Blake when she came into the Vail Valley Medical Center during her cardiac arrest episode. “It’s simple,” Gaul said, explaining Call, push and shock. “Call 911. Do rapid compressions in the middle of the chest and shock the person. When someone has a cardiac arrest the most important thing needed is shock.” That’s why, over the next year, the Save More Lives campaign will focus during on placing portable AEDs in strategic public places around Eagle County so anyone can find the nearest AED in emergencies.When Dr. Gaul traveled to Monaco for a medical conference, he was surprised to see this tiny country filled with street signs everywhere pointing to the nearest AED. By 2015, when the World Cup arrives in the Vail Valley, Dr. Gaul and Starting Hearts hope to have AEDs similarly available.To Blake, it is most rewarding when someone comes and tells her one of the classes she taught made a difference. There was the lady who took her class and was able to remove an object stuck in the throat of her choking grandchild through CPR. And the little girl who took one of her courses through the Youth Foundation and went home and practiced CPR with her family. “I encourage everyone in this community to get involved and participate in the Save More Lives campaign,” Blake said. “If everyone gets involved, we really can do it.”To participate in Save More Lives, find out about CPR and AED classes or to donate, contact Starting Hearts by emailing lynn@startinghearts.org or calling 970-331-3983.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T03:57:29Z","url":"https://www.vaildaily.com/news/vail-daily-health-story-call-push-shock/"}

{"text":"After competing many times, local artist Ann Iungerich and her husband, David, decided to share some lessons learned Saturday in an ice-sculpting workshop.\nThe concept was more sculptors might make for a better competition.\n\"We've done a lot of research and tried to figure out what's what. That was why we decided to have a workshop - what few little secrets we know, we're willing to share that with others,\" Ann explained.\nAnn and David Iungerich taught the half dozen participants how to chop away at the ice, just using wood chisels.\n\"Over the years, we've learned that just wood chisels work the best for us,\" Ann said. \"We don't bring any power tools. We just have different various sharp chisels and that's what we use.\"\nThere's typically six to eight teams each year, and the Iungerichs are hoping this workshop will expand involvement and break down the barrier for people who may be interested in competing themselves.\nAlthough she is an artist in many other mediums herself, Ann says she had never sculpted ice before her first year. After a friend suggested she try it, Ann said, \"Sure!\"\n\"I'm always up for a new adventure,\" Ann said.\nBut even as an artist herself, she said it was a little scary to start.\n\"It was a little bit intimidating, because we didn't know exactly how to do what we were doing, and yet it was exhilarating to watch, to take the blocks from nothing,\" she said.\nAnn says she competed that first year with her husband and her son. David said he was skeptical at first.\n\"I initially said no. She talked me into it, 'cause I had no clue, I'm not very artsy,\" he said. \"After that, we got hooked. It's a blast.\"\nAlex Vance, a fan of Iungerich's, decided to come to the workshop because she loves her work.\n\"I'm an Ann Iungerich fan, so I follow her,\" Vance said. \"Then she said: 'Here! Try it!' And now my hands are cold and I don't know what i'm doing. But it's fun!\"\nFor those intimidated by the ice and the chisel, Ann Iungerich has some advice: \"Sometimes I feel like we let fear rule our lives. Just jump in and try it. What's the worst that could happen? You could fail! Big deal, so what. It's just for fun. Just be part of a team and enjoy it.\"\nFor those who could not attend, a Facebook live of the event was filmed and Iungerich said they may upload it to YouTube. Iungerich also advised: \"Google ice sculpting or search YouTube and look at videos, how other people do it.\"\nFor her and her now-skilled family of ice sculptors, \"we just kind of, by trial-and-error, figured something out,\" she explained.\nThe Media Logic Radio's Ice Sculpting Competition will take place from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in downtown Fort Morgan. Iungerich said they usually provide the theme several days in advance, and encouraged anyone interested to get involved.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T18:06:11Z","url":"http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-local-news/ci_32308311/breaking-ice"}
{"text":"Why are American women dying in childbirth?\nMaternal mortality rates are falling in every industrialised nation - except for the United States.\nThe United States is not the first place that springs to mind when considering women dying in childbirth. So the fact that two American women die of pregnancy-related causes every day may come as a surprise.\nAccording to the World Bank, The US ranks 50th in maternal mortality globally - falling behind every other industrialised nation. A woman in the US is as likely to suffer a maternal death as a woman in sanctions-hit Iran, and four times as likely as a woman in Germany.\n\"It is a preventable health issue,\" said Amnesty International's Rachel Ward. \"It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for. We’re waiting for political will.\"\nWhat's worse is that US maternal mortality rates may actually be on the rise. Eugene Declercq, of Boston University's School of Public Health, produced a short film named Birth by the numbers, discussing maternal mortality in the US. In a 2013 follow-up report, he noted how mortality rates in other industrialised nations had declined - but in the US, it increased by 30 percent in the first decade of the new millennium.\nAnother 2013 report, this one by Truven Health Analytics, says the US spends more than any other country on costs associated with maternal healthcare. So why are American mothers still dying of pregnancy related deaths?\nThe answer is complex and belies simple solutions.\n\"There is sadly no magic bullet that explains what is behind the high levels of maternal mortality in the United States,\" Amnesty's Rachel Ward said. \"It's a combination of factors that speak to the systemic problems of failing to provide affordable, accessible, quality health services to all women in the United States.\"\nOne of these factors is likely the demographics of new mothers in the US.\n\"Our women are older. Our main maternal age has risen,\" said Dr Sarah Kilpatrick of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"We have a lot more women in their late 30s and 40s, when you have a higher chance of having other health issues such as cardiac disease.\" Obesity is also on the rise in the country, which also increases the chances of birthing complications.\nMany believe that the US healthcare system is in crisis. The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 47 million non-elderly US residents had no health insurance in 2012.\nUninsured pregnant women are eligible for Medicaid. But, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, they receive fewer prenatal care services, are more likely to enter pregnancy with health problems, and are more likely to have adverse maternal health outcomes.\nIt is a preventable health issue. It isn't something that we're waiting for a cure for. We’re waiting for political will.\nPoor women and women of colour are by far the hardest hit by this crisis. In 2012, 23 percent of African-American women and 36 percent of Hispanic women had no health insurance.\nA 2013 report by the New York Women's Foundation found that black women in New York City had a maternal mortality rate of 79 deaths per 100,000 live births - compared with 10 per 100,000 live births for white women. That means black women in New York have worse maternal mortality rates than women in either Syria or Iraq.\nThose numbers reflect a trend also cited in an Amnesty International 2011 follow up to its report, Deadly Delivery, which found that women in low-income areas were twice as likely to die a maternal death than women in high-income areas, and black women were four times as likely as white women to die while giving birth to a child.\nOpen Arms Perinatal Services in Seattle is one organisation trying to fill the gaps women are slipping through. Open Arms provides doula care, non-medical social and emotional support to low-income mothers.\n\"When Martin Luther King Jr was born, his mother did not have access to the local hospital because she was black, so we have this history of separating care,\" Open Arms Executive Director Sheila Capestany told Al Jazeera. \"So you build things into your systems that are really hard to undo, and you have to undo them intentionally, you can't just expect they're going to go away.\"\nShe believes that these community-based solutions are a crucial part of undoing the historical injustices that continue to resonate today.\nFocusing only on access to care obscures a more fundamental problem - whether that care is of a decent quality, even for those who can afford it.\nWhite women, the demographic most likely to have positive birth outcomes, and more likely to have health insurance, still have worse indicators than their counterparts in 24 other industrialised countries.\nIn the United States, if you define all births as 'potentially dangerous', then you would make the argument that you need a specialist for every birth. That perspective has persisted, and, given that, we've got a problem.\nIn almost every other industrialised nation, comprehensive maternal healthcare is inexpensive or even free. In Britain, midwives usually visit mothers at home two weeks after birth. In the Netherlands, more than 16 percent of births occur at home under the care of a midwife and are covered by insurance. In France, coverage includes a week's stay in the hospital, during which women also receive training in caring for her newborn.\nMost US insurance companies cover only what is considered medically necessary - and that usually means discharging women a day or two after birth with a single post-natal check-up six weeks after delivery. Ward, the managing director of Amnesty International's US programme told Al Jazeera this six weeks is a critical time period.\n\"Tameka McFarquhar, she was 22, she bled to death in her apartment in New York after giving birth,\" Ward said of one of the women featured in her research. \"She was alone, a home visit could have saved her life.\"\nAny area of neglect represents risks to maternal health, but with the right research and investment applied, such problems present opportunities to those working to reverse the numbers.\n\"Maternal death is not solved yet, but I think we’re making huge strides to reduce it,\" said Kilpatrick, the chair of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Cedars-Sinai.\nUS President Barack Obama's signature healthcare programme, the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have tried to change or repeal a number of times, aims to increase the number of Americans with health insurance. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists believes this could decrease the chances that women may become pregnant while already having potentially life threatening health problems.\nOne low-cost solution is the increased use of midwives. The majority of births around the world are attended to by midwives. In Britain, that includes 57 percent of births.\nStateside, fewer than eight percent of births are assisted by midwives. Most births are attended to by doctors, part of what makes maternal healthcare in the US so expensive.\n\"In the United States, if you define all births as 'potentially dangerous', then you would make the argument that you need a specialist for every birth. That perspective has persisted, and, given that, we've got a problem,” said Boston University's Declercq.\nThe problem is financial but it also may be medical. The rate of caesarean sections in the US is more than 30 percent - more than double the World Health Organisation's recommendation.\nExposing mothers to interventions such as caesarean sections when they are not necessary also exposes them to potential risks, say experts.\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recently released guidelines recommending that unnecessary caesarean sections should be reduced.\n\"In my mind, there is no doubt that our C-section rate is too high in the United States,\" said Kilpatrick of Cedars-Sinai. \"The good news is that it has plateaued. It's been the same for two to three years now.\"\nAmid the variety of medical and governmental changes that are being made, Capestany from Open Arms believes that there is also a basic social change that needs to be made in the way Americans understand childbirth.\n\"It's not intuitive in the United States that, in fact, childbirth is more than just a medical event. It is a physical event that requires medical attention, social attention, and emotional attention,\" Capestany told Al Jazeera.\n\"Until we acknowledge that, we're not going to be able to get the best care.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-21T09:05:45Z","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/03/why-are-american-women-dying-childbirth-201438161633539780.html"}
{"text":"MOVE Systems: redesigning NYC's 1970s-era food trucks for an eco-friendly future.\nMaking the less-noxious food cart into an art.\nThere are 5,000 licensed food carts in New York, and they’re as much of an urban icon as the MTA’s subway signage or the Chrysler building. Too bad they’re killing the planet.\nIt’s not the food—the grub is OK, if not exactly slimming; it’s the gas generators powering the carts. Most food carts run off a diesel generator that’s designed to run only a few hours. Vendors run them for stretches of up to 14 hours, leading to a high output of greenhouse-gas emissions such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, and particulate matter. You can see the smoke with the naked eye, but the hard facts are even more frightening: The research and consulting firm Energy Vision found that each cart produces the same amount of nitrous oxide as 186 cars on the road.\nA new pilot program between the city and a Queens-based company called MOVE Systems aims to cut down on that pollution by at least 60 percent. For the past year, MOVE has been fine-tuning a new kind of food cart—called the MRV100—that’s powered by a mix of battery-generated electricity and solar energy, instead of dirty gas. The plan calls for getting a fleet of 500 new carts up and running by the summer of 2016, with the first 100 slated to roll out this summer.\nFor a 40-or-so-year-old design, the typical food cart is actually pretty sturdy and resilient. “The quality is surprisingly good,” says Michael Dubrovsky, a co-founder of Simply Grid, which merged with Mobile Vending Natural Gas a year ago to form MOVE Systems. It’s good enough that MOVE initially planned to retrofit existing food carts with products akin to electric vehicle chargers, rather than manufacturing an entirely new line of carts. Then they took a closer look under the hood to discover that none of these carts has the same design. “Each one is made artisanally in Queens and Brooklyn, at what we call chop shops,” Dubrovsky says. “Each one has different compartments, the plumbing is not up to code, so by the time you rip all that out, all of a sudden you’ve put liability on yourself.” So MOVE had to scrap the magpie carts and start from scratch.\nOne hundred of the first carts will be funded by MOVE and reserved for disabled veterans, and the remaining 400 will go to vendors who sign up—at no cost to them, because the pilot program will be sponsored. (MOVE says they are still reviewing sponsors and advertisers and have yet to make a selection.) Vendors will still have to shoulder the costs of the compressed natural gas fuel (but not Internet connectivity), but Energy Vision’s report also suggests that running a food cart on grid power could save $5,200 a year in energy charges.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T13:06:16Z","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2015/05/move-systems-redesigning-nyc-s-1970s-era-food-trucks-for-an-eco-friendly-future.html"}

But each idea has been floated in some form in both 2017 and 2018, and Congress has not implemented any. The likelihood of any of these proposals being included in a final appropriations bill seems even slimmer now, with Democrats now in control of the House.\nManagement groups also criticized the White House’s approach to federal employee compensation. Although the Senior Executives Association was less overtly critical in its reaction, SEA President Bill Valdez said that the more positive elements of the fiscal roadmap would be undermined in practice by the decision to disinvest in the workforce.\n“Even as the budget proposal suggests that our national and homeland security requires additional staffing in the military and along our borders, the budget reiterates penny-wise and pound-foolish proposals to enact federal pay freezes and benefit and retirement cuts, thus implicitly assuring applicants interested in those posts that working for the federal government would mean enduring instability and ceaseless attacks surrounding even their most basic compensation,” Valdez said.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T17:15:18Z","url":"https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2019/03/trumps-budget-blueprint-how-ruin-civil-service/155484/?oref=relatedstories"}

He also ran for 42 yards.\n�When you know what guys are doing and you still can�t beat them, they�re just good at what they do,� said Newton, last year�s No. 1 overall draft pick .\nThe Panthers� only touchdown came on Captain Munnerlyn�s 33-yard interception return early in the third quarter.\nCarolina started the season with plenty of optimism with the return of Newton to lead a high-scoring offense, but the Panthers (1-4) couldn�t rebound a week after losing 30-28 to the Falcons on Matt Bryant�s field goal with 5 seconds left.\nThe offense never found a rhythm while Newton was frequently off target, completing just 3 of 15 passes for 40 yards in the first half.\nCarolina had two chances to take the lead in the final minutes Sunday only to come away empty each time.\nAfter driving the Panthers to the 1 for the fourth down play, Newton rolled to his right and spotted Ben Hartsock open in the end zone, but he threw a one-hopper on the short pass.\nThen, after the Seahawks took an intentional safety, Carolina got the ball back at its own 31 with 54 seconds left and no timeouts. That�s when Irvin, a rookie, stripped Newton for his second sack. Defensive tackle Alan Branch fell on the loose ball to seal the win.\nThe game marked a homecoming of sorts for Wilson, who first gained acclaim as a quarterback at North Carolina State. He also played minor league baseball in Asheville and Gastonia before returning to college football and finishing up at Wisconsin.\nThe rookie hadn�t thrown for more than 160 yards in a game until Sunday, but didn�t panic when he threw the two interceptions and bought time with his mobility on several plays.\nAfter Brandon Browner ripped the ball away from DeAngelo Williams and recovered the fumble to give Seattle a short field, Wilson moved the Seahawks to the Carolina 13 then found Tate over the middle. Tate spun off a hit from Thomas Davis around the 4 and into the end zone for the 13-10 lead.\nSteven Hauschka added his third field goal to make it 16-10 with about 10� minutes left.\nNotes: The Panthers played without three starters; cornerback Chris Gamble, linebacker Jon Beason and offensive lineman due to injuries. ...

They are oil tax revenue, where N4.3tn would be collected and non-oil tax revenue where the service had proposed to generate N4.5tn for the government.\nFurther breakdown of the oil tax revenue showed that the entire N4.3tn is expected to come from petroleum profit tax.\nFor the non oil tax revenue, an analysis of the document shows that N1.7tn is expected to be earned from company income tax, while gas income, capital gains tax and stamp duty are expected to earn N685.63bn, N6.27bn and N17.64bn, respectively for the government.\nAlso, Value Added Tax is expected to contribute N1.7tn; education tax, N275.39bn; consolidated account, N99.78bn and Nigeria Information Technology Development Fund, N20.01bn.\nThe FIRS in the document stated that the tax revenue target for 2019 was based on the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan of the Federal Government.\nIt said that to boost tax revenue, a lot of initiatives would be implemented with support from the government.\nSome of them are the expansion of Tax Identification database to cover federal, states and local government to establish a reliable VAT tax base across the country.\nWhile engaging relevant stakeholders, the service said it would develop and propose tax laws targeted at emerging sectors of the economy such as digital economies.\nIt said a review of existing tax laws to close the legal loopholes for taxes by adopting a sectoral, rules-based approach would be implemented.\nThe FIRS also stated that it would develop a strategy for revenue campaigns targeted at the informal sector of the economy, noting that a unified nationwide tax payer database would be developed.\nIt said a strong incentive programme aimed at encouraging tax payment by Nigerians would be designed.\nThe incentive, it noted, could involve tying government projects to tax revenue collected.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T10:14:36Z","url":"https://punchng.com/fg-to-raise-n6tn-from-petroleum-tax-vat/"}
{"text":"WHEN predicting which planets beyond Earth could support life, astronomers usually follow the water. Exoplanets with rocky surfaces are declared habitable if they orbit far enough from their star to potentially host oceans.\nBut as our planetary collection grows, and telescopes for studying them improve, some astrobiologists say it is time to narrow the hunt. Christopher McKay at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California has come up with an expanded “checklist” for habitability, which also considers factors like a planet’s light levels, radiation exposure and atmospheric composition (PNAS, DOI&colon; 10.1073/pnas.1304212111).\nSome items can be inferred just from knowing a planet’s probable composition and distance from its host star. Others will require photographing the planets and examining their atmospheres. Spacecraft with those capabilities are now being developed.\n“That doesn’t mean we are positioned to do it yet, but the discussion has gotten very detailed and very specific,” says Adam Burrows at Princeton University.\nThe list may one day pinpoint worlds that can be home to life even if conditions there would kill humans outright. For instance, McKay points to Chlamydomonas nivalis, or watermelon snow, a red-coloured alga that only grows in freezing water. And researchers have grown microbes in the lab at temperatures as high as 122 °C.\nEven planets with barely any water could host life, says McKay. Cyanobacteria, for example, live on rocks in the Atacama desert in Chile, which gets only a few days of rain and fog each year.\nAny life on another world would need sufficient light or geothermal energy to drive its vital processes. But this may not be a lot – deep-sea plants called red macroalgae can grow while receiving just 1 per cent of the sunlight hitting the ocean’s surface.\nAnd while high levels of ultraviolet radiation may be a worry for complex life, microbes are much hardier. The most extreme example is Deinococcus radiodurans, which can survive in the sort of conditions you might find inside a nuclear reactor.\nHowever, we know of one place that could rewrite McKay’s list. Saturn’s moon Titan has liquids on its surface and an atmosphere. Its seas are filled with methane and ethane, and its atmosphere is a choking haze of nitrogen and methane. That doesn’t seem so hospitable, but Titan has shown evidence of complex molecules that may be building blocks for life.\nWhen this article was first published, it described Chlamydomonas nivalis as a red alga. It is in fact a green alga with a red pigment.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T14:31:45Z","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229733-500-extreme-checklist-to-look-for-odd-life-on-other-worlds/"}

{"text":"Director Patty Jenkins has revealed details about the upcoming sequel.\nIf we've learned anything from our era of superhero movies, it's that no one is actually really dead. At the end of Wonder Woman, Chris Pine's Steve Trevor heroically sacrifices himself to save everyone else. It marked the death of some great on-screen chemistry between Pine and Gal Gadot.\nBut today, director Patty Jenkins has revealed the first details about the upcoming sequel, Wonder Woman 1984. It takes place in, well, 1984, and somehow marks the return of Pine's Steve Trevor. Jenkins tweeted a photo of Pine on set for the film, and he's got a great fit with a Member's Only jacket and a vintage Casio watch. He also looks pretty damn good for being either dead or at least 90 years old. Considering this is a superhero movie there are any number of reasons why Trevor would still be alive.\nThis sequel has Wonder Woman squaring off against The Cheetah, played by Kristin Wiig. While there have been a few versions of The Cheetah, all the characters have roughly the same powers, which \"consists of enhanced strength and speed well beyond that of the most powerful felines, as well as heightened senses of smell and hearing for hunts and night-vision for stealth. Their reflexes and agility are similarly augmented, allowing them superior gymnastic and parkour feats for inhuman mobility. These superhuman traits allow them to challenge Wonder Woman in physical battles. Additionally, their fangs and claws are preternaturally sharp and strong.\"\nAnyway, we'll know for sure when the movie is out on November 1, 2019.\nCan 'Wonder Woman' Get a Best Picture Nomination?","timestamp":"2019-04-20T07:17:20Z","url":"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a21344180/wonder-woman-1984-chris-pine/"}

{"text":"Mattel's Future: Happily Ever After?\nMattel has a plan for the rest of the year, but it seems to be playing a shorter game.\nAccording to its most recent earnings release, Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) seems to have become a victim of its own success. The company reported a 12% drop in revenue from its Barbie brand, while other girls' toys ate up market share. The American Girl and Monster High lines did particularly well, but the cost was high. As the newer lines continue to succeed, the questions around Barbie's future grow.\nMonster High is leading the way at Mattel, and analysts now believe that the business may be worth up to $500 million annually. That success has helped steer Mattel toward new opportunities, including a variation on Monster High -- which is a line of monsters in high school -- called Ever After High. The new line is going to hit stores in the second half of the year, and focuses on classic fairytale characters while they're in high school.\nWhen I say \"classic fairytale characters,\" I, of course, mean slightly rebranded Disney (NYSE:DIS) princesses. The list includes Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella-style characters, along with some princes, and Alice-in-Wonderland themed dolls.\nThe move makes an incredible amount of sense for Mattel, as Disney has had runaway success with its rebranding of the princesses as a separate line. According to analyst studies, the Princess line is generating $3 billion in annual global sales. That's six times what Monster High is pulling in, and highlights the value available in the marketplace. Since Mattel is only spending $10 million to $20 million to develop the spin-off lines , the payback is almost immediate.\nThe stock suffered a 7% drop yesterday in light of the shortfall from Mattel. Overall, the company managed a 1% increase in global sales, but it had a 25% drop in earnings per share . The long game for Mattel looks increasingly like an ever evolving line of girls' toys. While the company has had success with boys' lines, its real core lies in girls.\nOn the competitive side, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) seems to have boys' toys locked down. The company is generating more than twice as much from its boys' toys as it does from girls' toys. That success is resting on the strength of Marvel-branded toys, G.I Joe, and NERF. Mattel is a much larger company, and Hasbro has to be content to simply succeed where it can.\nFor Mattel, the most interesting thing to come over the next year may be the conflict that arises between Mattel and Disney, if its Ever After brand takes off. Right now, Mattel produces a number of toys with the Disney branding, and it relies on a good relationship with the media company. Disney may start to see some encroachment on its territory, which could lead to a confrontation. But first, Ever After has to succeed.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T11:47:10Z","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/07/18/mattels-future-happily-ever-after.aspx"}

It is Lilly's job to distract evil creatures from the deep and dark, while his master Annalise burns them with primal green fire. They keep on saving the world from some pretty nasty demons that have crossed over.\nWooden Men aren't supposed to last more than one mission, but somehow Ray keeps on surviving.

{"text":"Most gardeners think of diascias as low-growing bedding plants suited to a summer container or the front of a sunny border.\nHowever Diascia personata breaks the mould and produces stiff stems that grow 3ft tall. The substantial bright green foliage supports dusky pink flowers and these appear in profusion from early May to November.\nHandsome, upright and show-stopping, it first came to my attention when Fergus Garrett of Great Dixter in East Sussex brought it to a Perennial Plant Day at RHS Wisley in June last year.\nHaving never seen it before I then spotted it two days later on a Hopleys' stand (see details below) and snapped it up.\nAlthough the form I acquired was labelled 'Hopleys', it is the same plant grown at Great Dixter.\nDiascias are found on the eastern side of southern Africa. There are 70 species in all and most are annual, but there are a few perennials.\nThey are members of the Scrophularia or figwort family, together with verbascum and buddleia, although the whole tribe has recently been reclassified.\nThe common name of diascia is \"twinspur\" and this refers to two spurs found at the back of the flower. The closely related genera Alonsoa and Nemesia look similar, but have more spurs - often these are longer.\nAlthough diascias flower for months in Britain they have a much shorter flowering season in their native land because they are pollinated by a different species of bee: Bees from the genus Rediviva (native to southern Africa) have extra long forelegs, and this allows them to reach the spurs of the flowers in order to collect a fatty oil produced by the glands.\nThe legs of the bee soak up the oil, rather like a sponge, and pollen is transferred to the body of the bee during this process. The flowers are then pollinated and fade. Our native bees have shorter legs and so fail to pollinate the flowers.\nIn the wild, different species of diascia growing together evolve and produce stamens of varying lengths, or in varying positions, so that any pollen deposited sticks to different parts of the bee's body.\nThis system prevents cross-pollination. But if the necessary species of bee is absent, the flowers are not pollinated, so flower longer.\nThe late plant breeder and hobbyist, Hector Harrison, of Appleby, in South Humberside, found out about diascia's pollination needs and began hand-pollinating three species about 1978. His first hybrids flowered in the mid-Eighties and he generously gave them to nurseries and enthusiasts.\nHarrison hybrids include 'Appleby Apricot', 'Iceberg', 'Salmon Supreme' and 'Lilac Belle'. White, lilac, various pinks and apricot diascias are all available.\nSome of these hybrids may be sterile even if they encounter the long-legged bees required for pollination: sterility often occurs when two closely related species hybridise.\nHarrison was, however, unaware of the first British-raised diascia. The late John Kelly, once curator at Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens, applied the pollen from D. cordata to D. barberae. He grew nine seeds and named the best red-pink 'Ruby Field' after a lady who sometimes worked on the nursery.\nIt is now listed under D. barberae in the RHS Plant Finder so may not even be a hybrid. The diascia gene pool was further expanded when new species were collected in the Seventies for the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens.\nDiascia personata is a perennial from the Eastern Cape and hardier than the annual forms. It will survive most winters given a sunny position and well-drained soil.\nIts hardiness equates roughly to the dahlia in my opinion and \"insurance\" cuttings should be taken in early summer, in case of a hard winter.\nSometimes another plant, the similarly upright D. rigescens, is mistaken for D. personata and the flowers are a similar colour.\nThey are, however, significantly different: D. rigescens is shorter, between 1-2ft and the foliage a duller blue-green. It has less stature. I have successfully over wintered both of these, but last winter saw them off.\nDiascias are sun-loving plants, but enjoy fertile rather than dry, poor soil. The cushion-forming types can get straggly so cut them back in late April and late August to keep them compact.\nHardiness can be a problem, but many will survive winter in well-drained soil.\nCuttings can be taken between May and September. However, if you want to keep cuttings through the winter take them in the first half of summer so that a good root system is developed.\nLook for new growth that has started to harden slightly, preferably without flower buds. Cut off just below the node (the bumpy part where leaves are attached) so that your cutting measures roughly 4in long. Trim the cutting just below the bumpy node and strip any lower leaves.\nPlunge into a suitable rooting matter. This could be a mixture of compost and horticultural sand. I prefill small seed trays with damp horticultural sand and plunge cuttings in as I take them. No rooting compost or special equipment is needed.\nYou can containerise Diascia personata, but it has to be a substantial pot to balance the height of the plant. The ruby-pink flowers are excellent with dark blue agapanthus, purple dahlias or fluffy pennisetums.\nAt Great Dixter they use D. personata with the green and cream vertically striped grass, Miscanthus sinensis var. condensatus 'Cosmopolitan' to great effect. Graham Gough, of Marchants Plants, also uses it in his grass-led garden and he describes it as \"remarkable and lofty\".","timestamp":"2019-04-19T14:49:16Z","url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/gardeningadvice/7810692/How-to-grow-Diascia-personata.html"}

{"text":"The Airline Vikings were playing for the state football championship in 1972 against Neville on a bad night for football in Monroe.\nBut after the team had gathered itself, head coach Jack Gray called his seniors together.\nGray, who coached the 1967 Airline team to the state title, passed away Thursday and services are set for Saturday at 3 p.m. in Marshall, Texas, where he lived. Visitation is Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.\nGray’s niece, Becky Gray, is the assistant principal at Parkway and his brother lives in Bossier City. He is survived by his wife, Mimi, and a son, Gary who lives in Farmerville.\nSlack said Gray was the kind of coach any teenager would love to have.\n“He was caring, loving and gentle, but he always expected the best out of you,” Slack said.\nIn 1971, Slack said it was well known that Gray, a native of Shelbyville, Texas, went to Marshall to interview for the head coaching job there.\nWhen the Vikings played at Texarkana, Arkansas, as juniors, the team had a huge defensive end named Ronald Johnson, the brother of NFL All-Pro Gary “Big Hands” Johnson.\n“Ronald had a forearm that would knock you out and he injured a couple of the Texarkana players. They were the top team in Arkansas and we beat them,” Slack said. “The next year when we play them, they’re out to get Ronald and it started a huge fight at the end of the game, which was never finished. They were chasing Ronald all over the field, so he finally ran to our sideline and picked up one of the downs markers and started swinging it at them.\nGray was originally hired at Airline by John Ropp not long after Airline opened in 1964. He also coached at Ruston High and then later at Marshall, where he was also athletic director and an administrator.\nAfter retirement, Gray and his wife were active in delivering “Meals on Wheels” and working with the Humane Society.

{"text":"In the summer of 1993, I had one of those experiences that stay with me for the rest of my life.\nI spent 10 weeks in Europe, beginning with a six-week law-school summer session at Charles University in Prague.\nPrague was, as much as any place, the cradle of culture in central Europe, and it was sometimes the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. Its ancient center was architecturally and many other ways romantic and gorgeous. Because it was subject only to rather minor bombing, Prague’s charm and beauty were nearly unscathed by World War II.\nBut 45 years of socialist “compassion” under a Soviet Union puppet regime had turned everything soot gray and ugly before eastern and central Europe was liberated in 1989.\nWhen I arrived, you could walk down the winding cobblestone streets of the Old Town near its famous castle amid five-story ancient residential buildings standing shoulder-to-shoulder against narrow sidewalks on both sides. Buildings that had once been vibrant with color, exquisite in their features and soaring to the sky were now soot-gray dingy, decaying and seemingly drooping in shame.\nThen, out of nowhere, came one that was a brilliant pastel lime-green, fully restored and bursting with light and life. Then soot-gray, soot-gray and suddenly another one, bright pink, restored to its original glory. Soot-gray, soot-gray, soot-gray. And another beauty reclaimed in rich mustard yellow.\nAnd then, across the street, amid more weeping soot-gray ghosts, a sight that explained everything: One of the old wrecks with its entire face covered with … scaffolding. The secret of a second Prague Spring was revealed as people liberated from the yoke of coercive collectivism and soaring in restored liberty were scrubbing away the toxic dirt of statist oppression, rebuilding the decorative art that was their heritage, and baptizing it all with lovely color.\nIt was especially moving because in 1968 I had been an ardent fan of the (first) Prague Spring, led by a Czechoslovakian freedom movement that was brutally crushed in the city’s main square by Soviet tank squads.\nThis month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the stunning 1989 collapse of the Soviet and Eastern Block, highlighted by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the liberation of Prague and eastern and central Europe.\nGrowing up in the 1950s with basement bomb shelters, air-raid sirens and duck-and-cover drills in response to threats from that truly Evil Empire created even in children an abiding sense of unease — an understanding that serious threats were afoot in the world. As the Cold War became normalcy, there was vague despair for three more decades at a world locked in continuing tension due to the menace we thought was permanent because its evil controlled the world’s second most powerful nation and others. With all that exacerbated by the rise of Red China, it seemed like a nightmare that would never end.\nThen, of a sudden, there was light in the world as the Evil Empire simply crumbled, being unable to keep up with the West’s prosperity brought by the renewed commitment to freedom of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and others. The unimaginable happened: The bad guys simply folded and communism collapsed due to its own “internal contradictions”.\nToday, we face domestic challenges from progressivism, socialism’s close cousin. We face serious international challenges from terrorism, much of it ideological or religion-based and some of it just insane. I don’t minimize these challenges. However, whenever I feel daunted by them, I remember the second Prague Spring and the collapse of something even bigger and worse that we thought would never end, and I’m hopeful.\nRon Knecht is an economist, law-school graduate, higher education regent and Nevada controller-elect.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T14:48:24Z","url":"https://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/lahontan-valley/second-prague-spring-and-hope-for-the-future/"}

Therefore, we plan to increase the transit level of gas through Belarus,” Kupriyanov said.\nUkraine, however, has denied it is siphoning off gas from transit pipes.\nAlso, according to Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Grushko, Russia has asked the EU parliament to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue of Russian gas transits via Ukraine.\n“Gazprom representatives are ready to head to Brussels, and all European countries, to fully inform them about the dispute between Gazprom and Ukraine's Naftogaz,” he said.\nEarlier Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said that independent auditors are being blocked from checking whether gas supplies to Europe are being hindered.\n“We don't have an effective gas delivery contract with Naftogaz now. Naftogaz is currently obstructing the operators of RosUkrEnergo and is not letting them extract the gas from underground facilities which they have,” said Kupriyanov.\nThere is still no contract signed between the two countries and debts must be paid in full before another can be signed. The Russian energy company has also calculated over $US 600 million in penalties Ukraine owes.\nGazprom’s overall supply reduction amounted to 90 million cubic metres a day, which is roughly Ukraine’s consumption.\nBoth Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko have appealed to Russia not to cut gas supplies to the country and to continue talks. They've also named the price their country is prepared to pay for the gas: $US 201 per 1,000 cubic metres.\nGazprom, though, wanted a higher price – $US 250 per 1,000 cubic metres – which is almost half the market price. Ukraine turned down this offer. A statement by Gazprom followed that it would now sell gas to Ukraine at the market price of $US 418.\nAs Europe depends on Russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies, and the fact that 80% of their supplies pass through Ukrainian pipelines, it is watching the ongoing conflict closely.\nAfter Russia had announced a new gas price for Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko said it would be “logical” that transit costs should go up too. The Ukrainian leader said that talks with Russia are to be resumed shortly with the final agreement to be reached by the time of the Orthodox Christmas, January 7.\nA Ukrainian delegation has set off on a tour of Europe, which aims at informing the European Union about the gas situation and to provide guarantees that the gas will be transported across Ukraine as normal. Also, Ukraine's president Yushchenko has sent letters to the leaders of eight countries and to the European Commission to explain his reasons of the gas dispute.\nEarlier Ukraine had threatened to confiscate Russian gas passing through the country, refusing to guarantee supplies to Europe as Russia promises to stop gas supplies to Ukraine due to debts. Gazprom called Ukraine’s reaction ‘blackmail’.\nAs Gazprom has vowed to maintain supplies to Europe in full, its gas will be entering Ukraine for the foreseeable future, at least until the Nord or South Stream is opened.\nOne major pipeline – bringing gas to Ukraine – passes through the town of Kursk, while a larger one – taking gas to Europe – operates in Voronezh (see picture).\nMeanwhile, German gas company E.ON Ruhrgas has taken precautions in case supplies of Russian gas are hampered. Its press secretary Helmut Roloff said that the company has agreed on additional gas supplies from Norway in case of emergency. Nevertheless, on Friday, they received all the gas they had ordered.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T14:48:55Z","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/ukraine-steals-european-gas/"}
{"text":"Finland faces heightened risks from links between radical Islam and terrorism, according to a fresh report by Finland’s security and intelligence police unit Supo. The unit points to the ongoing Syrian conflict as a source of the increased threat.\nAccording to the Supo assessment, in spite of the increased risk of radical Islam fomenting terrorism, Finland is still not a primary target for terrorist organisations.\nThe security police add that the risk of al-Qaeda-led attacks against Finland or Finns is still low, even though around 40 people have travelled from Finland to Syria to join Islamist groups there.\nAccording to Tuomas Portaankorva of Supo there is an ongoing traffic of fighters between Finland and Syria, with some returning from the war and others going back to Syria after a break in Finland.\n\"They can take on a more radical world view than before,\" said Supo head Antti Pelttari.\nThe evaluation of an increased threat refers to violence that may be perpetrated within local borders without external guidance. Interior Minister Päivi Räsänen says that Finland has around 200 higher-risk individuals.\n\"We have more of those high risk individuals, they have more contact to extremist ideologies and extremist actions,\" said Räsänen. \"They have been there, received training. That's why this threat level has been raised.\"\nSupo said that there are more people in Finland with links to terrorist organisations. They unit reports increased numbers of people travelling to conflict areas in Syria as well as those who have returned from engaging in war tourism.\nAccording to Supo it has no information about concrete terrorism operations targeting Finland. However the intelligence organization has warned that the operations of networks with links to Syria and the activities of private individuals are unpredictable and difficult to anticipate.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T19:00:07Z","url":"https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/security_police_increased_radical_islamist_threat_in_finland/7294632"}
{"text":"1. Drew Griffin, the CNN investigative correspondent whose reporting made VA health care delays a national news story, told me that the VA ignored questions from reporters at their peril.\nHis first attempt to reach VA secretary Eric Shinseki - who resigned under pressure on Friday - was way back in November. \"Basically, they have tried to shut down our reporting by refusing to talk to us,\" Griffin said. Here's the rest of the conversation.\n\"These are performances and if there's no one to perform to, if there's no audience, there's no reason to perform,\" Cullen said. He said the media should seek ways to \"take away part of the stage.\"\nGreenfield said he understood the impulse - \"I think it's an effort somehow to take away from these killers what we think they might want\" - but called it \"ultimately futile because in this day and age, unlike 40 years ago, there are no gatekeepers.\"\nI also talked with Cosmopolitan editor in chief Joanna Coles about the #YesAllWomen hashtag movement.\n3. Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg - whom Edward Snowden has called an \"inspiration\" - said Snowden has been an inspiration to him, too.\n4. \"It's planned with a kind of Normandy-level precision,\" Mark Leibovich, author of \"This Town,\" said of the roll-out of Hillary Clinton's memoir \"Hard Choices.\"\nHe said the press should be treating the book roll-out as if it is the start of a Clinton presidential campaign, \"because the Clinton people are.\"\nCarl Bernstein, author of \"A Woman In Charge,\" said his \"Normandy\" reference was spot-on: \"The presidential campaign is like a war. It's fought on a huge battlefield with great dangers everywhere and all kinds of strategy required.\"\n5. Bernstein also said this, when I brought up the fact that Clinton will be interviewed by Fox News hosts Bret Baier and Greta Van Susteren in mid-June: \"It's not just reach out to people who will need some persuading. It's the publicity that will be generated by the Fox interview and the expectation - by people in the Clinton retinue - that she is going to be able to run some circles around her interviewers. And I suspect - you never know - that that might well be the case.\"\n6. I interviewed Ta-Nehisi Coates (above) about his Atlantic cover story, \"The Race for Reparations,\" and about how racial injustices are covered by the media.\n\"I think race is covered in a way that we cover most things in the media, and that is that there is a bias towards spectacle,\" he said.\n\"Like, when Donald Sterling says something, that means something. When Cliven Bundy, this spectacle, says something, that means something. And this presents great difficulty for those of us who are concerned about the force of racism in American life, because much of it is not spectacle.\nHe added, \"But I think that is the challenger of any storyteller.

{"text":"How it feels when J.K. Rowling gives us more \"Harry Potter\" information.\nJ.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" universe is enormous. And since closing the book on the main series in 2007, she keeps adding to it. There are spinoff books, movies, and a play in the franchise — many of which reveal new insight about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other characters from the original series.\nThe wealth of \"Harry Potter\" material also means that there's a wealth of behind-the-scenes information that yields new details of how J.K. Rowling thought up the books, how the filmmakers made the movies, and a ton of other information about the \"Harry Potter\" universe. Rowling even launched Pottermore, which has become a sort of ever-evolving encyclopedia of trivia and back-stories from her world.\nIt's a lot to keep up with. But for \"Harry Potter\" fans, all of it is fascinating.\nHarry Potter is rich, because his ancestor was a pharmaceutical tycoon.\nHarry Potter finding out he's loaded in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nOne of the first things Harry does when he finds out he's a wizard way back in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" is visit the Gringotts wizarding bank in Diagon Alley. After all, he'll need some cash to buy school supplies for Hogwarts.\nIn his vault, he finds out that he has piles and piles of gold galleons. Harry's rich! Way more rich than most of his friends. Why? The books don't really explain. But Rowling addressed the issue on Pottermore.\nIn the 12th century, Harry's ancestor Linfred of Stinchcombe developed pharmaceutical remedies that were the basis for Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. He built a business out of it, and the Potter family maintained the fortune for generations. Some time later, Harry's grandfather Fleamont Potter — the son of the \"original\" Harry Potter — quadrupled the family fortune with hair potion. The hair potion is even advertised in a stray newspaper in \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nGringotts does exchanges between magical and muggle money.\nA Gringotts goblin from \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nAs J.K. Rowling pointed out, it's the only way Muggle-born wizards and witches could buy wands, since Ollivanders only takes galleons, knuts, and sickles — not pounds or euros.\nThere's one character from the books who existed in real life.\nAn engraved portrait of Nicolas Flamel.\nIn Rowling's series, Nicolas Flamel is the alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone, the magical object at the center of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" that can grant a person immortality.\nIn real life, Flamel was a French scholar and bookseller who lived in the 14th and early 15th centuries. After his death, he got a reputation as an alchemist who secretly achieved immortality. Rowling wrote about the inspiration on Pottermore, where she said Flamel attended the French wizarding school Beauxbatons in her version of his life.\nGreen gloves were used to make the books fly around in the Hogwarts library.\nEmma Watson as Hermione in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\"\nFor the movies — particularly a scene in \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\"— the books in the Hogwarts library have a knack for organizing themselves on shelves. The secret behind the magic is that green gloves were used. They worked the same way green screen does, and were wiped away in post-production so it looked like the books floated on their own.\nThere were two Harry Potters.\nThe Mirror of Erised scene in \"Sorcerer's Stone.\"\n\"Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913 - 1921. Henry caused a minor stir when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, who had forbidden the magical community to help Muggles waging the First World War. His outspokenness on the behalf of the Muggle community was also a strong contributing factor in the family's exclusion from the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight.'\"\nThe original Harry Potter didn't show up in the books, but he lived around the time of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" So don't rule him out for a surprise appearance in the movie series.\nThe film designers have been hiding a secret character in the movies' fake newspapers.\nWhat does Harry know about the Ginger Witch?\nThe Fourth Estate is an important part of Rowling's universe. The Daily Prophet covers magic in Britain and The New York Ghost covers the same in the United States.\nIn almost every \"Harry Potter\" movie, it was the design firm MinaLima that put together the fake newspaper props for different scenes. They had fun with it. Throughout the series, you can spot stories about \"The Ginger Witch.\" She's a hooligan with a multinational criminal past spanning decades.\n\"We know now that things do get seen,\" designer Miraphora Mina told INSIDER. \"In the past, we didn't realize how much these would be scrutinized by fans.\"\nRead about all of the Ginger Witch's exploits here.\nThere's a perfume company that exists in the background of both the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies.\nDumbledore in front of a Divine Magic poster in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and a poster for the same brand featured in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nAnother one of MinaLima's inventions is the Divine Magic perfume company. We first see it in a poster behind Albus Dumbledore in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" when he meets with Harry at the beginning of the film. In \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" there's a street poster advertising the same brand more than half a century earlier.\nBefore becoming headmaster, Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.\nMichael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore.\nDumbledore is an academic and something of a magical genius. As his chocolate frog card attests, he's \"particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\" So it makes sense that he was a teacher at the wizarding school, not just the administrator.\nIt was while Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher that Tom Riddle — later to become Lord Voldemort — attended Hogwarts. He also taught Newt Scamander, the main character in \"Fantastic Beasts,\" with whom he has a close bond. An issue of the publication \"Transfiguration Today\" in the movie has an article featuring his work. Jude Law is slated to play Dumbledore in the forthcoming \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies, which will be about taking down his rival Gellert Grindelwald.\nNewt Scamander was a Hufflepuff.\nScamander's scarf gives it away.\nSpeaking of Newt Scamander and Hogwarts, the character — played in \"Fantastic Beasts\" by Eddie Redmayne — was sorted into the Hufflepuff house. You might have spotted his canary-and-black scarf throughout the movie, signaling Hufflepuff's colors.\nJ.K. Rowling wanted \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" to look like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nThe cover of \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\"\n\"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" was a biography written by Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist hell-bent on destroying his reputation. For the movies, Rowling wanted to reflect the poor, salacious quality of the book. So she told MinaLima to make it overwrought like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nMACUSA president Seraphina Picquery has a big throne that looks like Dumbledore's from Hogwarts.\nHer golden throne in \"Fantastic Beasts\" was intentionally made to be a visual reference to Dumbledore's in Hogwarts's Great Hall.\n\"There were props designed to connect the film back to the 'Harry Potter' series,\"supervising modeller Pierre Bohanna wrote in \"Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nColin Farrell didn't read a single page of \"Harry Potter\" before reading J.K. Rowling's script for \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nHe watched the movies, though.\nFarrell told SFX Magazine earlier this year that he was a big fan of the \"Harry Potter\" movies, but he didn't read any of J.K. Rowling's work before reading her script. He wanted to play the role of auror Percival Graves based on that screenplay alone.\nThere's a good reason the Horcrux inside Harry wasn't destroyed in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nHarry getting bitten by the basilisk in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nFor years, \"Harry Potter\" fans wondered what, exactly, was going on with the portion of Voldemort's soul that was inside Harry. When Voldemort tried and failed to kill Harry himself, he ended up inadvertently leaving a Horcrux inside him.\nBut if that's the case, why wasn't it destroyed when the Basilisk in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" bit Harry, just as its poison-infused fang destroyed the horcrux that was in Tom Riddle's diary?\n\"A Horcrux can only be destroyed if its container is damaged beyond repair,\" Rowling explained. \"Harry was healed by Fawkes. Had he died, the Horcrux would indeed have been destroyed.\"\nMany of the spells are derived from Latin roots.\nWhen coming up with magical spells, Rowling clearly worked her studies of Classical language and mythology at the University of Exeter. Many of them are based in the Latin language. \"Accio,\" for example, sounds like \"accerso,\" which means \"to summon or fetch.\" \"Wingardium Leviosa,\" the summoning charm, from from the word \"wing\" (referring to flight); \"ard\" (from the Latin \"aardus,\" which can mean \"elevated\"); and \"levi\" (which means \"to lift\").\nJ.K. Rowling wrote a \"Harry Potter\" prequel short story — and the original copy was stolen.\nIn 2008, Rowling hand wrote an 800-page story about James and Sirius Potter noodling around on magical motorcycles and escaping some muggle cops. You can read it here. She auctioned it off for charity, but in April of 2017, that handwritten draft was stolen and it hasn't been found to this day.\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore has a specific meaning for each of his names.\nYes, that's his full name.\nRowling is famous for her memorable, magical character names. She's put a lot of thought into them, and a lot of the names refer to some deeper meaning for each character. Dumbledore, as the character with the most names, might be the best example.\n\"Albus\" is Latin for \"white,\" which could be symbolic or just refer to his beard. \"Percival\" was one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, who went in search for the lost grail. \"Wulfric\" may be a reference to the 12th-century British figure Wulfric of Haselbury, who was known as a miracle worker. And \"Brian\" is often thought to be derived from an Old Celtic word that roughly means \"noble.\"\n\"Dumbledore\" is one name that Rowling has discussed explicitly. It's an Old English word for \"bumblebee.\"\n\"Because Albus Dumbledore is very fond of music, I always imagined him as sort of humming to himself a lot,\" Rowling said in a 1999 interview.\nSome of the food in the movies was real.\nOne of the highlights of the \"Harry Potter\" movies and books are the feasts in the Hogwarts Great Hall. Shepherd's pie, Yorkshire pudding, and pumpkin juice seem to be served at every meal. During the epic feast scene in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" many of the dishes were actually cooked up for a more realistic effect. In general, the food was fake and made with resin.\nThe glass bottles in Snape's potions classroom was filled with really weird stuff.\nThere's probably gross stuff in there.\nThe movie's set designer found things like tufts of hair and unwanted guts and bones from local butchers for the potion ingredient vials. The room itself also expanded between movies, making room for more extras in later entries in the series.\nFour different owls played Hedwig, Harry's owl, in the movies.\nMore than 12 rats played Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, four cats played Hermione's pet Crookshanks, and nine Neapolitan Mastiffs played Hagrid's dog, Fang.\nMovie producers stood in for the Hogwarts moving portraits.\nThe portraits that line the walls of Hogwarts castle in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, Orlando.\nOne of the magical castle's features is that it has paintings that move. Some of them had plot significance, like the Fat Lady in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" who was played by comedian Dawn French. Others, though, were played by the movie's producers, who wanted to immortalize themselves in some way on screen.\n15,000 glass orbs were made for the Room of Prophecy scene in \"Order of the Phoenix.\" None of them were used.\nYou can still see the orbs on the Warner Bros. studio tour in London.\nIn the end, the producers decided to digitize the whole thing and none of the orbs made it to the movies.\nThe Black family tree wasn't canonized until the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie.\nThe Black family is one of the oldest and most important in the wizarding community. There's Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, who's cousins with Voldemort's right-hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange, and there's also Regulus Arcturus Black, who tried to destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and Phineas Nigellus Black, a former headmaster of Hogwarts.\nIt's confusing, and the books refer to a big tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius's family home, that features a family tree that lays it all out. But the actual content of that tapestry isn't entirely included in the books, so there are some gaps.\nFor the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie, designer Miraphora Mina needed to include the tapestry in one of the scenes. So she called up J.K. Rowling, who mapped out the entire Black family for her. It's only from the movie that we have all of the relationships specified.\nIt took six months to design the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes scene in \"Half-Blood Prince.\"\nA display of packaging from Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes.\nThe joke shop — which Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to at the beginning of the movie — is filled with whizzing magical pranks, bubbling potions, and everything from Anti Gravity Hats to Self-propelling Custard Pies. It's a feat of imagination and hard work from Fred and George Weasley, and it all had to be re-created for the movie.\nMinaLima made the boxes and labeling for every single item. Everything in the shop had to look like it was manufactured and sold by the Weasley twins, and have a bit of backstory to it.\n\"It was a bit of a dream, really, to have six months to design a load of crazy packaging,\" Mina told INSIDER.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T17:35:35Z","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/harry-potter-jk-rowling-movie-secrets-facts-2017-7"}

{"text":"GENEVA, Mar 18 2013 (IPS) - The current growth model is not sustainable. Neither the green economy nor alternative sources of energy can prevent global warming. Solutions will come from concerted actions at the local and national levels, from the adoption of instruments and practices borrowed from other disciplines like peacebuilding, and from the move to a “no-waste economy”, according to experts here.\nIn its milestone report, “The Limits to Growth”, published in 1972, the Club of Rome warned that the human ecological footprint had grown dangerously quickly from 1900 to 1972. Shortly thereafter, the warning proved to be prophetic: by 1986 the human ecological footprint had overshot the carrying capacity of the Earth. At current production and consumption levels, we need 1.5 planets to survive; if everyone lived like a U.S. citizen, we would need five planets.\nLand, water and biodiversity continue to decline. Global CO2 emissions are on the rise. The oceans are warming and the sea level is rising continuously. Forest cover has decreased by 300 million hectares since 1990.\nIn his new book, “The Crisis of Global Sustainability”, presented in Geneva on Mar. 15, Tapio Kanninen, co-director of a project on sustainable global governance at the City University of New York and member of the Club of Rome, warms that we cannot continue with the current model of economic growth whilst limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius.\nTechnology cannot help us – it would be environmentally damaging and too costly, he says. We cannot move to alternative sources of energy – the present alternatives like solar, nuclear and wind contribute relatively little of global energy needs and they are unlikely to replace fossil fuel completely. In short: humanity has reached a stalemate.\n“Many U.N. summits after the (1987) Brundtland Commission have avoided concrete action,” Kanninen said at the book launch Friday.\nThe recent Rio+20 Earth Summit held in Brazil this past June is just one example of the limitations of these international gatherings. Though thousands of participants had hoped the conference would generate concrete solutions and commitments to reducing global warning, the concluding document made no mention of the 30-billion-dollar fund need to transition to a green economy, nor did it outline a blueprint for sustainable development post 2015.\nMost of these summits draw very high-level attendance, but in the end industrialised countries’ national interests dominate the bargaining universe. The global North wants to safeguard its neoliberal economic targets, while the South continues to defend its development goals.\nKanninen advocates for a second review conference of the U.N. charter and a complete paradigm shift.\nKanninen advocates abandoning the old approach of viewing sustainable development as a battlefield and adopting instead instruments from peace-building processes.\nYves Lador, consultant and representative of the U.S.-based Earthjustice at the U.N. in Geneva, told IPS on the sidelines of the book launch that this was an interesting approach.\n“Particularly (with regards) to climate change, we need some trust building measures inspired by the disarmament agreements”, through which governments allow outsiders to monitor their progress. He added that cross verification between different independent monitors could bolster the exercise.\n“This would be very useful because we don’t know the reality of various countries’ emissions. China, for example, does not make this data readily available. India has problems in data collection, but welcomes outside advice on how to share this data with the public.\nHe cited growing awareness of the link between climate change and human rights as a salient example of the right to information – namely, the right of the public to know the extent and impacts of climate change and to participate in decision-making.\nA circular economy is, by definition, a restorative economy: products should be designed for longer use and materials reused and recycled, which would increase the demand for maintenance and repairs. The concept has been around since the 1970s but it has gained momentum again due to the activities of the U.S.-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation and to “Bankrupting Nature”, a recent report authored by Ander Wijkman and Johan Rockström, co-president of the Club of Rome.\nHe believes an increase in services like leasing would compensate for the loss of jobs resulting from the decrease in production. Other major companies like Caterpillar have stopped selling huge trucks, and have begun to lease them.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T08:06:44Z","url":"http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/03/how-to-break-the-stalemate-on-global-sustainability/"}

{"text":"TURLOCK , Calif.--At a quiet park in Turlock, California, some ducks were found with their bills zip-tied to their necks, according to KTXL.\nDonnelly Park is a peaceful park in the middle of town. It's popular with families looking to spend some time by the water, under the trees.\nThe park is also home to several ducks.\nBut Sunday night, the ducks had something around their necks and Elizabeth Stevens took some pictures.\n\"I'm pretty sure someone did it to them, just how tight they were and how they were literally cut off as if someone tightened then and then cut it,\" Stevens said.\nThe zip ties were wrapped around the duck's neck, pinning its lower beak to its neck, its mouth open.

{"text":"The federal government is accelerating Canada’s transition to a lower-carbon economy, even as conservative politicians in the provinces vow to scuttle key measures that would support that effort.\nNatural Resources Minister Jim Carr endorsed an advisory council report Thursday that spells out an ambitious agenda of increasing energy efficiency, switching off fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country’s oil and gas industry.\nThe Generation Energy report was produced by an advisory committee appointed by Mr. Carr after he hosted a conference last year on the need for a new Canadian energy strategy. The committee included representatives from the oil and gas industry and the electricity sector, as well as from clean energy and Indigenous organizations.\nThe panel declared that climate change is a growing danger, and that Canada must be part of a global transition to lower-carbon energy needed to avert the most catastrophic impacts.\nHowever, there is considerable political opposition to the Liberal government’s climate-change approach. Conservative politicians argue that Ottawa and its allies among provincial governments are driving up energy costs for Canadians with carbon taxes while undermining the competitiveness of the domestic oil industry with levies and new regulations.\nDoug Ford will be sworn in as Ontario premier on Friday and has already said he will scrap the province’s cap-and-trade system that not only puts a levy on carbon emissions but finances programs to help homeowners and businesses reduce their energy use. Alberta’s United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney says he will move in a similar direction should he win an election scheduled for next spring.\nThe Generation Energy report is hardly a radical document; the panel’s co-chairs are Merran Smith, president of the advocacy group Clean Energy Canada, and Linda Coady, chief sustainability officer for pipeline and natural gas giant Enbridge Inc.\nThe report includes no call for Canada to rely solely on renewable energy by a certain date; there is no direct attack on the oil sands industry nor opposition to industry’s plan for three pipeline expansion projects that would increase volumes of Canadian crude to U.S. and offshore markets.\nHowever, it does lay out a daunting challenge for the country’s oil and gas sector, which suffered from the global price collapse of 2014-15 and is recovering far more slowly than some international competitors.\nThe goal, it said, is for the Canadian oil industry to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions on a per-barrel basis below that of major competitors, while also reducing costs. To get there, the industry will have to make massive investments in new technology and innovation.\nThat’s a tall order for oil sands companies whose production is among the most carbon intensive in the world, and whose cost structure is high. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers complained recently that climate and other environmental policies are placing an increasing burden on its members that make it difficult to attract investment.\nIn an interview, Mr. Carr said the Generation Energy panel’s conclusion are consistent with the Liberal government’s approach, which emphasizes action on climate change and providing incentives for Canadians to use less energy and lower-carbon energy, while supporting the traditional fossil fuel sector.\nConservative MP Ed Fast slammed the Liberals for undermining the oil and gas industry as it pursues its environmental agenda. “I find it appalling that the Liberals are taking reckless action that will only speed up the decline of the Canadian economy,” the Conservative environment critic said.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T20:59:58Z","url":"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-carbon-clash-trudeau-governments-plan-for-green-economy-meets/"}
{"text":"Page 11, 5 October 1878 — CRAFTSMEN IN FUR.\ncreations of fancy, and real in so many aspects, as the Pathfinder, as Leatherstockings, as La Longue Carabine ? Who has not Killdeer in an imaginary gun-rack, and, hanging on a peg in the store-house of memory, the blanket which the Delaware chief threw back, that he might display the tortoise on his breast to his ancient tribe ? Who has not seen, in air-drawn pictures, the cavern, with the sassafras screen, behind which the \" Palefaces\" lurked, while the deadly fight raged between the Mohicans and the Mingoes, who had \" dared to set the print of their mocassins in the woods \" that once owned the sway of the Delaware tribe ; the grave of Cora, beneath the young pines ; the dead Sagamore, attired in the full-dress of his tribe and rank, with the children of the Lenape listening for the lament from the stern old warrior, whose lips remain silent, as he looks his last on Uncas ? Do we altogether disbelieve in them, because a hundred writers have \" belittled \" the American Indians, and because modern followers of Fenimore Cooper in the frontier lands and on the path of the setting sun are merely animated by a spirit of butchery, and their records are usually lists of slaughter, whether of Indians, or of the animals that are being \"thinned out\" like them? No more than we altogether disbelieve in Man Friday, or accept special corre- spondents' accounts of Bagdad, in exchange for our own old notions of the glorified city where the hunchback lived who made that wonderful rally, after prolonged suffocation by a fishbone, which had such surprising results.\n\" The trees of many acres had been felled, and tho glow of a mild summer evening had fallen on the clearing, in beautiful contrast to the grey light of the forest. A short distance from the place whore Duncan stood, the stream had seemingly expanded into a little lake, covering most of the low land from mountain to mountain. The water foil ont of this wide basin in a cataract so regular and gentle that it appeared rather to be the work of human hands than fashioned by nature. A hundred earthen dwellings stood on the margin of the lake, and oven in its waters, as though the latter had overflowed its usual banks. Their rounded roofs, admirably moulded for defence against the weather, denoted more of industry and free-thought than the natives were wont to bestow on their regular habitations, much less on those they occupied for the temporary purposes of hunting and war The village appeared to be deserted, at least so Duncan thought for many minutes ; but at length ho fancied ho discovered several human forms advancing towards him on all-fours, and apparently dragging in their train some heavy and formidable engine. Just then a few dark-looking heads gleamed out of the dwellings, and the place Boomed suddenly alive with beings, which, however, glided from cover to cover so swiftly as to allow no opportunity of examining their humours or pursuits.\"\nthat shut it in, are fed by the everlasting snow, and in their turn feed the main river, broad, tortuous, and troubled, that cuts its way through the eastern boundary range by a deep oaten, and debouches by a cleft in the rocks, called \" The Gate of the Plains,\" into a vast open valley, which leads to the \"great American prairie.\" The banks of these streams are the still comparatively unmolested homes of the wonderful North-American beaver, of tribes of the strange creature who may be seen at his miniature industry in the Zoological Gardens, handling his invalu- able tail with incomparable skill, and presenting an absurd likeness to Cruikshank's Methodist parsons in the aspect of his damp and shiny bullet-head. Perhaps of all the captive creatures there, the beaver finds it hardest to reconcile himself to circum- stances, for his kind has a special and well founded abhorrence of man, so deep-rooted and so intelligent that the trapping of beaver, as a frontierman of great experience tells us, is a game of skill of the nicest description, and the faintest sus- picion of \" human taint\" upon the \"beaver medicine\" (its in- gredients are a secret) will disconcert the most careful arrange- ments, so that the trapper may as well move on at once .to a distant clime, for not only will he take no fur in the waters which the taint has touched, but the \" office\" will be given down stream. Mr. Campion was instructed in the art of beaver- trapping by the famous Captain John Connor, who is, notwith- standing his name, thoroughbred, and head chief of the Delaware Indians—the tribe of Chingachgook and Uncas—and he holds that as a sport it compares with every other field-sport, as chess does with most indoor games, combining the maximum of skill with the minimum of chance, for it is \" a con- test between acquired skill, knowledge, unremitting care and attention, and the natural instinct—if we may not call it reason —of the most sagacious, acute, and wary of all the brute creation.\"\nThe wariness of the object of their pursuit is a characteristic of the trappers also ; only after cautious observation has con- vinced them that the stranger is really one of the craft will they discuss its mysteries and requirements. Among the latter, am- phibiousness, or at least insensibility to every human ailment likely to be produced by wet and cold, seems to hold an important place. It is pleasanter to think of the wise and industrious creatures in the great solitudes, where no trapper has yet found them, if any such there be (and we believe there are, in the Alaska Territory, where the cold beats even the cupidity of the fur-bunter and the cruelty of the sportsman), where the deep waters and the impenetrable jungle on the river banks are all their own ; where unmolested they dam up their pools and build their houses, with winter bath-rooms, dwelling and store-rooms, and apartments appropriated to interesting events (which are frequent), without any risk of the head of the family coming home minus a hind or forepaw, left in a trap, according to the construction of the horrible instru- ment. Mr. Campion says the beaver is the only animal he is acquainted with who will amputate his own leg in order to escape from a trap ; but other frontiermen tell us that the wolverine exhibits similar sagacity and courage, when he gets into trouble. David Gamut was not annoyed by the sugges- tion of Hawkeye that the sweet singer had meditated teaching the canning beavers to sing to the praise and glory of God, but gravely opined that such intelligent creatures would be glad to thank their Creator, if they did but know how, for His gifts of skill and senses of scent and hearing so far beyond the human, even in a land where those senses are trained to their highest capacity, by constant need and ever present danger. We are reminded of David Gamut's notion, as we read of the beaver of Wet-Mountain Valley, of their spacious houses, with every convenience except air in them—how do the creatures live without it ?—which are entered by a round hole in the river bank a foot under water, with a vestibule varying from four to ten feet, leading to a circular basin four feet deep and of the same width, with a vaulted roof a foot above the level at which the water stands. \" This,\" Mr. Campion tells us, \"is the winter bath-room, its depth below the surface of the ground (the bank of the river being any number of feet high) and its distance back ensuring that the water in it will remain unfrozen.\" Surely the first man who violated the sanctity of a beaver's domicile by demolishing it from the top must have had some compunction, as well as much astonishment, awakened by the spectacle of the radiating passages and the admirably kept rooms in which the little family dwelt ! Surely he must have marvelled exceedingly at the stores of osier twigs, of the inner bark of cotton-wood trees, swamp maples, alders, and willows, cleanly cut, and neatly packed in the moist receptacle, where no frost could get at them, and the family food would remain fresh and tender until spring ! Mr. Campion tells us that the beaver is \" a good theoretical and practical engineer, who cuts down trees larger in proportion to his size than the greatest forest mammoths are to us, choosing them with great judgment, felling them to the exact spot required ; building dams capable of resisting mountain torrents, constructing dwellings showing some knowledge of hydrostatics, and not doing all these things invariably and always alike, as if instinctively only, but changing and adapting his ways and modes of proceeding according to the circumstances of each particular case.\" He is also a keen observer of his most suspected enemy, for an elaborately contrived scare- crow, made to imitate a man, and placed, club in hand, astride a ditch made by a party of diggers for mining purposes, and which took the water from a pool belonging to some beavers, so that it was lowered a few inches, failed to deter them from effectually damming the ditch. They simply pulled the dummy down, took his club from him, cut off his stone feet, floated him down the ditch to a spot where there was a short flume, stuffed him into it, middle first, tucked his head and legs into the corners, and plastered all the crevices up neatly with river-mud. Thus did the beavers \" outsmart\" the men, the beavers no doubt having a Havelock or a Wolseley for their leader, in that favoured portion of the wilderness. Mr. Campion has watched them making their wonderful dams—getting well out of scent, or they would have disappeared in an instant—and amazing as the whole process is, has been most puzzled to conceive how they can estimate the height of a standing tree, since they cannot climb, and the absence of stumps in the scene of their operations shows that they never cut down one which is too short to reach from bank to bank of the stream they mean to dam. Authority worthy of respect has said that the beaver does not use his tail as a trowel, but Mr. Campion opposes this statement with the testimony of his sight. \"Many times,\" he says, \"I have seen the unmistakable print of the beaver's tail on his mud-mortar.\" The construction of these wonderful dams varies in excellence ; there are beavers who scamp their work. Are there contract houses among them, and is their \" lath and plasture \" ever, like that of Miss Miggs's garret, warranted \"not to bear, but the contrairy ?\"\nThese clever, diligent, provident creatures are among the inno- cent and happy races of the animal world. The fierce beasts in the jungle on the river-banks may prowl over their hidden homes, but cannot harm them, and they harm no living thing. Their intense pleasure in the mysterious perfume which forms an in- gredient of the \" beaver medicine \" seems to be one of the cunning cruelties of Nature, like the attraction of the winged-insect tribes to the deadly flame. They are merry, too ; their system is not that of all work and no play (which seems to be a defect of the ant tribes, unless, indeed, it be applied exclusively to the servile races), and the human watcher, from a distance which renders the \" taint \" impossible, may see them, when the moonlight silvers the wastes and the waters, climbing out in groups upon the banks, chasing each other playfully, with funny antics, plunging, dipping, and splashing with their broad, flat tails ; laughing and talking, too, no doubt, after a fashion of their own, and knowing nothing of that which decrees that beaver bonnets shall \" come in\" again and sealskin jackets be trimmed with sleek, fine, beaver fur.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T14:24:19Z","url":"http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/5th-october-1878/11/craftsmen-in-fur"}
{"text":"Smartphones can play a very positive role as a new tool with ophthalmologists, shows a new study conducted by the Emory University.\nSmartphones can be extensively used by ophthalmologists for viewing complex inner eye photos for diagnostic purpose. They can also be used for taking, sending and viewing pictures of the damage to the front of the eye or eyelids.\nThe study was conducted among some 350 patients who reported issues like headaches, eyesight changes and similar vision problems in emergency rooms.\nThe study also included the inner-eye photos taken by the ER staff using an ocular camera.\nThen the study team assessed the response of two ophthalmologists who viewed and rated the pictures on a desktop PC and did the same on an iPhone.\nThe results of the study, published in the Archives of Ophthalmology, show that the doctors found the iPhone images good or better than desktop images and rated them high.\nWhile one ophthalmologist felt 53 pictures were of the same quality, he found 46 better on iPhone and just one was better on PC.\nFor the other ophthalmologist who participated in the study, 56 were of equal quality, while 42 were better on iPhone leaving only two better on PC.\nThe study team thinks that it is possible that smartphones can be used in ophthalmic treatment as a new tool with which hospital staff can send the photos from the ER to the doctor’s smartphone for consultation. And later maybe, somebody can make an app for that.\nThe team is planning to extend its study about this possibility.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T17:02:33Z","url":"http://www.devicemag.com/2012/07/12/smartphones-can-play-a-major-role-in-improving-ophthalmic-diagnosis-says-study/"}
{"text":"I love how old movies portray New York City at Christmastime. Snow drifts gently to the ground. Carols are sung on street corners. Decorations light up the streets. And the tree at Rockefeller Center seems to spread it's magic throughout the city, creating a scene straight out of the carol Silver Bells.\n“Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile.” I love how old movies portray New York City at Christmastime.\nBut I grew up in New York. And the city is nothing like that at Christmastime. The tree does light up Rockefeller Center and decorations line the streets. If you're lucky you'll get a nice snowfall. But what gives the city in those old films the spirit of Christmas is the people. The “children laughing” and the “smile after smile.” Ralph Kramden described it best in the Christmas episode of The Honeymooners, “everyone's hustling someplace. But they don't hustle around Christmastime like they usually do. You know they're a little more friendlier … they bump into you, they laugh and they say, 'Pardon me. Merry Christmas.'” It's a lovely idea but in reality New York is New York. You can put up the decorations, you can have a pretty snowfall, you can even put carolers on the streets. But everyone's still hustling just like they always hustle. And don't count on getting any Merry Christmases now – we're far too “tolerant” for that.\nSo I spend my Christmases at home with people who I can count on to be merry. And I look forward to the end of January when I will go to another city that I can count on to be filled with the Christmas spirit.\nThat city is Washington D.C. It's not the city itself that creates the Christmas feeling. I've been living in the area for a couple months now and I think it's safe to say that for 364 days of the year it's more or less the same as New York. But in the second to last week of January it is slowly imbued with a Christmas-like cheer, which typically reaches a crescendo on January 22.\nThis date is home to the annual March for Life, a rally comprising hundreds of thousands of people gathered to protest the killing of unborn children. It's a grave cause that brings us to Washington and so one might reasonably expect the gathering to be grave. But we have so many reasons for joy. We see that we are not alone. All year, on our own, we fight for life in the world – a cold, hard world which beats us down. But on this day we see that we are supported by hundreds of thousands of others, that we are never alone in this fight. And with each passing year we know that the institution of abortion is being chipped away until one day it will crumble before our eyes, as every other form of oppression, from Auschwitz to the Berlin Wall, has crumbled before it.\nBut the real source of our joy is that we are celebrating life! And this is what gives the March for Life that Christmas-in-New York feeling. Because what is Christmas but the celebration of life? It is the celebration of the birth of a child. It is the celebration of a woman in a difficult, unplanned pregnancy choosing life. And it is the celebration of the source of life coming into the world to restore life to fallen humanity.\nAt the March for Life we celebrate the birth of every child. We celebrate the courage of every woman who has chosen and will choose life. We celebrate the conversion and healing of every woman who stands at the front of the March proclaiming “I regret my abortion.” And at the heart of it all we simply celebrate the mind-boggling gift that is life itself.\nClare Hinshaw is a graduate of Franciscan University of Steubenville.

{"text":"Many people think the secret to great cooking is mastery of technique.\nIt helps, but it's hardly crucial. The key to cooking that tempts and satisfies, that brings people to the table, then brings them back for more, is understanding flavors and how they work together.\nAnd while a culinary degree certainly helps one understand this, more important is a willingness to try new foods, as well as old foods in new combinations. Now there is a book to help you take that flavorful trip.\nFlavor masters Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg have compiled an encyclopedic primer to flavor. Their just-released \"The Flavor Bible\" not only explains what foods taste like, it also offers exhaustive lists of flavor pairings for each.\nThey suggest mascarpone, for example, which goes nicely with almonds, ladyfingers and peaches, among many other options. They also suggest pairings to avoid, such as maple syrup and brown sugar (too intense).\nThe first two sections of the book explain how flavor works and offer advice from chefs and others about how they pair various flavors to create great recipes.\nIt's one of the rare cookbooks without recipes that everyone should learn to cook from.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T17:56:13Z","url":"https://www.newschief.com/news/20080910/pump-up-and-pair-up-the-flavor/1"}
{"text":"The trial of Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, on vague charges including espionage, began in Iran on Tuesday.\nOn Tuesday, the trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who has been imprisoned for nearly 10 months in Iran on vaguely defined charges, started in Tehran.\nAccording to Iran’s official news agency IRNA, Rezaian is accused of committing \"espionage for the hostile government of the United States\" and spreading anti-Iranian propaganda. Those charges had not been made public until last month, after Rezaian had already spent nine months in prison.\nThe 39-year-old correspondent was detained in late July of last year, along with his wife and two photojournalists. The other three were later released, but Rezaian has remained in Evin Prison, one of the country’s most notoriously inhumane facilities, and reportedly kept in isolation and denied medical treatment.\nThe Iranian government is presenting two pieces of evidence of espionage, Mr. Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, said: an American visa application for Yeganeh Salehi, Jason Rezaian’s wife, an Iranian citizen and a journalist, and a form letter sent by Mr. Rezaian to Barack Obama’s 2008 White House transition team offering help to improve relations between Iran and the United States.\nRezaian, who grew up in California and holds dual American-Iranian citizenship, was only allowed to meet with his lawyer once—she reportedly found out the date of the trial through Iranian media. If convicted, Rezaian could face up to 20 years in prison.\nBut one potentially telling detail about the otherwise mysterious proceedings is the judge assigned to the case. “The presiding judge, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences and is accused by human rights groups of cracking down on journalists and activists,” the BBC reported. “He has been dubbed the ‘judge of death’ for imposing several death sentences after the 2009 post-election opposition protests.” In 2011, Salavati was placed on a European Union blacklist for human-rights abuses, and last year, he was also accused of leading a crackdown on political activists and journalists within the country.\nAs the United States and Iran continue to pursue a nuclear deal, some have suggested that Iran could be using Rezaian as a bargaining chip to enhance its position in the negotiations.\nThroughout the nuclear talks, U.S. officials have frequently brought up Rezaian’s case as well as those of other American citizens currently being held in Iran. A number of Republican lawmakers have issued statements calling for the release of Rezaian as a precondition for a nuclear deal with Iran.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T23:05:15Z","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/a-closed-door-trial-in-tehran/394106/"}
{"text":"California is lifting its drought emergency for most of the state after a winter of record rain and snowfall that followed a five-year dry spell.\nGov. Jerry Brown's office announced Friday that his executive order will lift the drought emergency in California, except for Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne counties. Those counties still face groundwater supply shortages.\n\"This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,\" Gov. Brown said. \"Conservation must remain a way of life.\"\nBrown's office also said new legislation will create long-term conservation measures as the state with a history of dry spells anticipates future droughts.\nAbout 8 percent of California is still under some type of drought, according to the most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report. At this time last year, more than 90 percent of California fell into at least one of the weekly report's four drought categories.\nMore than 31 percent of California was in the most severe category -- exceptional drought -- in April 2016. That figure dwindled to 18 percent during the height of winter's storms before falling away later in the season.\nThe only parts of California that remain in moderate drought are northern Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Orange counties. A sliver of extreme southeastern Imperial County remains under severe drought.\nThe announcement ends the 2014 emergency declaration during California's driest four-year period on record. It led to the first conservation rules for the nation's most populated and agriculturally productive state, focused on turning off sprinklers and ripping out thirsty lawns.\nMonster storms this winter doused the Sierra Nevada Mountains with a record snowpack, a key California water source, and boosted reservoirs to normal levels. Melting water runs off the mountain and into a system of aqueducts and reservoirs, providing water for about 23 million Californians.\nWater conservation will become a way of life in the nation's most populated state, Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe.\n\"There's a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,\" she said. \"We've got to plan for longer droughts.\"\nCities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor order, which also bans wasteful practices. New rules are expected to permanently ban wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and watering landscapes in the days after it rains.\nSusan Atkins of the charity Self-Help Enterprises said the drought is not over for more than 900 families who have large water tanks in their yards because their wells dried up during the years long drought.\nMost of them are in Tulare County, a farming powerhouse in central California's San Joaquin Valley. Atkins said she still receives calls from people whose wells are running dry and need a tank and bottled water.\n\"In no way is it over,\" she said of the drought. \"We will run out of money before we run out of people that need help.\"\nAs for the robust snowpack, it might grow this weekend when an unusually strong spring storm sweeps through California. Electronic monitors last week showed the mountain snowpack was at 164 percent of normal.\nIt was the most dense springtime snowpack since 2011, a year followed by five years of drought.\nRecord-breaking rain in recent months has put a major dent in the drought but also led rivers and creeks to break their banks and wreaked havoc on the state's infrastructure. In February, drought busting storms led to an emergency evacuation of thousands of people downstream from Oroville Dam, where the main spillway broke apart and an emergency spillway eroded. In San Jose, thousands of residents were evacuated a flooded streets filled with mud and debris.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T22:49:19Z","url":"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/california/California-Drought-Emergency-Water-Conservation-418661303.html"}
{"text":"Okay, okay, so maybe Delly wouldn’t fall that far down the list. But still, a Matthew Dellavedova​ biopic? That seems…random. And yet, it’s apparently going to be real thing!\nAccording to Fox Sports Australia, Dellavedova and his Australian manager Bruce Kaider have teamed up with Los Angeles producers Zachary Green and Jason Shuman to create a film about Delly’s life. It will focus on his upbringing in Australia and lead right up into the present day, which has taken Dellavedova to the magical city of...Milwaukee. No, but seriously, Kaider is promising that there will be plenty of intriguing stops along the way.\n\"Delly’s inspirational story about overcoming the odds is one everyone can relate to,\" Kaider said in a press release, according to Fox Sports Australia. \"In real life, it played out just like a movie.\"\nDellavedova added that he’s looking forward to getting started on the film. \"I am honored that Bruce, Zachary, and Jason think enough about my journey to turn it into a feature film,\" he said. \"I am thrilled to be working with this incredible group to tell my story to inspire kids around the world to dream big and that hard work and perseverance pays off.\"\nThe press release about the biopic suggested the filmmakers are going to try and emulate movies like Hoosiers and Rocky when they create the film, which seems like it’ll be an impossible task. But then again, Delly is a guy who most people hadn&apos;t even heard of until 2015, and he somehow managed to finesse a four-year, $38 million contract this past offseason and now a movie about his life. So clearly, anything is possible!\nStay tuned for more details about the biopic.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T02:17:55Z","url":"https://www.complex.com/sports/2016/11/matthew-dellavedova-biopic-in-development"}

{"text":"History is filled with stories of bold pioneers who changed the world with their visionary ideas. There exists also, in the annals of innovation, a rich tradition of mad scientists with crazy inventions. These two notions are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many celebrated breakthroughs were initially met with scorn and ridicule. We've compiled 11 such world-famous ideas from the history of science and technology. The temptation, of course, is to include those ideas that were scorned and should have stayed scorned. The Star Wars prequels, say. But we're trying to run a classy operation here.\nHeliocentrism Galileo Galilei, sometimes called the Father of Modern Science, was among the first and most famous to pay a price for his crazy scientific ideas. Galileo publicly promoted the Copernican concept of heliocentrism -- that the Earth revolves around the Sun -- back when the Church and even most fellow mathematicians held to geocentric model. Unfortunately, in 17th century Rome, such radical ideas were quite literally heresy. Galileo was forced to recant and spend the rest of his life under house arrest.\nTelephone The question of who actually invented the telephone has inspired a small library full of academic research. But at least one of the earliest telephone prototypes was met with official scorn. In 1860, a full 16 years before Alexander Graham Bell's patent, German schoolmaster Johann Phillip Reis constructed a prototype \"telephon\" and sent the details to a prominent scientific journal. The editors scoffed at the idea of telephonic transmission and Reis' paper was rejected out of hand. Evidence of Reis' work was later suppressed during the telephone patent wars of the 1870s.\nAlternating current As the Reis incident suggests, sometimes public reaction to a new idea is influenced by the competition. In the 1880s, lawmakers and the general public literally feared the use of alternating current (AC) for electric power distribution. AC power was considered dangerous, largely due to an orchestrated public relations campaign by Thomas Edison, who had financial interests in the competing direct current (DC) model. Edison even went so far as to stage public electrocutions of animals to freak people out about alternating current. These demonstrations later led to the invention of the electric chair.\nRadio The Top 40 anthem \"We Built This City\" -- generally considered the worst song ever -- name-drops Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian engineer often credited as the inventor of modern radio. Marconi didn't invent radio at all, actually. Scientists had been tinkering with the tech for years. But Marconi did champion the idea that long-distance radio transmissions could have profound cultural and commercial applications -- adult contemporary rock, for instance. Nevertheless, Marconi's vision was unappreciated at the time. In 1895, Italian officials routed his request for funding to the local insane asylum.\nVelcro In 1941, Swiss engineer George de Mestral was taking his dog for a walk when he began to wonder about those irritating burrs that tend to stick to your clothes (or your dog) on a hike. Being an engineer, de Mestral grabbed a microscope and the rest is history. His idea for a hook-and-loop fastener, now known as Velcro, was initially met with condescending skepticism by the European fabric industry. And as we all know, there are few entities more intractable than the European fabric industry. It took another 14 years to patent the \"zipperless zipper\" and in 1999, de Mestral was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame.\nPersonal computer It's hard to even wrap your head around now, but there was a time when the computer was viewed as an unknowable egghead machine with limited practical applicability for the common man -- like the electron microscope or the supercollider. The idea of a personal computer was crazy even to those in the business. \"I think there is a worldwide market for maybe five computers,\" said IBM chairman Thomas J. Watson in 1943. Supposedly. There's some debate over the veracity of this quote, but it does reflect the prevailing attitude of the time.\nCompact discs In the late 1970s, heavyweight competitors Sony and Philips worked together to develop the Compact Disc (CD) format, soon to revolutionize sound recording and distribution. Their biggest obstacle? A profoundly skeptical music industry, who insisted digital would never replace analog technologies like vinyl and cassette. Sony chairman Norio Ohga basically staked his career on the CD format. A classical music connoisseur, Ohga trusted his ear and promoted the CD's superior sound quality. Five years after debuting in Japan, the CD overtook the vinyl LP in total record sales.\nQuasicrystals Good ideas are sometimes dismissed at the molecular level. When famed Israeli scientist Dan Shechtman discovered quasicrystals in the 1980s, he was mocked and kicked off his own research team. Said one competing researcher: \"There is no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists.\" Not a bad line, really, but Shechtman was vindicated rather spectacularly with a Nobel Prize in 2011. The discovery of quasicrystals changed ideas about the very structure of matter and now represents an entire field of study in materials science. Oh, and Schechtman just announced plans to run for the Israeli presidency.\nIphone and iPad Apple's triumphs in recent years have been so dazzling that its easy to forget the skepticism that preceded the company's flagship mobile products. Tech pundits and (especially) mobile phone executives ridiculed the iPhone concept of an all-in-one device in 2007. Even Apple's traditional rival got in on the action: \"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,\" said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in 2007. And remember the incessant jokes about the iPad's name back in 2010? Some joke: The iPad pretty much single-handedly resurrected the tablet as a viable mobile device.\nWearables History tends to repeat itself, so the obvious question is this: Which dubious technology of today will become the breakthrough of tomorrow? You can find plenty of skeptics dismissing the idea of wearables, always-on computing devices such as the smartwatch or Google Glass. Detractors can point to long list of failures in the wearable computing arena. But who knows? Perhaps our future cybernetic overlords will look back 100 years from now and regard wearables with digital fondness -- the breakthrough that sparked the inevitable robot revolution. Only time will tell.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T14:55:18Z","url":"https://www.arnnet.com.au/slideshow/538664/pictures-crazy-it-just-might-work/"}
{"text":"As I alluded to previously, immigration reform seems to me like an issue where radical tactics, if people could be organized to engage in them, would have high prospects for success. Among other things, Jose Antonio Vargas’ story today makes that clear on a number of levels.\nOne is that people were willing to help him in a civilly disobedient way, starting with the woman at the DMV who whispered to him that his papers were fake rather than reporting him. Another is that whatever ultimately happens to Vargas, INS agents haven’t rushed to his house to deport him ASAP. He’s not currently sitting in a detention cell being questioned about what knowledge editors at the Washington Post and Huffington Post had of his immigration status. When Vargas pitched the story to the Post, they apparently rejected it, but they didn’t turn around and immediately drop a dime on the guy.\nWhich is all just to say that the treatment of undocumented workers in this country is one of those things where we’re only kinda sorta willing to enforce the law. Faced with a known quantity — a friend, a colleague — nobody really wants to see a good person deported. Nobody really wants to make powerful people pay the price for complying with the law. And everyone knows we wouldn’t really even have the logistical capacity to deport every unauthorized migrant in the United States if they all turned themselves in tomorrow. The undocumented and their friends and family and allies have, in other words, the potential to take the broken immigration and really smash it the point where it doesn’t work at all. What the practical output of a crisis like that would be is difficult to say. But the point is that Washington basically doesn’t want this on the agenda. Politicians want to talk about deficit reduction and posture about jobs. But undocumented people could in principle force their way onto the agenda if there was enough will and organization. And I think the experience of the filibuster-happy 111th Congress makes it pretty clear that if we are going to see dramatic legislative change on this front it’s going to take something like that.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T10:39:14Z","url":"https://thinkprogress.org/direct-action-and-immigration-reform-38cebe42453/"}

{"text":"IF you like cricket, and like a brainy writer whose intellectualism is friendly and endearing, you’d better read this book. Mike Brearley was a cricketer with modest abilities, but he possesses a beautiful mind. Most creditably, excelling in cricket and studies at Cambridge didn’t make him insufferable. His mind has trumped his batting feats, which are nondescript — 1,952 international runs at an average of 23.23. But he is extraordinarily cerebral, and it’s primarily due to this that he played 64 international matches, of which he captained in 56. His brain kept him in the team; if not captaining, he wouldn’t have been in the team for so long. His leadership qualities were exceptional, his man management top-drawer — post-cricket, he became a psychoanalyst.\nBrearley remains acutely aware of his limitations as a player, as is most evident in the chapter on Viv Richards, the original King. Brearley writes with breathlessness and incredulity that Richards treated him as his peer. We all know Richards had and has no peers, and Brearley knows it too. Richards has respect for the intellect of Brearley. As a force for positive change in cricket, Brearley’s intellect is respected and can be useful, which Richards recognises. Brearley is left awed by the encounter. ‘I want him to like me,’ he writes. ‘I am almost surprised he remembers me, that he wants to talk to me. But I don’t feel relaxed. I don’t easily take in what he is saying. I have to listen hard. He is, as my colleague John Stephenson, also present, said afterwards, an alpha male. One can’t imagine a woman not being fascinated. As a man (am I one?), older, in every sense paler, I am charmed, but also a tad intimidated, even by his friendliness.’ Considering Brearley’s high intellect, this extreme modesty seems unreal, artificial. But it’s not fake, for Brearley is a very sincere, earnest man.\nBrearley is perhaps less intimidated when it comes to, say, invoking Socrates when discussing the aesthetics of the game.\nIn short, Brearley resides as easily on the intellectual plane of the sport as on the physical one.\nBrearley wears his intellectualism lightly. A few years ago, as we discussed depression among cricketers, he prefaced almost every sentence with ‘I think’, ‘perhaps’ or ‘probably’. When he speaks, he leaves room for a contrary or dissenting view, that’s the generosity of his spirit. Doubt isn’t necessarily a bad attribute.\nHe writes, too, with self-effacing simplicity, having a wry laugh at himself every now and then. Any traces of immodesty he might have had were summarily crushed by his father when he was a teenager, as he relates: ‘I had been both arrogant and falsely modest, commenting to Mike Griffith and my father that my wicket-keeping was ‘not quite as good as Mike’s on the leg-side.’ His father told him off, ‘quietly’. ‘I felt and can still feel the shame,’ Brearley writes. No wonder Brearley, 60 years on, is touched when the great Viv Richards doesn’t fail to add ‘I think’ after expressing an opinion to him.\nThis book is valuable for several reasons. One reason is that it’s full of anecdotes and contains affectionate and kind portraits of great players such as Bishan Singh Bedi, Sarfraz Nawaz, Richards, Dennis Lillee and Michael Holding. A more important reason is that it provides terrific food for thought, and can help one get a perspective on something important such as, say, racism.\nAbove all is Brearley’s ability to put himself in someone else’s shoes — and, more particularly, head. As a philosopher-cricketer, that’s his greatest gift.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T12:34:59Z","url":"https://m.tribuneindia.com/article/news-detail/723040/amp"}
{"text":"September 2,2008: Hamas has an image problem, and it's getting worse. It's gotten so bad that the 30 year old son (Mosab Yousef) of one of the Hamas founders (Hassan Yousef) has not only renounced Hamas, but has become a Christian. Mosab is fed up with the terrorism/\"destroy Israel\" approach the Arab world has embraced over the last sixty years. Mosad notes, as have many other Arabs, that this has not worked.\nThe conversion angle is something Moslems are trying to keep quiet. Mosab Yousef's father pleaded with his son to keep quiet about the conversion (which took place 18 months ago). The elder Yousef knows that this is not an isolated incident. Many young Moslems are abandoning Islam. Most do so quietly. In Iran, the clerics that run the country are shocked at secret police reports about a growing number of young Iranians who have, in effect, abandoned Islam. This sort of thing is happening all over the Moslem world, but especially in Arab countries. The people who switch to Islamic radicalism get all the headlines, not the larger numbers who just walk away from Islam are largely ignored. In the Palestinian territories, there is also a growth in the number of Sunni Moslems who are switching to the Shia version (as championed by Iran). But many other Moslems are openly distancing themselves from the conservative forms of Islam (like the well funded Saudi Wahhabism). One reason this trend is kept quiet is because Islamic militants are inclined to kill such traitors, if the switch is done too openly. Thus the elder Yousef's plea that his son keep quiet, lest he attract the murderous attention of Islamic radicals out to impose the death sentence on apostates.\nHamas was founded in 1987, as one of the Palestinian terrorist organizations that believed attacking Israeli civilians was the way to victory. Hamas also noted (based on what happened to most of the first generation Palestinian terrorist organizations of the 1960s) that they needed more than violence to survive. So they sought out Moslem charities for donations, and ran many humanitarian programs. Once they had a steady stream of charity money coming in, they could divert some of it to terrorist activities. None of this worked. Israel defeated Hamas terrorism efforts twice (early 1990s, then once more a decade later). When Hamas won the Palestinian elections in 2006, and refused to drop its demand for the destruction of Israel (as non-Moslem donors, who provided most of the charitable contributions that kept the Palestinian state going, insisted), money dried up and the Palestinian government split into Hamas in Gaza (with 1.4 million people) and Fatah in the West Bank (with 2.4 million people). The Palestinians have managed to compile an impressive string of failures in the last half century, and many Palestinians are beginning to question the leadership and strategy.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T18:18:30Z","url":"https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htterr/articles/20080902.aspx"}

You probably have read it all on Facebook and in newspapers, and have seen it in the news the last few days.\nWhat I remember most about President Bush is that he was a decent man.\nIt’s not an exaggeration to say this holiday season is quite a stretch.\nObviously, he loved his dear wife Barbara from the day they met until his last breath. Even in the height of power as leader of the free world, he would exercise decency and was a true gentleman.\nI remember the victory in the first Gulf War, and how he built the large coalition of countries from around the world to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. It was possible, in part, because of the relationships he had built over years public service.\nOne of the small things President Bush was known for was making you feel special when you were in his presence, no matter your place on the social or economic scale.\nAnother was his note writing. He would spend hours sending handwritten personal notes to those he met. From world leaders to a 6-year-old visitor to the White House, he made a point to connect with you.\nHarford County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Sean Bulson has said on several occasions that the safety, security and mental well-being of the 38,000 HCPS students and 5,000 employees is his and the community’s first priority. He said so again during a budget work session Tuesday evening.\nOn his last day in office as the most powerful man in the world, President Bush left a note to Bill Clinton, the man who after a brutal election had defeated beat him, removing him from office.\nThe note ends with: “You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country’s success.\nI personally don’t believe decency died with President George H.W. Bush.

{"text":"Content protection features in Windows Vista are preventing customers from playing high-quality video and audio and harming system performance, even as Microsoft neglects security programs that could protect users, computer researcher Peter Gutmann argued at the USENIX Security Symposium in Boston Wednesday.\n\"If there was any threat modeling at all, it was really badly done,\" Gutmann, from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said while giving a talk on Vista content protection. \"Once the enemy is the user and not the attacker, standard security thinking falls apart.\"\nVista requires premium content like high-definition movies to be degraded in quality when sent to high-quality outputs, so users are seeing status codes that say \"graphics OPM resolution too high.\" Gutmann calls this \"probably the most bizarre status code ever.\"\nWhile Microsoft's intent is to protect commercial content, home movies are increasingly being shot in high definition, Gutmann said. Many users are finding they can't play any content if it's considered \"premium.\"\n\"This is not commercial HD content being blocked, this is the users' own content,\" Gutmann said. \"The more premium content you have, the more output is disabled.\"\nGutmann, who wore a white T-shirt marked with a Windows Vista logo during his presentation, first issued his criticisms several months ago with a paper titled A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection.\nGutmann's paper called Vista's content protection rules \"the longest suicide note in history.\"\nMicrosoft acknowledged that quality of premium content would be lowered if requested by copyright holders, the BBC reported. Microsoft defended its copyright protections after Gutmann's paper came out, saying they are common features of many playback devices, the BBC article says.\nThe protections allow copyright holders to prevent video from being played in high definition unless users have equipment that supports the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) digital rights management system developed by Intel. If PC users have graphics cards with video connections that don't support HDCP, they are out of luck.\nHigh-definition audio is also blocked in many cases, Gutmann said Wednesday.\n\"It's taking this open architecture that IBM created 25 years ago and making it closed again,\" he said.\nIn a 132-slide PowerPoint presentation, Gutmann outlined numerous features of Vista that he says are frustrating customers and programmers. New functionality related to content protection makes it hard to develop new drivers, he said. When ATI was finally able to ship Vista drivers, they crashed Windows, and Dell and Gateway had to delay Vista upgrades because they couldn't get working drivers, he said.\nGutmann said hardware costs will increase because vendors can't provide Vista-approved security functionality unless Hollywood studios like MGM, 20th Century Fox and Disney grant written approval saying the content security meets their standards.\nA Vista function known as \"tilt bits\" -- like the tilt sensor in pinball machines -- requires hardware and software drivers to report every minor glitch, even ones that cause no problems, Gutmann said.\n\"Every otherwise unnoticeable minor glitch is suddenly surfaced and turned into a showstopper,\" he said.\nSeparately, all the extra encryption required to meet Vista's content protection standards means some computer components can never enter power-saving mode, he said. Thus, when you play a movie your CPU keeps running at full steam, he said. The extra power demands make it hard to reduce electricity usage.\n\"It's a bit of an extreme claim, but you could say Windows Vista causes global warming, because it's burning so much power with all this nonsense,\" Gutmann said.\nThe encryption requirements render high-end graphics processing units less effective, he said, because the best of those products emphasize graphics performance over content protection. On Vista, US$100-video cards can thus outperform those that cost $1,000.\nGutmann argued that Microsoft placed content protection above all other priorities when building Vista, perhaps to gain favor and money from Hollywood. Microsoft should have instead focused this effort on security features that protect users, Gutmann said, such as encrypted paging to protect user secrets, protected content domains that keep out malware, and anti-debugging techniques to prevent rootkit hooking.\nNew Zealand's government, which has argued that digital rights management fails to address the rights of people and government, appears to be the only government worldwide to express public concern about Vista's content protection standards, Gutmann said.\nThis story, \"Vista Prevents Users From Playing High-Def Content\" was originally published by Network World.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T15:01:04Z","url":"https://www.pcworld.com/article/135814/article.html"}
{"text":"Assures reporters will not be blocked from covering Asean summit in Vientiane.\nLaos yesterday defended its latest regulations imposed on foreign journalists, saying it would not prevent foreign media from covering the 2016 Asean due to be hosted in Vientiane.\n“We don’t have restrictions but procedures, the procedures that other countries also have to ensure national security,” said Laos’ Information, Culture and Tourism Vice Minister and Lao Journalists Association (LJA) president Savankhone Razmountry.\nThe new rules came into effect in January 14 and require foreign media to submit its coverage to the Lao government for screening before publishing, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand.\nHowever, foreign journalists who cover the Asean Summit in November will not have to do so, said Vorasack Pravongviengkham, deputy director general of Lao National Radio (LNR).\n“Only those who come to film or cover documentaries are required [to submit their coverage],” said Vorasack. To cover Asean Summits in Lao, foreign journalists are expected to go through government procedures and be escorted by its officers, according to Savankhone.\nVisiting journalists have to declare lists of questions and topics for their coverage to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lao PDR, he said.\nThe country has a mechanism to deal with visiting journalists, including state agencies, the Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, embassies and also the LJA, he said, without mentioning how it operates.\n“There will not be any problems for the foreign media to cover this news in Lao,” stressed Savankhone.\nHe was speaking at a seminar entitled “Laos as host of Asean” hosted by the Thai Journalists Association (TJA). LJA has been visiting Thailand to strengthen ties between Thai and Lao journalists and create better understanding among each other to ensure smooth cooperation in Asean.\nMeanwhile, Vorasack said that Lao media usually takes time to ensure news accuracy before publishing. It does not attempt to conceal facts, he said, referring to two cases in March when Chinese tourists were ambushed, leaving nine injured and one dead. TJA and LJA have for decades had close ties – but there were certain different points of view, said TAJ president Wanchai Wongmeechai, and it was important to learn from each other.\nDuring the seminar, TJA adviser and senior correspondent Kavi Chongkittavorn pointed out the challenges that Laos would face when holding an Asean summit. He said ‘big brothers’ – the United States and China – also had ambitions to play an important role in the Asean community.\nKavi emphasised Laos success as the host of Asean. It was shown in its courage to help ease international issues such as those of the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea conflict, and its sincerity in following the Asean charter.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T08:35:22Z","url":"http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Laos-defends-curbs-foreign-media-30283442.html"}

{"text":"Jalapenos are used in many spicy dishes and used fresh, dried eaten pickled.\nJalapeno peppers are among the warm-season hot peppers of the Solanaceae family. Hot peppers, like jalapenos, need a long, warm growing season and grow best when planted outdoors as seedlings. You can enjoy fresh peppers or grow them to dry and use in your favorite dishes even if you do not have room for an outdoor garden. You can grow jalapenos in containers indoors and outdoors or grow them hydroponically.\nYou can grow jalapenos outdoors, starting two to three weeks after the last spring frost. Jalapenos require full sun, which is at least six hours of sun daily, and well-drained soil amended with organic matter. The proper pH level for jalapenos is 6.0 to 6.8, so to adjust, add limestone if the pH is low and peat moss if it is higher than 6.8. Sow jalapeno seeds 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep and space seeds or transplants 18 to 24 inches apart with two to three feet between rows. Water regularly to keep peppers evenly moist.\nJalapenos grow well in large containers if you don't have space in your yard. You need a large container, with a capacity of about 2 to 3 gallons. To successfully grow peppers in a container, they still need enough sunlight and proper care. You can use an all-purpose potting mix, but container plants still require more fertilizer and careful watering. Use a liquid fertilizer once a week and water the container to keep the soil moist. Put the container jalapenos where they will get at least six hours of sun a day.\nYou can grow jalapenos indoors hydroponically using a simple deep-water culture set-up. Peppers grow well with ebb and flow system along with rockwool slabs as a growing medium. Because pepper plants grow tall, they will need support to keep them from falling over. When grown hydroponically, the correct nutrient solution is important, so if you're new to hydroponics, it might be better to use a premixed solution.\nVegetables that grow well together in containers save space while still giving you variety. You can plant vegetables, such as jalapeno peppers, tomatoes and herbs together in one container, making it easy to grow ingredients for your favorite dishes or your favorite herbs for flavoring foods. When growing vegetables all in one container, give each plant plenty of room and leave enough space to accommodate plant growth. Simply fill a container with fresh potting mix, plant the vegetables, water and place in a sunny location. Always use a container with drainage holes.\nAllman, Molly. \"Ways to Grow Jalapenos.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/ways-grow-jalapenos-45100.html.

{"text":"HELENA – A state panel heard four hours of testimony Wednesday on bills relating to missing and murdered Indigenous women, an issue that proponents said affect all Montanans, but could have a profound impact on the Native American community.\nHouse Bill 21, known as “Hanna’s Act,” authorizes the department of justice to hire a missing persons specialist to work with local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement authorities on missing persons cases.\nThe specialist will help law enforcement and families in the search for missing persons, oversee entries into the database of the national crime information center of the U.S. Department of Justice and other databases to ensure records of missing persons are accurate, complete, and made in a timely fashion.\nHowever, they also noted it was not just a problem on reservations but statewide as well.\nThe bill, which would appropriate $100,000 to the general fund for each year of the biennium, would become effective July 1. The House Judiciary Committee heard the bill, along with three others Wednesday, but only took testimony.\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Rae Peppers, D-Lame Deer, is in remembrance of Hanna Harris, a Lame Deer woman killed in 2013 on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.\nHer mother, Malinda Harris Limberhand, was among those who spoke to the committee, not only about HB 21 but on HB 54 as well, which requests all law enforcement agencies to immediately accept a report of a missing person unless there are extenuating circumstances.\nShe said she reported her daughter missing and was told by the police chief she was probably partying.\n“To this date I don‘t think she was ever put into a data base for missing persons,” Limberhand said.\nBryan Lockerby, division administrator for Montana Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation, said HB 54 provides help when issues about jurisdiction arise.\n“This is about closing loopholes and closing gaps and finding them in the system and getting them shut down,” he said.\nA long line of people testified Wednesday on the four bills before the House Judiciary Committee, many of them becoming emotional.\nOther bills discussed included HB 40, creating the reentry cultural programming grant program and HB 48 to provide stacking of tribal court convictions for partner or family assault.\nThe hearing was capped by a rally in the rotunda of the Capitol and a news conference in the governor’s reception room.\nGov. Steve Bullock called missing and murdered indigenous women an \"epidemic.\"\nHe said that nearly half the missing people cases in Montana are Native women. He said in 2013 there were 30 Native missing or murdered women in Montana.\n\"These are real lives and real people and for every single person going missing or murdered it has a ripple effect\" on the lives of others.\nHe said lawmakers have a moral obligation to deal with the issues.\n\"Never doubt the power of your voices,” he said.\nPeppers said the lives and safety of Native women cannot be put on the back burner any longer.\n“Too many of our sisters, mothers, and daughters have been left behind by our legal system,” she said.\nPeppers said the people who testified Wednesday are seeking justice.\n“They are asking for answers,” she said, adding that law enforcement does not take their losses seriously.\nRep. Casey Schreiner, D-Great Falls, the House minority leader, said the “epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women could not be more urgent.\n“Getting justice for these missing Montanans and their families is one of our top priorities. Democrats in the Legislature will not stop working until we get these bills across the finish line and deliver on our promises to Indian Country,” he said.\nPeppers and others throughout the day said it wasn’t just an Indian Country problem, this is a Montana problem.\nRep. Sharon Stewart Peregoy, D-Crow Nation, said hearing the testimony was difficult.\nU.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., recently wrote a letter to the FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs criticizing the handling of the case of 14-year-old Henny Scott of Lame Deer, who was found murdered in December. It took 13 days for law enforcement to notify the public that a missing persons report had been filed.\nOn Jan. 18, the House passed House Bill 20, that allows any law enforcement officer in the state to file a missing child report as soon as a child is reported missing.\nIt passed the House 97-0 on Jan. 21 and awaits a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThese bills come as a record number of Native lawmakers are serving in Montana’s Legislature this session, with the Montana American Indian Caucus having 11 tribal members, roughly 7 percent of the Legislature.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T10:00:16Z","url":"https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2019/01/30/montana-panel-hears-bills-related-murdered-missing-indigenous-women/2720359002/"}

{"text":"Mismanagement and secrecy have stalled the war on terrorism—and at home its effects reverberate against civil rights.\nIf September 11 was this generation's Pearl Harbor, the Bush Administration's war on terrorism is still in early 1942, when the news from the front was bad, and the home front was panicky and confused. Now the instant-gratification warriors of the press are rushing in to turn things around. Columnists William Kristol and Charles Krauthammer grumble that the Administration is operating under too many constraints. Impatience with the air campaign has sparked calls by the Sunday morning punditocracy to send in substantial ground troops beyond the small contingent already there. Senator John McCain calls for B-52 carpet-bombing. Polls show a rising number of Americans doubt the war on terrorism will succeed.\nOur concern is less about fine points of military strategy than about the possibility that the human and political costs of the war might outweigh any gains in national security and undermine America's moral credibility in the fight against the perpetrators of September 11. The bombing campaign may or may not be militarily effective–who knows, since our only information comes from the Pentagon and Al Jazeera–but civilian casualties are eroding support among coalition allies. TV pictures of devastated neighborhoods and wounded civilians fuel anger against America throughout the Arab and Muslim world and provide rallying cries for extremists, who could destabilize fragile governments in Pakistan, Indonesia and elsewhere. Sketchy reports from inside Afghanistan suggest that the bombing is turning people's loyalty back to the Taliban–making more difficult any covert operations aimed at capturing the \"Evil One.\" It has sent waves of humanity to huddle on Pakistan's closed borders. As winter sets in, as many as 5 million face dire food shortages.\nAt home, Congress passes a counterterrorism bill \"without deliberation and debate,\" according to Senator Russ Feingold, the lone senator who cast a historic vote against the ill-named PATRIOT Act. The act grants the Feds sweeping powers that break down the firewall between intelligence-gathering and criminal justice. Nothing in the bill would have prevented the disaster of September 11. And yet Bush and House GOP leaders still balk at passing the one measure that could have: federalizing airport security. Meanwhile, the Justice Department continues to resist legitimate requests for information about the 1,107 people it has detained in connection with the September 11 attacks. Civil liberties organizations and others, including this magazine, have filed a Freedom of Information Act request for information about those detained, warning that the government's \"official silence prevents any democratic oversight of [its] response to the attacks.\" The government should comply.\nUltimately, the antiterrorism campaign could have disastrous consequences if America alienates its allies abroad and its people at home. The United States must reassure–by words and deeds–the majority of Muslims who oppose the terrorist attacks that the purpose of US military action is not to punish Afghans for the actions of Osama bin Laden. To this end, it should work more closely with the United Nations by curtailing military actions that hamper relief activities and by supporting UN efforts to build a coalition government that represents all parties in Afghanistan.\nPolls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans favor a multilateral effort against terrorists, including working through the UN. Add to this stepped-up international policing efforts that must be the backbone of any global antiterrorism campaign and financial countermeasures that target identifiable terrorist groups. As Jonathan Schell writes on page 8, \"In a war on terrorism–as distinct from a war on a state–it is politics, not military force, that will probably decide the outcome.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:13:10Z","url":"https://www.thenation.com/article/war-measured/"}

However, the last time I was incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities, it took 20 years to realize them,” De Taeye said.\nNokia is already betting on GPS-enabled phones and most top handset suppliers are expected to come out with models soon, though Flint gave no date for when Sony Ericsson would start building GPS into its phones.\nThe first selling point for GPS phones is as a tool for users to find their way around, but many believe the social networking similar to that helped by MySpace, Facebook and Flickr Web sites is what will deliver mass appeal.\nAn Amsterdam company, recently acquired by small Finnish mobile phone maker Benefon, is currently building a social networking application for GPS-enabled phones.\nThe service, branded GyPSii, will allow users to upload pictures, videos and sound clips recorded with their phones that are automatically encoded with the location where the picture was taken or the recording was made.\nUsers can see where their friends are and see and search each other’s saved places.\nThe company’s founders, Dan Harple and Sam Critchley, believe that eventually, these place marks will grow into a database that will deliver more relevant search results because the company also records data on who submits what and when.\nA 40-year old man searching on a Wednesday evening for a place to meet friends for drinks might get different results to a 16-year-old girl doing the same search on a Saturday night.\nSitting on board a canal boat in Amsterdam, Harple said the venture was not exactly of a scale that was likely to bring down Google.\n“But we will deliver a different type of search results. We’re not just crawling the web, content is being pushed from the ground up,” he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T14:38:06Z","url":"https://uk.reuters.com/article/specialeventii-summit-satnav-phones-dc/positioning-phones-to-create-new-social-networks-idUKL1763708820070517"}
{"text":"Thanks to Meghan Markle, black pants are no surprise on a royal outing — but when Kate Middleton decided to opt for the look, we had to do a double take. On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate's outfit — as well as a few of the times Meghan's worn this kind of ensemble — then shop similar pieces to re-create the look for yourself.

{"text":"A key provision in the 1997 accord between the county and Basketball Properties Ltd., the Heat’s operating arm, stipulates that Miami-Dade is to receive 40 cents of every dollar of profit after the team earns $14 million in profits. Yet, 15 years into the deal — even after a 2006 world championship and nearly two years with league Most Valuable Player LeBron James — the Heat maintains it has never come close to that magic number.\nThat’s because despite some profitable years, the contract allows the Heat to pay off all of its losses before declaring profitability. The team reported losses totaling $156.6 million through 2010.\nDespite James’ presence, a $13 million windfall from increased ticket sales, a giant spike in food and drink concessions last year, and $72.2 million the county poured into operating the arena, the Heat remains well below the threshold of sharing profits with Miami-Dade.\n“The county has little idea of the underlying conditions and financial issues that, to date, have resulted in the Arena’s failure to generate sufficient reportable net cash flow that would have allowed the county to share in the distribution of Arena excess cash flow,” the audit stated.\nThe county administration, in a statement Thursday afternoon, said it is improving managerial oversight of the arena agreement.\nGimenez said his office is consulting with the county attorney and will issue a status report within 90 days as requested by the inspector general.\nMazzella said the county must familiarize itself with the Heat’s complex finances and review the team’s capital budgets, including how much the Heat spends on equipment leases such as those for LED screens and monitors. The county, as the owner of the arena, should also be notified of lawsuits filed against the Heat.\nThe inspector general suggested the county learn how the team makes money from lucrative concessions and “premium” ticket sales, including suites. Also, the county should know more about non-basketball events at the arena, since those revenues impact potential profits, he wrote.\nMazzella also criticized the Heat, questioning $3.3 million the team spent on capital improvements. He said that money should have gone toward negating losses instead.\nAnd Mazzella questioned certain Heat expenditures, including $12,300 spent on political contributions and $614,000 on lobbyists. The Heat said $10,000 went to a National Conference of Mayors convention in Miami, presided over by former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz.\nLopez, the Heat’s lobbyist who earned a large chunk of the $614,000 in question, called all of the team’s expenses “legitimate” and said the Heat will work harder to get its budgets to the county on time.\nEric Woolworth, president of the Heat Group’s business operations, said in a statement that the audit failed to recognize the successes of the partnership between the Heat and the county — especially the revitalization of downtown Miami — and that it gave “short shrift on the risk” the company took in undertaking construction.\nWoolworth also said Mazzella misinterpreted provisions of the agreement relating to capital expenditures and business expenses.\nThe Heat played its first game at the AAA in 2000, after a dozen years at the old Miami Arena in Overtown. Blessed with fan and corporate support, the team pined for the millions in new revenue anticipated from the sales of expensive suites, exclusive seats and high-end retail at the new arena.\nBroward County offered a better financial deal for the team to play at the BankAtlantic Center, but Heat owner Micky Arison wanted his team to remain in Miami-Dade, where he has a home.\nIn the end, Arison put $210 million toward construction, with the county spending $37.6 million to purchase the 17 waterfront acres along Biscayne Boulevard from the city of Miami. The county also paid a $5 million subsidy before the arena opened and agreed to give the team $6.4 million a year for operations.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T12:21:34Z","url":"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article1940277.html"}

Last week, Mr Rotich said Sh5.2 million had been added into the account since July.\nPublic servants earn an average of Sh47 billion a month or Sh568 billion annually.\nMr Rotich will in the meantime form a team to oversee the spending of the amount accumulated so far as Transformative Fund on development projects.\n“We will constitute a team to advise or propose transformative projects as the fund builds up,” he told the Business Daily.\nFailure by civil servants to embrace voluntary pay cut points to the herculean task that awaits Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba in his latest bid come up with a legislation chopping salaries of senior public officers by 50 per cent.\nApart from the top government officials in Mr Uhuru’s scheme, Mr Namwamba is targeting the Judicial Service Commission and Parliamentary Service Commission staff. A number of politicians, including national assembly speaker Justin Muturi, have dismissed the plan as populist.\nPresident Kenyatta had, on the other hand, counted on the goodwill of the senior staff of his administration to rein in public wage.\nCabinet secretaries, who earn Sh1.12 million, would each surrender Sh112, 000 per month to Treasury and PSs Sh91,000 each from their Sh910,000 pay.\nThis means that the account should be holding more than Sh70 million from deductions made on the pay of Cabinet and principal secretaries alone over the 18 months.\nThe public service also has more than 200 chief executives of State- owned firms.\nThe Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) had raised the red flag over the Sh568 billion wage bill, saying it is unsustainable.\nThe public wage bill takes up 52 per cent of government revenues, higher than the global average of 35 per cent for nations in the lower middle-income category, where Kenya belongs.\nState officers have to first write to the SRC, led by Sarah Serem, declaring that they are giving up a share of their pay.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T03:18:53Z","url":"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Top-officials-ignore-Uhuru-on-voluntary-pay-cut-call/-/539546/2887820/-/ltg91gz/-/index.html"}

{"text":"I’m not one to adhere rigidly to the idea of drinking seasonally: reds when it’s cold, whites and rosés when the weather heats up. This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering them. This means wines that are balanced and energetic, substantial rather than ethereal, yet not blusterous or domineering.\nHere are 20 red wines that meet those requirements, not ranked in any particular order. All are in that $15-to-$20 sweet spot where price intersects with quality and distinctiveness to yield great value. You can certainly find plenty of sound wines for less than $15, but chances are they will not be as interesting.\nFor more than $20, you can start to add in wines that may fit the bill from more highly regarded regions, like the northern Rhône, Priorat, even Burgundy, though pretty soon you could be spending a lot of money.\nStaying in the $15-to-$20 range requires searching outside the status areas, and trying wines that often come from little-known regions, are made from grapes that are not celebrated, and are frequently in limited production. If the wines are more familiar, like California cabernet sauvignon or Oregon pinot noir, they will often be made from young vines, or come from surplus grapes that were sold off.\nWhat you won’t find here are fabricated, artificial products made with technological shortcuts or grapes that come from inappropriate areas, which permit production of cheap bottles in great quantities.\nThis means that most people will be able to find only some of these wines. As always, ask for other recommendations at the best wine shop nearby.\nThe Shebang series, moderately priced wines from Morgan Twain-Peterson’s excellent Bedrock Wine Company, offers modern versions of California field blends. This spicy, gutsy wine comes from multiple vineyards and appellations, includes many grapes (with probably a lot of zinfandel and carignan), and mixes several vintages. The result is a delicious, long-lasting red with flavors of licorice, herbs and red and black fruits.\nCamp’s group of moderately priced Sonoma wines comes from Kenny Likitprakong’s Hobo Wine Company, which makes very good wines from all over California under several labels. This young cabernet is bright and well balanced, with a touch of earth and tannins that simply let you know they are there. It’s easy to enjoy right now, especially with juicy braised meats.\nGood, moderately priced pinot noir from California is tough to find, because most of it comes from areas not well suited to the grape. Searching for well-priced pinot noirs is far more rewarding in Oregon, where land and labor costs have not accelerated out of control. This one from Les Brebis, a small producer in the Willamette Valley, is direct and without the sort of artifice often found in inexpensive pinot noirs. Its earthy flavors of red and black fruits and herbs pair well with pork, chicken and salmon.\nWhy, here’s another one, also from the Willamette, and quite different in style from the Brebis. It’s made from organic and biodynamically grown grapes, and is equally elegant in profile. It’s a little more floral and herbal, and it has a meatier character, with a deliciously savory edge. Try it with hearty soups.\nYet another side of cabernet franc, this one comes from Wölffer Estate on the South Fork of Long Island. It’s rich and expressive, more in the Bordeaux style than the Loire, less subtle, more open and welcoming. It’s balanced and earthy, and though the tannins are still a bit firm, it will go well with a meaty stew.\nLike Wölffer Estate, Channing Daughters is based on the South Fork of Long Island, yet the estates could not be more different. Wölffer takes a more classical approach, but Channing is joyfully experimental, growing an eclectic range of grapes not otherwise seen on Long Island. The ’15 Rosso Fresco incorporates some of these — blaufränkisch and dornfelder along with merlot, syrah and cabernet franc. It’s bright, vividly fruity and floral, and absolutely delicious.\nSan Diego? Seriously? While the San Diego coast is more readily associated with beach volleyball and Navy bases, San Diego County is also home to a small wine region with some surprisingly good producers. Vesper Vineyards makes this fruity, smoky, well-balanced carignan tempered by citrus highlights.\nFoxglove is the reliable value arm of Varner Wine, which makes fine chardonnays and pinot noirs. Foxglove expands that range with moderately priced wines like this Paso Robles cabernet, which is bold and intense yet not at all a fruit bomb. It’s juicy and balanced, and will go well with steaks and chops.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the importer of Fattoria La Rivolta Aglianico del Taburno. It is T. Edward Wines, not T. Edwards Wine.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T04:54:39Z","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/dining/20-red-wines-for-winter.html?ref=dining"}

{"text":"A neutrino event, identifiable by the rings of Cerenkov radiation that show up along the photomultiplier tubes lining the detector walls, showcase the successful methodology of neutrino astronomy. This image shows multiple events.\nSometimes, the best-designed experiments fail. The effect you're looking for might not even occur, meaning that a null result should always be a possible outcome you're prepared for. When that happens, the experiment is often dismissed as a failure, even though you never would have known the results without performing it.\nYet, every once in a while, the apparatus that you build might be sensitive to something else entirely. When you do science in a new way, at a new sensitivity, or under new, unique conditions, that's often where the most surprising, serendipitous discoveries are made. In 1987, a failed experiment for detecting proton decay detected neutrinos, for the first time, from beyond not only our Solar System, but from outside of the Milky Way. This is how neutrino astronomy was born.\nThe conversion of a neutron to a proton, an electron, and an anti-electron neutrino is how Pauli hypothesized resolving the energy non-conservation problem in beta decay.\nAlpha decay, where a larger atom emits a helium nucleus, jumping two elements down the periodic table.\nBeta decay, where an atomic nucleus emits a high-energy electron, moving one element up the periodic table.\nGamma decay, where an atomic nucleus emits an energetic photon, remaining in the same location on the periodic table.\nIn any reaction, under the laws of physics, whatever the total energy and momentum of the initial reactants are, the energy and momentum of the final products need to match. For alpha and gamma decays, they always did. But for beta decays? Never. Energy was always lost.\nThe V-shaped track in the center of the image is likely a muon decaying to an electron and two neutrinos. The high-energy track with a kink in it is evidence of a mid-air particle decay. This decay, if the (undetected) neutrino is not included, would violate energy conservation.\nIn 1930, Wolfgang Pauli proposed a new particle that could solve the problem: the neutrino. This small, neutral particle could carry both energy and momentum, but would be extremely difficult to detect. It wouldn't absorb or emit light, and would only interact with atomic nuclei extremely rarely.\nUpon its proposal, rather than confident and elated, Pauli felt ashamed. \"I have done a terrible thing, I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected,\" he declared. But despite his reservations, the theory was vindicated by experiment.\nReactor nuclear experimental RA-6 (Republica Argentina 6), en marcha, showing the characteristic Cherenkov radiation from the faster-than-light-in-water particles emitted. The neutrinos (or more accurately, antineutrinos) first hypothesized by Pauli in 1930 were detected from a similar nuclear reactor in 1956.\nor they cause the emission of new particles, which have their own energies and momenta.\nEither way, you can build specialized particle detectors around where you expect the neutrinos to interact, and look for them. This was how the first neutrinos were detected: by building particle detectors sensitive to neutrino signatures at the edges of nuclear reactors. If you reconstructed the entire energy of the products, including neutrinos, energy is conserved after all.\nSchematic illustration of nuclear beta decay in a massive atomic nucleus. Only if the (missing) neutrino energy and momentum is included can these quantities be conserved.\nIn theory, neutrinos should be produced wherever nuclear reactions take place: in the Sun, in stars and supernovae, and whenever an incoming high-energy cosmic ray strikes a particle from Earth's atmosphere. By the 1960s, physicists were building neutrino detectors to look for both solar (from the Sun) and atmospheric (from cosmic ray) neutrinos.\nA large amount of material, with mass designed to interact with the neutrinos inside of it, would be surrounded by this neutrino detection technology. In order to shield the neutrino detectors from other particles, they were placed far underground: in mines. Only neutrinos should make it into the mines; the other particles should be absorbed by the Earth. By the end of the 1960s, solar and atmospheric neutrinos had both successfully been found.\nThe particle detection technology that was developed for both neutrino experiments and high-energy accelerators was found to be applicable to another phenomenon: the search for proton decay. While the Standard Model of particle physics predicts that the proton is absolutely stable, in many extensions — such as Grand Unification Theories — the proton can decay into lighter particles.\nIn theory, whenever a proton does decay, it will emit lower-mass particles at very high speeds. If you can detect the energies and momenta of those fast-moving particles, you can reconstruct what the total energy is, and see if it came from a proton.\nHigh-energy particles can collide with others, producing showers of new particles that can be seen in a detector. By reconstructing the energy, momentum, and other properties of each one, we can determine what initially collided and what was produced in this event.\nIf protons decay, their lifetime must be extremely long. The Universe itself is 1010 years old, but the proton's lifetime must be much longer. How much longer? The key is to look not at one proton, but at an enormous number. If a proton's lifetime is 1030 years, you can either take a single proton and wait that long (a bad idea), or take 1030 protons and wait 1 year to see if any decay.\nA liter of water contains a little over 1025 molecules in it, where each molecule contains two hydrogen atoms: a proton orbited by an electron. If the proton is unstable, a large enough tank of water, with a large set of detectors around it, should allow you to either measure or constrain its stability/instability.\nA schematic layout of the KamiokaNDE apparatus from the 1980s. For scale, the tank is approximately 15 meters (50 feet) tall.\nIn Japan, in 1982, they began constructing a large underground detector in the Kamioka mines. The detector was named KamiokaNDE: Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment. It was large enough to hold over 3,000 tons of water, with around a thousand detectors optimized to detect the radiation that fast-moving particles would emit.\nBy 1987, the detector had been running for years, without a single instance of proton decay. With around 1033 protons in that tank, this null result completely eliminated the most popular model among Grand Unified Theories. The proton, as far as we could tell, doesn't decay. KamiokaNDE's main objective was a failure.\nA supernova explosion enriches the surrounding interstellar medium with heavy elements. The outer rings are caused by previous ejecta, long before the final explosion. This explosion also emitted a huge variety of neutrinos, some of which made it all the way to Earth.\nBut then something unexpected happened. 165,000 years earlier, in a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, a massive star reached the end of its life and exploded in a supernova. On February 23, 1987, that light reached Earth for the first time.\nBut a few hours before that light arrived, something remarkable happened at KamiokaNDE: a total of 12 neutrinos arrived within a span of about 13 seconds. Two bursts — the first containing 9 neutrinos and the second containing 3 — demonstrated that the nuclear processes that create neutrinos occur in great abundance in supernovae.\nThree different detectors observed the neutrinos from SN 1987A, with KamiokaNDE the most robust and successful. The transformation from a nucleon decay experiment to a neutrino detector experiment would pave the way for the developing science of neutrino astronomy.\nand that neutrinos aren't slowed down as they travel from the core of the collapsing star to its photospher, the way that light is.\nEven today, more than 30 years later, we can examine this supernova remnant and see how it's evolved.\nThe outward-moving shockwave of material from the 1987 explosion continues to collide with previous ejecta from the formerly massive star, heating and illuminating the material when collisions occur. A wide variety of observatories continue to image the supernova remnant today.\nThe scientific importance of this result cannot be overstated. It marked the birth of neutrino astronomy, just as the first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes marked the birth of gravitational wave astronomy. It was the birth of multi-messenger astronomy, marking the first time that the same object had been observed in both electromagnetic radiation (light) and via another method (neutrinos).\nIt showed us the potential of using large, underground tanks to detect cosmic events. And it causes us to hope that, someday, we might make the ultimate observation: an event where light, neutrinos, and gravitational waves all come together to teach us all about the workings of the objects in our Universe.\nThe ultimate event for multi-messenger astronomy would be a merger of either two white dwarfs or two neutrons stars that was close enough. If such an event occurred in near-enough proximity to Earth, neutrinos, light, and gravitational waves could all be detected.\nMost cleverly, it resulted in a renaming of KamiokaNDE. The Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment was a total failure, so KamiokaNDE was out. But the spectacular observation of neutrinos from SN 1987A gave rise to a new observatory: KamiokaNDE, the Kamioka Neutrino Detector Experiment! Over the past 30+ years, this has now been upgraded many times, and multiple similar facilities have popped up all over the world.\nIf a supernova were to go off today, in our own galaxy, we would be treated to upwards of 10,000 neutrinos arriving in our detector. All of them, combined, have further constrained the lifetime of the proton to now be greater than around 1035 years, but that's not why we build them. Whenever a high-energy cataclysm occurs, neutrinos speed through the Universe. With our detectors online, neutrino astronomy is alive, well, and ready for whatever the cosmos sends our way.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T14:24:57Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/07/10/how-a-failed-nuclear-experiment-accidentally-gave-birth-to-neutrino-astronomy/"}

{"text":"The Associated Press Mining trucks carrying loads of oil-laden sand at the Albian Sands project in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada.\nIn the run-up to December’s global climate change meeting, fissures are emerging between Canada and the United States over how to deal with the internationally contentious issue of Alberta’s vast oil sands projects, which have been responsible for a sharp increase in Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions.\nAt an Ottawa conference last week, the president of the Center for American Progress, John Podesta, a co-chairman of President Obama’s transition team, reprimanded Canada for not keeping pace with the drive to adopt green energy technology.\n“The Canadians would be well served by keeping up with what’s going on in the United States with respect to this push towards clean technology,” he said, according to a report from Reuters.\nThe American ambassador to Canada, David Jacobson, declined to comment on whether Mr. Podesta’s remarks reflect the administration’s view.\nSujata Raisinghani, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Environment Ministry, said in an e-mail message that Canada’s intention is to develop a North American cap-and-trade system and “harmonize” the two countries’ climate-change policies.\nIn 2007, Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions were 33.8 percent higher than its Kyoto target, with “significant” growth due to “large increases in oil and gas production—much of it for export,” according to Canada’s 2007 Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which noted that emissions from the oil and gas extraction sector, along with mining, rose 276 percent from 1990 to 2007.\nAccording to an interview with Canada’s environment minister, Jim Prentice, published Friday in The Globe and Mail, Canada will be heading to Copenhagen looking for less aggressive emission targets than Europe or Japan because of its faster-growing population and energy-intensive industrial structure.\nWith climate-change bills working through Congress, environmentalists have pressed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to block the construction of large cross-border pipelines meant to increase exports of crude from bitumen refining operations.\nCanadian oil executives are concerned that new American fuel standards will work against bitumen crude, which requires vast amounts of natural gas to refine.\nMr. Prentice indicated last week that the Canadian government does not intend to reveal its negotiating position at Copenhagen before the American government does. He also told The Globe that hopes for a successful treaty in December seemed to be fading.\nCanada has proposed to cut its emissions by 20 percent from 2006 levels by 2020 – a modest target compared to European goals. In previous iterations of its climate policy, released during the Bush administration, the Canadian government pushed for emission intensity targets for a broad range of industries, including oil sands producers, rather than sectoral emission caps.\nEarlier this month, Mr. Jacobson, a close acquaintance of President Obama, toured the oil sands. “I’ve learned a lot about the tremendous strides that have been taken over the last several years with respect to improving the environmental record in treating the oil sands,” he told Reuters.\nBut at the other end of the diplomatic relationship, Canada’s new ambassador to Washington, Gary Doer, told The Calgary Herald last week that the oil sands get a “disproportionate” amount of criticism.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T14:15:19Z","url":"https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/of-albertas-oil-sands-and-harmonizing-canadian-and-us-climate-policy/?scp=1&amp;sq=alberta%20oil%20sands&amp;st=cse"}

{"text":"To help solve this problem, Andrew Foote and Emily Woods started Sanivation— No. 55 on the BI 100: The Creators — a sanitation startup that installs in-home toilets in East Africa and turns the waste into briquettes of sustainable, environmentally friendly fuel.\nFoote and Woods came up with the idea for turning waste into fuel as undergraduate students at Georgia Tech in 2011. The pair developed a thermal treatment system for human feces as a research project and later entered their work into Start-Up Chile, a business accelerator in South America.\nIn Naivasha, where outdoor pit latrines are the norm, the mention of an in-home toilet led many to immediately picture an open latrine inside their home — not a preferable alternative to the outdoor version. So Sanivation branded their version as \"blue boxes\" to dispel the negative connotations potential people had with the word \"toilet.\"\nSanivation combines two waste streams in a metal bucket — human excrement and carbonized agricultural biomass waste, which comes from things like sugarcane gas, corn cobs, rose farms, and rice husks — and heats it to a temperature that neutralizes harmful pathogens and allows the waste to be transformed into a briquette of fuel.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T09:24:31Z","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/kenya-startup-turns-poop-into-fuel-2016-6"}

{"text":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Foxconn Technology is in talks to manufacture Apple’s iPhone in India, government officials said, in a move that could lower prices in the world’s No.3 smartphone market where the U.S. firm trails Samsung Electronics and local players.\nIndia could help Foxconn mitigate accelerating wage inflation in China, where it makes the majority of iPhones, and base production sites closer to markets where its key clients want to grow.\nLower production costs could also help Foxconn keep hold of Apple orders amid intensifying competition with nimble manufacturing rivals such as Quanta Computer Inc.\n“Foxconn is sending a delegation of their officers to scout for locations in a month’s time,” Subhash Desai, Industries Minister of India’s western state Maharashtra, told Reuters.\nFoxconn has said it is aiming to develop 10-12 facilities in India, including factories and data centers, by 2020, but had given no detail.\nThe Taiwan-based tech giant, the world’s largest contract maker of electronic products, declined to comment on detailed plans on Thursday, citing commercial sensitivity.\nDesai said Foxconn had yet to make any firm commitment, but he said the group was looking to manufacture iPhones, iPads and iPods, both for domestic as well as global sales.\nApple representatives in India did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\nApple’s iPhone 6 with 16 GB sells for around 44,000 rupees ($687.82) in India, versus Samsung’s Galaxy S6 with 32 GB which sells for around 40,000 rupees ($625.29).\nIt has 10 percent market share in India, trailing Samsung and local manufacturers such as Micromax, which dominate the market, according to Counterpoint Research Market Monitor.\nA return of Foxconn — which was forced to shut up shop in India last year after client Nokia closed — would be a major victory for India, which badly needs to turn its tech boom into a manufacturing and employment boost.\nIndia, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has sought to reboot manufacturing, but the country is yet to rival China, particularly in technology where most factories will likely be assembly units to begin with.\nBut local businessmen are betting that as global companies invest in the country, suppliers will follow.\nA lack of good infrastructure and suppliers are the biggest hurdles to making technology products in the country, forcing most of India’s more than 100 different phone companies to get their products from the mature markets of China and Taiwan.\nApple is among the biggest clients for Foxconn — the trade name for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd — which also makes components for companies such as Xiaomi, Acer and Sony.\n“The smartphone boom in India indicates the time is just right to focus on expansion plans and increasing volume in India to a comparable level with the China market in the next five years,” said Sky Li, vice president of phone manufacturer OPPO.\nIndia has the second-highest number of mobile phone accounts behind China. According to networking solutions company Cisco Systems, there will be 650 million smartphones in the country by 2019.

{"text":"On Jan. 12, detectives in Montgomery County received a video depicting a 65-year-old day-care operator interacting with a 2-year-old girl. By the end of the day, the operator, Christina Dhanaraj, was under arrest and charged with second-degree child abuse, officials said Tuesday.\nIn arrest records, detectives described what they saw.\n\"The video starts with the victim sitting quietly in a room inside a residence,\" they wrote, relating then that the suspect walked up and scolded the child. \"Dhanaraj then proceeds to deliver approximately eight open-hand slaps to the victim's face. While she was being repeatedly and violently slapped, the victim was loudly crying.\"\nDhanaraj, who is free on bond, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Her attorney, Patrick Hanifin, declined to discuss the specific police allegations. \"Our team is still investigating the matter in its entirety,\" Hanifin said. \"Ms. Dhanaraj has the full support of her husband and two adult children.\"\nDhanaraj has been operating the day-care facility out of her Silver Spring home for about 10 years and was licensed to have up to eight children there, according to county and state records.\nPolice said they are not identifying the person who shot the video, which may have been taken in November or December, because the person is a witness.\nDetectives spoke with the girl's parents after receiving the video. \"There were no apparent injuries that the parents remembered seeing,\" said Sgt. Rebecca Innocenti, a county police spokeswoman.\nIn the video, according to arrest records, Dhanaraj also can be seen shoving the victim to the floor while she was still crying, grabbing her by the head and jerking her body.\nOfficials at the Maryland Office of Child Care (OCC), who were shown the video by police, issued an emergency suspension of the facility. In a letter to Dhanaraj, an OCC official wrote that \"you seemed to be upset that the child soiled her diaper\" and yelled at the child for doing so.\nThe Office of Child Care had no history of complaints or reported problems with the day care before this case, according to regulators.\nOn Aug. 23, 2006, Dhanaraj was issued an \"initial family child care registration certificate to operate\" out of the Winding Waye Lane home. Of the capacity for eight children, she was authorized to have two under the age of 2. Eventually, the operation was permitted to accommodate four under the age of 2.\nIn their suspension letter to Dhanaraj, regulators reviewed her licensing history and listed several recent problems.\nOn Jan. 12, according to the letter, two day-care licensing specialists went to Dhanaraj's home with Montgomery detectives. They noted 14 compliance issues, including a lack of attendance records before January, missing barriers on several stairs, and cleaning agents and kitchen knives in drawers and cabinets children could reach.\nThe letter also cited the video and Dhanaraj's arrest.\n\"You must close your family child care home immediately,\" the letter stated.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T07:48:32Z","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/day-care-operator-charged-with-slapping-2-year-old-girl-eight-times-over-soiled-diaper/2018/01/23/83b03ece-0061-11e8-8acf-ad2991367d9d_story.html"}

{"text":"Following in her mother’s footsteps, 23-year-old Shakisa Olinda Harvey is among the newest admissions to the bar after graduating last Saturday from the Hugh Wooding Law School as an Attorney-at-Law.\nThe bubbly Harvey is the daughter of recently-appointed High Court Judge Justice Simone Morris-Ramlall.\nAlways certain of the career path she wanted to pursue, Harvey, who was called to the bar on Monday, said she has proven that determination, hard work and dedication truly pays off.\nPresenting her petition before Madame Chief Justice (ag) Roxane George, attorney Abiola Wong-Inniss, to whose chambers Harvey is attached as an associate, described her as industrious.\nRecalling Harvey’s in-service stints spent at her chambers during her vacations home from law school, Wong-Inniss said her performance was always exemplary.\nThe lawyer said that she was honoured not only to have been presenting Harvey’s petition, but more importantly to have her within the employ of her chambers, where her knowledge and expertise will make her an asset.\nIn her charge, the Chief Justice reminded the young attorney that she has “human precedents” to follow and admonished her to strive always for excellence. “Never settle for mediocrity,” the Chief Justice warned.\nHarvey was encouraged to “be a lawyer’s, lawyer,” and to truly advocate for her clients, providing to them the best counsel always. Justice George cautioned that the sleepless nights will continue, and that the word “research” must always be her mantra.\nLooking intently at the Chief Justice as she counseled her, the new lawyer heard that “service” to others and being a voice for the voiceless will be key to upholding the rule of law.\n“You’re not aiming to be any lawyer or some lawyer, you are aiming for excellence,” Justice George said, “Be a leader… Aim to be famous and not infamous,” she added.\nA former student of the Bishops’ High School like Harvey, Justice George said it is always an honour to admit students of her alma mater to the legal profession. She, however, noted that in Harvey’s case it was particularly memorable as it is the same date that she herself was admitted to the bar.\nIn her speech thanking the court for accepting her petition, Harvey, who became emotional and was moved to tears, also expressed gratitude for her mother’s unwavering support throughout her studies.\nFrom a lengthy list which she said was by no means exhaustive, the young woman said she owes a debt of gratitude to everyone who played a part in her attaining her dream and noted that she shares her achievement with them all.\nRecalling her stint as a reporter with the Stabroek News some years ago, Harvey said she was grateful for the opportunity of exposure to the courtroom, which she noted will no doubt be an asset for her career.\nHarvey’s call to the Bar was witnessed by loved ones, friends and other well-wishers.\nAfter attending the Bishops’ High School from 2010 to 2012, where she completed Sixth Form studies, Harvey moved on to the University of Guyana, where she read for, and attained her Bachelor of Law Degree in 2015.

{"text":"Fans, coaches and players -- not just officials -- need to step up their games before disaster strikes.\nIf you follow me on social media (the math involving my modest number of followers says it’s unlikely) you know I’ve been consistent in my bewilderment at the officiating of area high school football games this season.\nOfficiating has affected, and perhaps determined, the outcome of several games. My beef hasn’t simply been about judgment calls that appeared to be judged incorrectly (those happen), but rather with the mechanics.\nCrews have often bumbled yardage mark offs, spots (the ball can’t be exactly on the yard line EVERY time – that’s lazy), downs and rules. The common occurrences expose inexperienced, perhaps undertrained officials.\nHowever, there are reasons for the above. Who in the heck would want to be an official today? One hundred bucks a game isn’t terrible, but do you want to be the subject of nonstop verbal abuse for three hours?\nShreveport football officiating 101: Why take the abuse?\nThe officiating hasn't been the only embarrassing factor in games I’ve attended, or received reports from. I’m not sure if some coaches spent more time calling plays and schemes or crawling in the ear holes of the folks in stripes.\nThe actions in the stands isn’t any better. If the right team wins or executes a terrific play, fans are happy. If not, it’s the officials’ fault. The mind-set is completely out of control.\nI covered the North Webster-Loyola game last week and witnessed the cops called to the field twice. One instance involved a disruptive member of the chain gang, the second sent a handful of officers to track down an unruly, profanity-loving fan.\nYoung athletes aren’t winning in life if parents and coaches conjure excuses to blame everyone else for a lack of execution or the fact another team/player is simply better. Winning is terrific; I’m as competitive as they come. However, losing can teach us all just as much, and, in the long run, produce victories.\nI’ve never heard of a college coach or NFL scout pass on a kid because the referee made a bad call. If your kid is good enough, he or she will get there. And it’s better off if they’re tough and able to self-evaluate. If they look the other way and point fingers amid adversity, good luck, the road will be much bumpier.\nIt’s not good for anyone to look into the stands and see parents literally fighting (not at the Week 10 game I attended), or throwing food on the field because of a perceived bad call. It’s also not good to see officials (barely) escape a mob of hysterical fans – despite the help of policemen -- at a local game.\nOne local coach called the referee at the center of the Loyola-North Webster game “the one guy I’d choose to referee my games.” The point: Officials, like your favorite team, can struggle. They’re human. But they didn’t put your boys in a three-touchdown hole.\nAmazingly, fans don’t credit officials after victories. How is that possible?\nI'm more incensed by the aftermath of such incidents like the ones I witnessed at Loyola. Adult rarely (at best) take responsibility for their – or fellow fans’ – actions. A bad call doesn’t give the rest of us carte blanche. Imagine if everyone around you lost their marbles and you became a bull's-eye for vitriol after you dub a coach’s decision “idiotic” moments before it works and you’re on your feet cheering.\nNo one gets it all right.\nAs Friday’s game developed, some of the Loyola players popped off in frustration, and that’s not to be excused, but they, along with Loyola coaches, were ultimately forced to turn from the field of play and tell their fan base to cool it as things got heated at Messmer Stadium.\nThe kids had to tell the parents to act like adults.\nBy no stretch are the officials or fans present at the Loyola game the only problem. I’ve seen it – on and off the field -- all season. However, it was Week 10. We’re now in the postseason. If we don’t compose ourselves, playoff implications could take rage to another level and that’s when national headlines – not good ones -- could be made.\n“Johnny” doesn’t want to carry the burden of watching his parents punching (or worse) a fan or official on YouTube for the rest of his life.\nBoo the officials or opposing fans all you want, it’s tradition. However, verbal and physical abuse is sometimes illegal and always completely embarrassing. The actions, the threats toward officials are getting worse.\nI know social media, and the current climate, has made it OK to call each other names, disrespect one another and demean opinions without merit, but for crying out loud think about your actions when you’re in public. At least spam-like usernames and accounts can help hide your identity on social media.\nBut Friday nights are real life. With real-life implications. Coach the games, watch the games, officiate the games. Stop deflecting blame and embrace the teachable moments in wins and losses. And more importantly, remember those are fellow human beings who drop passes, miss blocks and butcher pass interference calls.\nWe can all be better. We must be better.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T08:38:24Z","url":"https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/columnists/roy-lang/2018/11/08/prep-football-playoffs-have-arrived-we-all-need-better/1932449002/"}

When you're here, you're right smack in the middle of it.\nThe Brew Stooges, a craft beer venture started by business partners Bramon, Tracy Mullins and Jeff Peck, launched a new tasting room and outdoor seating area a few months ago at its facility on 109 Maple Ave.\nWith help from volunteers and groups like Know Huntsville, Mullins, Peck and Bramon have seen their customer base grow in recent months with the addition of free barbecue on Saturday nights, music events and even a live podcast.\n\"It's doing a lot better than we originally envisioned to start off with,\" Bramon said. \"And it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.\"\nDown the street from the iconic, now-closed Tip Top Café, the beer makers are working on new signage to attract more brew lovers to the downtown brewery and tap room, which seats up to 25.\nAlthough there are a couple of picnic tables out back, Bramon said the crowds have been so large they \"routinely have people standing.\"\nThe Brew Stooges isn't the only local craft beer business seeing hefty growth. Rocket Republic Brewing Co. announced in June it will launch a brew house and tap room in Madison, while Huntsville's Straight to Ale recently expanded into the Atlanta market.\nThe Alabama Brewers Guild reported in April that statewide beer production grew 47 percent last year. The number of taxable removal barrels (the amount of beer sold and taxed) was 28,373 in 2013, up 47 percent from 2012, while the number of breweries nearly doubled from seven in 2012 to 13 in 2013.\nYou can now find The Brew Stooges' local brews at Huntsville's Bandito Burrito, West End Grill, The Nook, Mellow Mushroom and Pie in the Sky. Their beer is also on tap in Decatur, Athens, Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery and Tuscaloosa.\nPeck, who spends his work days at NASA, feels good about their progress.\n\"We want to try to grow the business organically with the market,\" he said. \"If the market doesn't grow, then we don't get any bigger ... but I think it will. We think we can grow our market into Alabama, as well as at some point go across state lines.\"\nThe brewhouse is located in a building where Mullins ran his side business, Complete Plumbing, for about 10 years. The trio started construction on the property in the spring of 2012 before opening a year later.\nDuring the first 10 months of operation, Peck said they were busy getting their processes down, reaching distribution agreements and landing new markets. When they felt comfortable enough to move forward with the expansion, they assembled the tap room.\nThe brewhouse is open to the public from 5 to 9 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Bramon said they're working with the city of Huntsville to bring a trolley to the downtown brewery.\n\"If we can get folks to ride the trolley down here, that means we'll be on the normal downtown circuit,\" he said. \"You can come downtown and visit us anytime you want and you don't have to drive.\"\nA beer tasting with The Brew Stooges will take place July 12 and 26 during The Lowry House's Backyard Concert Series.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T08:14:14Z","url":"https://www.al.com/business/2014/07/the_brew_stooges_opens_new_tap.html"}

{"text":"Martin Scorsese and Robert Di Niro will collaborate for the first time in decades.\nMartin Scorsese's \"Silence\" may have been his 28-year-old passion project, but it was mostly ignored by audiences, grossing only $7 million in the U.S. opposite a $40 million budget. Something tells us the same fate won't meet the director's next project, which carries an even bigger budget and bigger stars.\nJack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Departed\"\nScorsese has built his career on iconic gangster movies, from \"Goodfellas\" to \"Casino,\" \"Mean Streets\" and \"The Departed,\" so his return to the genre after more than a decade is cause for celebration.\n\"The Irishman\" is based on the 2003 book \"I Heard You Paint Houses\" by Charles Brandt, which recounts the years Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran spent as a mob hitman. Brandt interviewed Sheeran over a five-year period, during which the mobster confessed to being involved in more than 25 hits for the mob. Sheeran was allegedly involved in the death of legendary mob boss Jimmy Hoffa, who went missing in July 1975 and was never found.\nAnyone hoping for Scorsese to capture the cinematic energy of \"Goodfellas\" once again may want to lower their expectations. It appears the filmmaker is going to be making a much more elegiac and sobering gangster movie this time around. \"The Irishman\" picks up with Sheeran as an older man as he looks back on the hits that defined his mob career.\n\"The people are also older in 'The Irishman,' it's certainly more about looking back, a retrospective so to speak of a man's life and the choices that he's had to make,\" Scorsese told The Independent in May.\nAs to whether the movie follows in the tradition of \"Goodfellas\"? He told the outlet, \"I think this is different, I think it is. I admit that there are - you know, 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' have a certain style that I created for them - it's on the page in the script actually…The style of the picture, the cuts, the freeze-frames, all of this was planned way in advance, but here it's a little different.\"\nRobert De Niro in \"Casino\"\nScorsese and Robert De Niro's careers are intertwined after making eight movies together, including \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Raging Bull\" and \"The King of Comedy.\" But the duo haven't made a movie together since \"Casino,\" which was released 22 years ago in November 1995. \"The Irishman\" will mark their ninth collaboration.\nWhile Scorsese's career in the two decades since has remained strong, De Niro hasn't really had a critically acclaimed lead dramatic role in several years. He earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" but reuniting with Scorsese is just what his big screen career needs most right now.\nJoe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro in \"Goodfellas\"\nThe supporting cast for \"The Irishman\" is truly an embarrassment of riches: Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Bobby Cannavale. But arguably the most anticipated bit of casting is Joe Pesci, who has only had two credits to his name this century: A cameo in De Niro's 2006 CIA drama \"The Good Shepherd\" and a lead role in Taylor Hackford's 2010 flop \"Love Ranch.\" Prior to 2006, Pesci hadn't starred in a single movie since 1998's \"Lethal Weapon 4.\" The semi-retired actor is officially coming back to the big screen for a \"Goodfellas\" reunion with Scorsese and De Niro.\nPesci had been rumored to be joining \"The Irishman,\" but his casting wasn't confirmed until earlier this month. He's reportedly playing Russell Bufalino, a Mafia boss operating out of Pennsylvania who has long been suspected of having a hand in Hoffa's disappearance. The character means we'll most likely be seeing Pesci and De Niro in scenes opposite one another.\nScorsese and Pesci have made three movies together. Pesci won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his turn in \"Goodfellas.\"\n\"The Irishman\" will follow in the footsteps of \"Hugo\" as a Scorsese movie that depends heavily on visual effects. The director is teaming with George Lucas' VFX company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to utilize the same effects used on Brad Pitt in \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" so that De Niro can be digitally aged to look younger in the flashback scenes.\n\"The Irishman\" will include flashbacks that span decades, and De Niro is set to play Sheeran in all of them. He'll appear as young as 30 years old.\nThe visual effects required for \"The Irishman\" are part of the reason the film's budget is over the $100 million mark. That's a massive price tag for any filmmaker, and it's why Scorsese has taken up shop at Netflix to make the movie despite his love of the theatrical experience over streaming.\n\"The Irishman\" has been in development since 2008 and was originally going to be backed by Paramount Pictures, but the studio couldn't afford to take on such a risky budget. International rights were purchased by STX Entertainment for $50 million at Cannes 2016, but they backed down after Netflix took over for Paramount and bought worldwide streaming rights.\n\"The Irishman\" is officially shooting in New York City this summer, with a production start date set for the middle of August. Principal photography is scheduled until December. The five-month shoot will just a bit longer than the filming of \"Silence,\" which took place in Taiwan from January 30 to May 15, 2015. But it's nothing compared to \"Gangs of New York\" shoot. That massive production lasted for nearly eight months (August 2000 - April 2001).\nMatin Scorsese and Andrew Garfield on the set of \"Silence\"\nA lot of attention surrounding \"The Irishman\" is being paid to the people appearing in front of the camera, but just as exciting are the collaborators joining Scorsese behind it. Most notable is cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who has become a favorite of Scorsese's in recent years after shooting both \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Silence.\" The latter earned him his second Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. His first was for \"Brokeback Mountain\" in 2005. Prieto first earned attention for his work with Alejandro González Iñárritu (\"Amores perros,\" \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\").\nScreenwriter Steve Zallian, meanwhile, adapted the book for the big screen. Zallian, who just earned an Emmy nomination for directing his HBO limited series \"The Night Of,\" wrote the script for Scorsese's \"Gangs of New York\" and earned an Oscar nomination. He won Best Adapted Screenplay for \"Schindler's List\" in 1993.\nScorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker will also return for \"The Irishman.\" She was the editor on the director's 1967 feature debut, \"Who's That Knocking at My Door,\" and has edited all of his films since \"Raging Bull\" in 1980. Her work with Scorsese has resulted in six Oscar nominations for Best Editing and three wins (\"Raging Bull,\" \"The Aviator\" and \"The Departed\").\nAnd now for the bad news: \"The Irishman\" won't be released until 2019. At the very earliest we could get an Oscar-qualifying run in select theaters in late December 2018, but reports say Netflix is eyeing a day-and-date rollout in 2019. Because of the extensive VFX work required, it makes sense the movie won't open for a year after the cameras stop rolling. Let the long wait for \"The Irishman\" begin.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T10:17:11Z","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/martin-scorseses-the-irishman-9-things-to-know-2017-7"}

{"text":"Granite Geek: When is a drought not a drought?\nRight now in Concord, we are living in a meteorological puzzle: The National Weather Service says this is the wettest August since records began being kept 150 years ago, yet the National Weather Service also says the region is “abnormally dry,” the first stage of its drought-measurement scale.\nNo, climate change hasn’t driven weather folks crazy. The solution to the puzzle is that there are droughts and then there are droughts.\n“There is a time lapse in how different systems respond to current conditions,” is how Richard Kiah, chief of Hydrologic Network Operations for the regional office of the U.S. Geological Survey, puts it.\nIn laymen’s terms: When wet weather appears, as it did in July, after a long stretch of very dry weather like we had this spring, the grass starts growing pretty quickly but it takes longer to fill up the aquifers that our wells depend on. A drought above ground might end, might even give way to flooding, while drought lingers below ground.\nThat’s roughly what we’re seeing now, although thankfully the drought and flooding have been minor compared to other parts of the country.\nAs of Saturday, the official rainfall total in Concord for the month of August is 9.36 inches, breaking the all-time August record of 9 inches, set in 1892. Even so, Concord and the swath of central New Hampshire from Sullivan County to Carroll County are officially “abnormally dry,” the first of five categories on the federal drought-measurement scale.\nThis discrepancy is a function of the “time lapse” that Kiah mentioned above. As an illustration, he pointed to the town of Warner.\nUSGS maintains a series of measuring devices around the state that keep track of groundwater levels, meaning how much water is available for wells, and other devices that measure how much is flowing on the surface in rivers. Warner has a stream gauge measuring flow on the Warner River, and also a groundwater well nearby.\nAt the end of March, which is roughly when the dry spell began, the stream gauge in Warner was measuring water flow above the 95th percentile point for that time of year, meaning more water was flowing in the river than almost late March in history. The groundwater level was almost that high as well: It was in the 90th percentile.\nBy mid-July, after two months of bone-dry weather, the surface stream gauge had plunged almost to the 10th percentile, meaning that nearly nine out of 10 past Julys had seen more water in the river, definitely a drought signal. Yet at the same time, groundwater gauge was still in the “normal” range, just slightly under the long-term average.\nBoth gauges are now trending upwards, and I would guess that in the next few weeks central New Hampshire will be out of the drought category entirely, as they are already in southern New Hampshire. It’s not straightforward, though.\nThe designation of drought requires more than just measuring recent rainfall or water flows. Other factors intrude, notably evapotranspiration, which is the measure of how much of the moisture falling from the ground and existing in the air as humidity is used by plants.\n“At this time of year, some of the rainfall is not going to be recharging the groundwater, it’s going to be taken up by the plants and trees,” Kiah said. So even if a wet period is good for plants, fixing the agricultural drought, it may not be all that good for long-term water supplies.\nAll this makes determining whether we’re in a drought something of an art as well as a science, balancing the needs of plants and people today with the needs of plants and people in the coming weeks and months.\n“New Hampshire’s drought management plan takes into account these things,” Kiah said.\nThe terminology goes from meteorological drought, due to a lack of rain, to agricultural drought, when the soil dries out, to hydrological drought, affecting groundwater and stream flows. Perhaps what should happen is that we give up on the idea of announcing whether we’re in a drought and instead announce whether we’re in any of three possible types of drought.\nBut probably not. That would confuse people more than enlighten them.\nAfter all, designating a drought is as much a social and political marker as a scientific marker. It gives governments authority to impose watering bans and it motivates people to save water. Even if it isn’t always logically consistent, it’s still useful.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T16:57:40Z","url":"https://www.concordmonitor.com/drought-types-agriculture-groundwater-19545067"}

{"text":"Activist shareholders in Australia’s largest independent coalminer are expected to vote in record numbers on Thursday to demand Whitehaven Coal aligns its long-term company strategy with the Paris climate agreement.\nGuardian Australia understands the group Market Forces has secured support from some superannuation funds and large overseas investors in Whitehaven for three resolutions that will be put to the company’s annual general meeting in Sydney.\nWill van der Pol, a legal researcher and campaigner at Market Forces, said investors had been “receptive” in recent discussions.\nOne non-binding advisory resolution calls on the company to disclose climate change-related risks to shareholders, in line with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures.\nAnother proposal says that shareholders call on the board to make strategy and capital expenditure decisions “consistent with the climate goals of the Paris agreement” in order to safeguard the longer-term success of the company and respond to risks and opportunities posed by climate change.\n“We move this resolution in order to ensure our company is protected from stranded asset risks, and poised to take advantage of regulatory and market changes as international action is taken to satisfy the goals established by the Paris climate change agreement,” a supporting statement says.\n“Given the higher stranding risk of coal assets over oil and gas, coal producers should be acting more urgently than other fossil fuel producers.\nAny substantial level of support would be significant, considering Whitehaven is a pure-play coalminer.\nThe company released a statement to the ASX on 5 October that indicated it would consider climate risk reporting in 2019, a move interpreted as a concession to activist shareholders. It followed an Australian Securities and Investments Commission report last month critical of the level of climate risk disclosures by companies.\n“Whitehaven is committed to playing a role in reducing carbon emissions ... by promoting increased use of Whitehaven’s high-quality, low-emissions coal,” the company said in its statement to the ASX.\nWhitehaven’s future planning is based on the “New Policies Scenario” of the International Energy Agency, under which coal demand to Asia would double by 2040. Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nUnder a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040.\nVan de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday’s Whitehaven AGM were “an opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing”.\n“These sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,” he said.\nClimate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace.\nAt last week’s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company’s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin.\nThe Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company’s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about “stranded asset risk”.\n“At some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,” Poole said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T23:06:10Z","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/25/whitehaven-coal-activist-shareholders-to-force-vote-on-climate-strategy"}

A group of students are alleging they were misled about school's medical lab technician program.\nCLASS ACTION: Astrid Estrada listens as Ernestine Latimer discusses her complaints against Newbridge College.\nCOMPLAINTS: Ernestine Latimer, left, and Astrid Estrada, right, discuss their grievances against Newbridge College.\nSANTA ANA — Unhappy former students have filed a class-action lawsuit against Newbridge College, alleging they were each defrauded out of $10,000 tuition by promises they could earn good salaries for medical jobs they were ineligible to obtain.\nTwelve former students say they were persuaded to enroll on the promise that they needed only training from Newbridge to get lucrative jobs as medical laboratory technicians.\nThe plaintiffs said they didn’t learn until well into the eight-month program that lab technician positions paying $18-$24 an hour require an accredited associate’s degree that the school does not offer.\nNewbridge’s attorney, Keith Zakarin, with the Duane Morris LLP law office in San Diego, said the school makes it clear students will be eligible only for entry-level jobs after they finish their training.\n“No one was misled,” Zakarin said.\nNewbridge College enrolls about 500 students on campuses in Santa Ana, Long Beach, Monterey Park and Glendale.\nThe college also reported to the federal government that it was offering a clinical/medical laboratory technician diploma during the 2007-08 academic year for $9,950 to students who completed 36 credit hours over eight months, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\nBut to become a licensed technician, candidates must have at least an associate’s degree or possess three years’ on-the-job training and pass a tough exam. The jobs pay $30,000 to $47,000 a year, according to state employment figures.\nWithout the license, students would only qualify for lower-paid jobs as lab assistants, for example, who freeze specimens or prepare blood or urine samples to be tested, said Debbie Wagner of Cupertino-based DeAnza College.\nWagner runs one of only two programs approved by the California Department of Public Health to train medical laboratory technicians.\n“Why would they pay $10,000 to be trained for a job that doesn’t pay any more than they earn now?” said the students’ lawyer, Scott Schutzman, who filed the Orange County Superior Court lawsuit in June.\nThe confusion seems to result from changes in the state law that took place in December, when the Department of Public Health began regulating medical laboratory technician jobs and giving them more authority and pay. Before December, only trained scientists with advanced degrees were allowed to perform blood counts, urinalysis, cholesterol and other laboratory tests in California.\nHowever, because of a lack of a workforce, the state began the process several years ago of changing the job descriptions to allow a newly created breed of trained and licensed medical laboratory technicians to perform those tests.\nWagner said that people in the field had been aware for years that the rules were changing and that, in fact, that’s why she started DeAnza’s program.\nNewbridge students said they only learned they were ineligible for the technician jobs during a field trip to a hospital laboratory, when a lab director told them she would only hire them as assistants.\nZakarin said that, prior to the change in the law, medical lab technician programs “did not need DPH approval” except for the aspects that included phlebotomy certification, which involves drawing blood.\nThe job to which he’s referring, though, is that of a lab associate – essentially an assistant, not a technician who actually performs the tests.\n“After the change in the law, the specific MLT job outcome required an associate’s (degree) and because NC’s program is a diploma program; it was not eligible for DPH approval of the entire program,” Zakarin said.\nRegister news researcher Michael Doss contributed to this report.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T20:06:07Z","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2008/07/18/former-enrollees-file-class-action-suit-against-newbridge-college/?shared=email&msg=fail"}

{"text":"Q: My great uncle, born in 1874 was the keeper of this bottle which he kept in a curio cabinet in my childhood. It might have belonged to another relative who worked in the china department of Woolworths from 1910-1930. Is it possible that such an item would be sold at Woolworths? My uncle also inherited items from a friend who was a scholar at the University of Leipzig circa 1898. My wife and I would be interested in learning anything you can tell us about this attractive object.\nA: Your attractive figural fish scent bottle is very rare. It is hand-blown green cased glass which has an inner white layer, a middle vibrant green layer and an outer clear layer harboring the applied gilt enamel. The tail is shaped and molded when the glass is molten with a hand tool. The eye is an applied red cabochon set in white enamel. The sterling silver cap was made by the firm of George Edwin Walton & Co. Ltd. in 1881-82 at Hylton Street, Birmingham. It harbors a cork which seals when screwed on. As the bottle can only lay on its side the cork was kept moist, causing it to swell keeping it sealed. These figural scent bottles are usually attributed to Thomas Webb & Sons – one of the most successful glass companies of England operating in the Stourbridge area close to Birmingham. These virtually never come on the market and at auction it will probably swim to $2,500 or more.\nQ: My husband’s brother inherited the ancestral home which contained a few antiques. No one knows how old this pitcher and bowl set is or where it came from, but we would like to know if it has any value. The name ‘Walmer’ and ‘E.H.’ are markings on the bottom. It is in very good shape.\nA: You have a very early brown transfer wash set dating to the 1850s. The ‘Walmer’ pattern is quite rare in transfer-decorated pottery. This is a romantic interpretation after the defensive castle built by Henry VIII in the 1500s. It is English and likely stands for Elijah Hughes & Co., of the Bleakhill Works, Cobridge in the Staffordshire region of England. The company operated from 1853 to 1867 making earthenwares. The shape of the pitcher and basin is typical for the 1840s and ’50s with the eight-sided panels. It’s a durable ironstone body and was also done in blue and white and an almost black mulberry. It’s in remarkable condition and is worth $250 today.\nA: Delos Cline Bell is the artist. He is known mainly for oil paintings of portraits and genre scenes — and they are all rare. Yours extends the known period of his painting career as well as the geographic area he worked in since he is listed as being active from 1850 to 1877 in the areas of Hamilton (being born in Beamsville in 1829) and Ottawa. He died in 1918. His work is crisp with a slightly primitive element to it — a desirable characteristic that is also present in yours. The high detail of the house architecture and the garb of the four figures makes it historically interesting. This small piece of art will have collectors reaching in their pockets for at least $500.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T23:57:11Z","url":"https://ottawacitizen.com/life/homes/antiques-scent-bottle-is-a-real-catch"}
{"text":"Seven years ago the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited one out of every 90 individual income tax returns. Last year it was one out of every 119. This year it is expected to be just one out of every 143. And for those who don’t include a Schedule C or other special (i.e., tax shelter, farm income) forms, the audit rate drops even further: one out of every 330.\nEven high-income earners (over $1 million a year) can breathe easier, at least for the moment. In 2015, the agency audited nearly 10 out of every 100 of those returns while this year it’ll only be able to audit fewer than six. Business audits have also been declining. Four years ago the IRS audited nearly 10,000 businesses while last year that number dropped to just 6,453.\nThe decline is due to punishment through budget cuts by Congress for the agency’s egregious mismanagement and malpractice behaviors including Commissioner John Koskinen’s lying to Congress last year, which almost got him impeached, and the political profiling of Tea Party groups before that. The IRS now employs fewer than 80,000 people, down from 94,722 in 2010, with the enforcement staff seeing the most drastic declines: more than 30 percent since 2010.\nThe IRS has a history of overreach and mismanagement. In 2003, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found IRS lawyers Kenneth McWade and William Sims guilty of blackmailing taxpayers in order to obtain testimony against other taxpayers. They consequently were disbarred. In May 2015, the agency announced that its computer systems had been hacked and that, as a result, the private tax information of more than 100,000 citizens had been stolen. In August of that year, the IRS said that the breach was far larger than originally thought: 220,000 additional private files had been compromised. A few months later, in February 2016, the IRS admitted that the previous disclosures were in error: More than 700,000 Social Security numbers and other “sensitive” information had been stolen.\nAll of that appears to be ancient history with the new sheriff in town, President Donald Trump, and his deputy, Steven Mnuchin, heading up the Treasury Department. Mnuchin knows that for every 35 cents that it spends in collection efforts the IRS brings in $100. He knows that whistleblowers have brought in billions. He knows that the new program to revoke passports of those taxpayers owing more than $50,000 is likely to force them to pay up. He knows that for every $1 it spends on face-to-face audits with taxpayers the agency reaps $4 in return. He knows that for every dollar of new revenue it might receive from Congress it could generate between $4 and $6 dollars in revenue. He knows that Trump is a businessman very familiar with such numbers. Consequently Mnuchin thinks he can make a “return-on-investment” case that could result in a significant increase in the IRS’s current budget of $11 billion.\nDespite the new deputy in charge of the Treasury, which runs the IRS, Trump will likely have a tough time getting Congress to approve any more than a modest increase in the agency’s budget. In the meantime taxpayers have a little more time to breathe a little easier.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T13:07:01Z","url":"https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/25461-good-bad-news-from-irs-audits-down-again-new-treasury-secretary-wants-larger-budget"}

{"text":"I ran away from home at the age of 40. It was a home I had wanted for a long time, walked past when I lived a few blocks away. I finally got my wish and was able to buy it. It was shaded by tall, mature trees; a treehouse had been constructed between the branches of a huge avocado tree. An apricot tree groaned with fruit during the summers.\nI was married at the time, and my then-husband and I added a new garage to the property, painted the inside of the house, transformed the kitchen. I spent hours in the garden creating flower beds, planting new trees.\nThe places we live seem to absorb the memories we are making. We turn a corner and collide with the past. I got divorced while living in the house shaded by trees. Newly single, I struggled through a couple of other relationships, both of them turbulent and destructive. I also rescued a baby squirrel and nurtured him into adulthood, turning the treehouse into his home.\nHis name was Squirmy, and he and my dog, Sadie, chased each other around for hours, bound by a mysterious agreement that neither would ever catch up to the other.\nBirds used to wait for me to put food on the bird feeder; they would line up on the wires overhead and descend as soon as I emerged from the house with a bag of seed.\nThe sweet memories are the ones I have retained, the ones that have bubbled to the surface after nearly six years. But when I abandoned my home, left it as if my life depended on escape, it was because I couldn't find the sweetness. I believed that, in fact, my life did depend on escape.\nMy career, my personal life, my internal landscapes all seemed war-torn and embattled. Rather than turning inward, I thought moving--changing my physical locale--would magically fix what was wrong. I had conveniently forgotten the wise observation that wherever you go, there you are.\nI was so committed to moving to the East Coast that I put my house up for sale in a declining market--a foolish move that proved costly. That's why I think of it as abandonment of something I should have treasured, why I look back on it as running away. So much was lost.\nFor years, I have punished myself for that decision. Even though living in New York for a few years was a positive, nourishing experience, I took my inner turbulence with me. What is so clear to me now--but wasn't then--is that moving forward in my life meant traveling inward; I could have done it in Manhattan or in Los Angeles, but I had to do it.\nI have now moved across the country twice. I have ended up back in Los Angeles, a happier person, a bit wiser, definitely calmer. I had to find in myself the writer I wanted to be, I had to repair the fractures in my family relationships first in my heart, and I had to address the fact that if I was drawn to bad romances, these could be found anywhere.\nGeography really had little or nothing to do with it. However, there is the home I lost, ran away from, really; there is the weight of a rash, immature choice, a hard memory.\nI don't live too far now from what was once my home, and I would like to live closer; I miss that neighborhood. The property itself has changed. The new owners added on to the house, removed some of the pines that shaded the garden. But two trees that I planted as saplings are now massive. It will never be the same as it was--only in my memory, and I have been dragging my memory behind me like a ball and chain.\nMy father used to tell me that God will give us an answer to any problem, dilemma or wound we bring him. \"If you ask God, he will answer you,\" my father would tell me. Here's something I've learned: Sometimes God answers us through other people.\nA friend of mine who was my neighbor when I lived in my tree-shaded house spoke the words I needed to hear. I confided to her that my decision to sell is still so difficult for me to cope with, to get beyond.\n\"Wait a minute here,\" she said. \"I was there for all that. I remember everything you were going through. You were unhappy, you were restless, and you felt if you moved, things might get better. You didn't set out to sabotage your life, you were trying to make it better. It's true that the cost was high, but look how you've grown as a person.\"\nI felt chains dropping off; I felt my memory stretching to take in the entire picture. I did what I thought I needed to do at the time. And there will be another home, another garden, which I will be better able to maintain as a peaceful, calm environment.\nWe lose places in our lives, but we leave things behind also. I planted two skinny saplings on land that I loved, that was my home for five years. They now bend over the lawn and reach to the sky; their trunks are thick and sturdy.\nAnd I learned an invaluable lesson. I learned that no matter how far, how fast I ran, I couldn't run away from myself. I learned it by trying to run, by trying to escape from myself in another city, another state, as if miles and jet streams were the answers. Maybe I couldn't have learned it any other way.\nMy friend was right, the cost was high. But there will be another home, and it will match the home I have found inside myself.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T15:12:11Z","url":"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-23-cl-25486-story.html"}

Now her friends and family in Wyoming, Ill., are honoring the sacrifice she made to save her newborn daughter, reports KWQC. Carter, who had just turned 21 on Sunday, was alone with her baby Monday morning when their house went up in flames. The local fire chief says Carter strapped Keana into a car seat and dropped her from an upstairs window, saving her life. \"You put yourself in that situation and you know it wouldn't be easy,\" says Stacy Unhold, a family friend. Carter was found near an upstairs window, and an autopsy determined she died of smoke inhalation.\nVery brave of this woman and proves a mother's love and sacrifice!

She might have been able to toss her newborn far enough away from the house, but then was scared to jump herself if flames were directly below her. Maybe the windowsill was too hot to climb out of?

{"text":"What can poetry do when faced with the daily realities of war and hatred, violence and terror, the crimes that humans enact upon each other and on the Earth? A cynic would answer nothing, would condemn the personal lyric as pure solipsism, an indulgence for the privileged few. But many 21st century poets are wrestling with questions of justice, writing at the intersection of history and intimacy, weaving political and social truth-telling into their private experiences.\nRobert Pinsky defended his art while serving as poet laureate: “I think poetry is a vital part of our intelligence, our ability to learn, our ability to remember, the relationship between our bodies and minds,” he told the Christian Science Monitor. Bay Area poets Solmaz Sharif and Tess Taylor prove this claim, help us learn and remember with their vital new collections.\nSharif’s astonishing debut Look (Graywolf Press; $16) examines an endless cycle of war and violence, using a myriad of voices and forms. A formidable poetic talent, Sharif was born in Istanbul to Iranian parents, activists who fled their home country after the Iranian Revolution.\nThe phrases in all caps are taken from the U.S. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, a sinister document that Sharif has studied in depth. “Look’s” central project is to interrogate the words themselves, to reveal how the terminology of war is entrenched in our language. She cites some of the Dictionary’s nearly 6,000 definitions and then remakes her own, splicing them into longer poems: “PINPOINT TARGET one lit desk lamp/ and a nightgown walking past the window,” “DAMAGE AREA does not include night sweats/ or retching at the smell of barbeque.” For the reader, these capitalized words and their visceral new meanings enact a series of small shocks, felt in the body and the mind.\nFar from the sites of violence, Bay Area native Tess Taylor chronicles a farming year in her radiant second collection, Work & Days (Red Hen Press; $11.95). Awarded the prestigious Amy Clampitt Fellowship, Taylor balances solitary poem making in “an old lady’s cottage” with intensive physical work at a local veggie farm. Taylor led youth garden programs in Berkeley and interned in the kitchen at Chez Panisse before digging into poetry, and her keen sense of place and love of food pervade these poems.\nholds code, waiting warmth to speak it.\nDespite global warming, famine and flood, Taylor captures delight and seeks hope, observes “a thumb-sized frog” singing its “short springtime song.” She celebrates the summer solstice, the apex of the year when “light is monument to its own passing” and turns her fine powers of description to mulching garlic, planting leeks, digging potatoes, making apple butter.\nMay those who are hungry be fed.\nMay those who have food also hunger for justice.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T21:12:14Z","url":"https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Poetry-by-Solmaz-Sharif-and-Tess-Taylor-9122762.php"}

{"text":"The Cats have wrapped up on the field for the day--and a sweltering one it was----and here are a couple of observations that my pal Drew probably would have had out there a lot earlier, but he's enjoying a well-deserved day off.\n* The Cats are fast. Flat out, no modifiers.\n*The defence is so far ahead of last year at this point that it's useless to even try to compare. Huge defensive plays made several times by both Rico Murray and Pawel Kruba at linebacker. Some guys who made starts last year will not make this team, is our guess.\n*The Canadian depth of this team is ridiculously good, and we'll address that a bit in the main column today (which is about Ted Laurent).\n* Obviously, as the top of the five-man quarterback pyramid, Zach Collaros got the A reps in team and \"skelly\" sessions in Monday's second day of Tiger-Cat training camp. The bulk of the rest of the reps went to Jeremiah Masoli, No. 3 on the depth chart last year.\n\"The quarterbacks understand that there isn't enough time to get reps for them each day,\" explained head coach Ken Austin of the way pivot assignments will be handled in training camp. \"We don't have enough reps to distribute five deep, or even four deep.\n\"Sometimes there is a modification, though, because we do things by concept. So if a quarterback is short of reps on a certain concept, then we have to rotate it differently to make sure that he comes up to curve in some learning, where he didn't have enough reps.\n\"There is a lot that goes into it each night as we plan reps.\"\nHere's part of the plan, we'll guess: Collaros gets every rep he needs, especially with the prospect of a strike/lockout which could cost precious development time for a guy trying to go from a seven-game No. 2, to an 18-game No. 1.\n*Andy Fantuz has never held for a left-footed kicker. Justin Medlock returns to the team after a two-year NFL absence and, apparently, is still kicking with his left foot.\nFantuz said it's an adjustment because Medlock is not only left-footed, he does not use a kicking tee---Medlock says that's actually easier for a holder once he gets used to it---and because unlike other kickers Medlock does not like the ball held down from the top with one or two fingers or the whole hand, but likes the tip of the ball pinched between forefinger and thumb to make it easier to rotate, if necessary.\nMedlock says it'll take 200 practice snaps to get it right but will he have that with Fantuz, who's a first-stringer on offence?\nNo, it says here. That's one reason why Jason Boltus, third-string quarterback, was his holder here before. Receivers Luke Tasker and Corey Koch both with reliable, and big, hands like Fantuz are also asking for practice time as holder.\n*Austin was asked whether he'd like to carry five quarterbacks as he did last year.\n\"We're trying to push to about eight or nine,\" he quipped before adding. \"I don't know. if there's a ned to do that we will.\"\n* And how is Collaros making out in his adaptation to the Austin Way, which requires an awful lot of conceptual knowledge and reaction to what's playing out in front of him?\n\"He's improving a lot,\" Austin said. \" It doesn't matter what new system you go into, there's new terminology. It's like Greek af first. First you have to get comfortable with the terminology then you have to understand WHY we're doing what we're doing, and not just what. You can't have a robotic memory, coming out on this football field, you have to learn conceptually because of our adjustments. That takes time to sink in, but Zach's doing agreat job right now in his understanding and progression of learning.\"\nTed doesn't only look big he plays big.\nMasoli (well, Austin's brilliance) got us home field advantage last year.\nWhat a difference a gm makes. Old picked up other teams castoffs. Even Glenn was cut even before training camp in Peg. Before comming here as saviour. New: even last years starters might not make team ?! Wow. From replacing garbage with garbage to replacing starters with stars!!\nAnd fast! I was wondering how our new QB was doing myself, even after only 2 days so thanks for addressing it, Mr Steve!\n2014: the Year of the Cats!\nIt is truly great to hear (but I'm not really surprised) that the Ticats are way ahead of where they were last season. Continuity of coaching staff and keeping the core of players together will do that. With a new QB, offense could take a bit longer to come together but then that was true last year when EVERYONE was learning a new system. Great to hear too that there is lots of speed, some of which was evident at times last season.\nAs for Medlock's holder - I would think that they might try out someone who is NOT a first string player. Last year when Fantuz was injured Congi had to adjust to a different holder (Bartel). Of course any player could be injured during the season, but using a backup (like they did with Boltus - maybe Lauther would work?) might avoid the possibility of having to substitute someone less familiar (or completely unfamiliar) with Medlock's style in case of injury.\nThe man just known as Ted.\n@Ryan y - How well he's coming along? It's Day 2 of camp... isn't it a little early to be asking that? We heard a bit of feedback after the OTA, but still, what else is a coach supposed to say at this point? And what are reporters supposed to be noticing when the drills have just been getting under way?\nRe: holders for placekicking, I'm curious about the thinking behind continuing to use a receiver to do the job, versus one of the backup QBs - they can certainly run the ball if the snap is botched, but you'd think having someone like Masoli or LeFevour doing it would open up more options on a broken placekick.\nIs it just me or are the ticats and reporters Being VERY careful about raising the fans expectations about how well Collaros is coming along? There have no articles about how great he is doing and Kent Austin gives the same cookie cutter responses whenever a reporter asks. I don't know maybe I've gotten used to the nfls reporters and their hyperbole over the off season but it scares me. This guy played one very bad preseason game last year I remember thinking wow he's terrible and lost the backup job to the argos Harris. I'm not sure how he ended up being second string again when Ricky went down but this kid is a HUGE gamble. And I think people should start to gear back the expectations a bit about a return to and winning the grey cup this year I think this kid might need a year or two to learn the game and become what all his potential says he could be.\nCould have used Laurent last year! Should have used the Gaydosh pick to get him! Oh well, better late than never.\nAlso agree that speed is good... Just look at how dangerous our STs were when Thigpen or Williams were returning the kicks for TDs.\nI haven't had a chance to get to camp yet... So will rely on others... How does Plesius look at MLB?\nGlad to hear team is fast; as many coaches have said \"you can't coach/teach speed\".\nNot surprised Masoli is 2nd QB (so far). I think he adds a quite different dimension to Ticat offence, whereas Lefevour is very similar in skills to Collaros.\nSigning of Laurent is huge, Ticats will have so many ratio options this year.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T08:00:47Z","url":"https://scratchingpost.thespec.com/2014/06/second-day-of-ticat-camp-and-the-rain-held-off.html"}
{"text":"The formation of the new federation would result in a major Cosatu split as affiliates would have to choose between the two.\nZwelinzima Vavi, the former Cosatu secretary general who was fired by Africa’s largest labour federation in 2014 for allegedly failing to carry out his duties, will lead the new federation to be unveiled on May 1.\nOne of Cosatu’s major affiliates – the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) – would be one of the biggest members of the federation. Numsa’s Cosatu membership was nullified in 2014 following disagreements with the federation.\nVavi said the South African trade union movement had become fragmented and weakened, with only 24 percent of workers being members of any union.\n“That is why there is such a groundswell of support for a workers summit and not just a new union federation but a fundamentally different one, based on worker control, internal democracy, non-racialism, gender equality, international solidarity and political independence,” he said.\nVavi said the new federation would shy away from politics and concentrate on representing interests of workers. Cosatu is part of South Africa’s ruling alliance with the African National Congress.\n“Workers are crying out for an independent, fighting of organisation that works with the civil society that have ties with other trade unions fighting the same course all over the world that are not just politically independent,” he said.\nA number of Cosatu affiliates including the Food and Allied Workers Union, South African Football Players Union, South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union, and Public and Allied Workers Union of South Africa are some of the unions that have been linked to Vavi’s initiative.\nSolidarity’s Gideon du Plesssis said the new federation had been trying to lure his union but they had ideological differences.\n“The founders have already been flirting with Solidarity for quite a while to win the union’s support and cooperation but on account of ideological and other differences, Solidarity will not join the federation; yet, in areas where we could share interests such as campaigns against corruption, electricity crises and service delivery, the new federation may certainly count on our support,” he wrote for Biznews.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T00:11:23Z","url":"https://www.theafricareport.com/1804/south-africas-biggest-labour-federation-splits/"}

{"text":"Courtesy Redwood City. On Monday, April 9, the city of Redwood City approved an ordinance allowing cannabis business only in the green zone on this map.\nRedwood City is open for cannabis business, but marijuana operators aren’t particularly high about the terms.\nAs far as they’re concerned, the city is banishing them to the industrial side of town and imposing overly restrictive rules.\nAt its Monday night meeting, the City Council voted 5-2 — with Jeffrey Gee and Vice Mayor Diane Howard dissenting — to approve an ordinance that establishes a zone where recreational marijuana wholesale businesses and indoor commercial-use nurseries can operate. That zone encompasses Seaport Boulevard east of Highway 101 and some areas west of the freeway on Veterans Boulevard. That’s where medical marijuana businesses before them primarily were relegated to.\nCity planners say those areas have a 3.89 percent vacancy rate, a fact they considered to be enticing to businesses.\nUnder the ordinance, the nurseries can only grow marijuana seeds, clones and immature plants and sell them just to wholesalers or commercial businesses, not individuals. They must provide 24-hour security and cannot operate within 1,000 feet of schools, youth centers, public parks and libraries. The state only requires them to be a minimum of 600 feet from schools.\nIn addition to medical marijuana deliveries that began in 2012, the ordinance allows recreational marijuana deliveries to businesses that obtain a business license in the city.\nKali-Rai, who also is a paid consultant for Harvest Bloom, one of the medical marijuana companies established in San Carlos with an administrative office in Redwood City. He said the company is worried it’ll have to comply with the new zoning rules if it expands into the recreational marijuana business.\nHarvest Bloom owner/operator Alex Gillis explained the concern.\nHe asked if a business like his could be grandfathered in.\nAlso at issue for local cannabis proprietors was the rule in the ordinance requiring 24-hour security for businesses.\nBusiness permits should begin to be issued this summer.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T22:32:00Z","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/11/redwood-city-allows-cannabis-business-in-east-end-of-town/"}

Tonight we’re following Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as they face off on the CNN debate stage in Flint, Michigan. Check back here to see who gets vindicated and who gets Berned when moderator Anderson Cooper questions the Dems on Flint’s water crisis, mass incarceration, and the state of the auto industry. But really, can we just have a moment of thanks for a debate where neither candidate references the size of his or her junk?\nI suppose they can trust the corporations who have destroyed Flint by a disastrous trade policy which have allowed them to shut down plants in Flint and move to China and Mexico.

We know their honesty and integrity has done so much for the American people.\nThey should be relieved. They failed this city.\nI am also going to go after companies. When a company decides to leave like Nabisco is leaving, [and] they have gotten tax benefits from Chicago and Illinois to stay there, I will claw back the benefits.\nI am very glad, Anderson, that secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue. But it’s a little bit too late. Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.\nI have said and I will say again, I will be happy to release anything I have as long as everybody else does too.\nWhen I was a young man at the University of Chicago, I worked with students trying to desegregate University of Chicago-owned housing.

I got to know them. I listened to them. It has been incredibly humbling, because I can’t pretend to have had the experience you and others have had.\nNo. I do not support fracking.\nWe have our differences and we get into vigorous debate about issues. But compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican stage last week.\nLet me pick up on the last point the secretary made. We [the Democrats] are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money into mental health. When you watch these Republican debates, you know why.\nMy father’s family was wiped out by Hitler in the Holocaust. I know about what crazy and radical and extremist politics mean. I learned that lesson as a tiny, tiny child when my mother would take me shopping, and we would see people working in stores who had numbers on their arms because they were in Hitler’s concentration camps. I’m very proud of being Jewish, and that’s an essential part of who I am.\nI am a praying person. And if I hadn’t been during the time I was in the White House, I would have become one—because it’s very hard to imagine living under that kind of pressure without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.\nThis post will be updated throughout the night.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T17:04:29Z","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2016/03/best-lines-of-the-night-from-the-cnn-news-democratic-debate.html"}

If you thought the financial crisis had given capitalism a bad name, election results show E.U. politicians have done their part as well.\nIn Spain, the standing socialist government lost seats to its conservative opposition and acknowledged \"the warning\" sent to them by voters concerned about the economy. At 18.1 percent, Spain has the highest unemployment rate in Europe.\nThough the next presidential election in Spain is three years away, La Vanguardia reports that Rafael Rajoy, the leader of the conservative party and a presidential hopeful, is calling for a vote of no confidence against President José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.\nThe Right made its mark in other national contests as well.\nBritain's Conservative party outperformed Labour making it even more difficult for the embattled Gordon Brown to reassure supporters he can survive the calls for his resignation. Labour took third in the E.U. election behind Ukip whose platform calls for the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U.\nSince the rejection of the E.U. Constitution four years ago, Europe has been searching for a way forward. The elections, however, show that the popular attitude toward the E.U. is more skeptical than ever with only a 43 percent turnout, the lowest in the history of the Parliament.\nIn an interview for Le Monde Denish MacShane, Minister of European Affairs under Tony Blair, said that we are witnessing a \"renationalisation of Europe.\"\n\"Europeans are afraid, afraid for their work, their salary, their standard of living, the future for their children.

Rupert Jones, deputy commander, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve told reporters yesterday.\nIn a teleconferenced feed from Baghdad, Jones said the coalition’s training of Iraqi forces has been key in the campaign to defeat ISIL. “It’s been well over a year since [ISIL] last defeated an Iraqi force, although they continue to resist,” he said, noting that more than 4,500 forces are training now to sustain the Iraqi forces and establish wide-area security and holding forces when Mosul has been retaken.\n“We’re a coalition of more than 60 nations, united against [ISIL]. And we’re very proud that so many have offered contributions to fight against [ISIL’s] twisted ideology here in Iraq, in Syria, and other locations around the world,” he said.\nThe coalition has trained more than 63,000 fighters and many are in combat operations in Mosul and other locations around Iraq, he said.\nThe OIR deputy commander said the Iraqi forces continue to progress in their advance on Mosul, and while ISIL has lost significant amounts of territory in the city’s eastern sector, the enemy has used snipers and indirect fire, mortars and rockets “to terrorize civilians in areas that have been ripped away from their control. They’ve also used suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices to attack the advancing Iraqi security forces,” he said.\nIn response, and at the Iraqi government’s request, U.S.-led coalition forces struck and disabled four of the five bridges connecting east and west Mosul, and increased terrain-denial missions, Jones said.\n“The intent of these operations is to reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. This combination of the two tactics seems to be reducing the number of VBIEDs the enemy has been able to use,” he said.\nSurrounded by a superior coalition force, the enemy has little ability to resupply or reinforce their fighters, he said, adding since the counterattack to liberate Mosul began Oct. 17, the coalition has relentlessly bombarded the enemy.\n“The coalition has supported the Iraqi advance with more than 4,800 precision bombs, artillery shells, missiles and rockets against [ISIL] fighters and resources,” he added.\nIn Syria, the Syrian Democratic Forces having recaptured more than 270 square miles of terrain from ISIL, and are planning the next phase of isolation of Raqqa, Jones said.\n“They’re now less than [18 miles] from the city and have encountered light to moderate resistance as they continue clearing villages along the axis of advance,” Jones said.\nThe SDF is also back-clearing the areas they control to reduce ISIL’s ability to reinfiltrate or attack using sleeper cells. “The coalition continues supporting their operations with air strikes, having delivered more than 600 munitions onto enemy targets,” he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T12:08:48Z","url":"https://www.enewspf.com/national-news/latest-national-news/iraqi-forces-make-remarkable-turnaround-operation-inherent-resolve-official-says/"}
{"text":"The Jeep Grand Cherokee is one of the brightest stars among the cars that propelled Chrysler--now controlled by Fiat--to a 26-percent sales increase in 2011, raising its share of the U.S. market 1.3 points to 10.7 percent.\nYesterday, the company said it would start building a diesel version of the Grand Cherokee next year, its first diesel passenger vehicle in several years.\nThat confirms a statement by Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne from last April that the popular Jeep crossover would get a diesel option, which he reiterated in October.\nThe new clean-diesel sport-utility vehicle was buried in an announcement that Chrysler would add a third production shift at its Jefferson North assembly plant in Detroit next year, hiring 1,100 new workers in the process.\nThat plant now builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, and will eventually add low-volume production of a Maserati sport-utility vehicle previewed by the Kubang concept at the Frankfurt Motor Show last fall.\nThere's already a diesel version of the Grand Cherokee built in the plant, mind you, but it's sold only in Europe, where diesel vehicles make up roughly 50 percent of new-car sales. It was unveiled last spring at the Geneva Motor Show, using a turbodiesel engine from VM Motori.\nThe European version has a 3.0-liter V-6 diesel offered in two different states of tune. The more powerful has 241 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque, the lesser version is rated at 190 horsepower and 325 pound-feet.\nThe more powerful version accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 8.2 seconds, and is rated at 28.4 mpg on the European test cycle. That testing procedure usually returns fuel efficiency figures about 20 percent higher than the U.S. test, so we might expect combined fuel economy of 23 or 24 mpg.\nThe most economical current version of the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee, fitted with the brand's Pentastar 3.6-liter V-6 gasoline engine and a five-speed automatic transmission, is rated by the EPA at 19 mpg combined for its rear-wheel drive model.\nAnd the Grand Cherokee is likely to be the first of many clean diesel models sold across the Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge brands. A turbodiesel Dodge Durango crossover, built on the same underpinnings as the Jeep crossover, would be easy. Analysts say that the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger large sedans will also get oil burners.\nClean-diesel vehicles are now sold in the U.S. only by four European brands: Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen, with the bulk of those sales coming from the mass-market VW Jetta TDI and Golf TDI models.\nBut Porsche just announced it would sell its Cayenne Diesel luxury sport-utility vehicle this year in the States.\nThe first U.S. brand to offer a new diesel passenger car may be Chevrolet, which will sell a Cruze diesel compact sedan for the 2013 model year.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T12:15:52Z","url":"https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1071385_jeep-grand-cherokee-diesel-sport-utility-coming-in-2013"}
{"text":"Taking a deeper look into the list of recipients of political parties' protection money* in 2019, it appears as though a significant portion thereof will be going to nonprofits connected to party members.\nThe list of recipients of the protection money being distributed by the three coalition parties includes sports associations, village societies, schools, kindergartens and churches. Of the three parties, Centre and Pro Patria are the most generous toward churches, earmarking funds for the renovation of a whole host of houses of worship; the Social Democratic Party (SDE), meanwhile, will be supporting the renovation of just a few.\nIt stands out, however, that parties are not planning on missing the opportunity to use allotted protection money to give a boost to their members' nonprofits.\nFor example, one of the Centre Party's largest planned financial contributions, totalling €100,000, is to go to the nonprofit Tööstuspark Intec-Nakro, one of the two board members of which is a member of the Centre Party — Narva city councilmember Fjodor Ovsjannikov, who has been convicted of corruption.\nCentre's contribution of €50,000 to the nonprofit Voore made the news last year as Voore board member Kristjan Sakk is partners with Centre Party member Ekri Savisaar. The nonprofit is slated to receive another cash injection from the ruling party, which has earmarked €17,000 for the development of a 3D marketing platform for manors.\nAnother €50,000 in operational support has been earmarked for the Estonian Tenants' Union, on the board of which serve Centre Party members Urmi Reinde and Heimar Lenk.\n€12,000 is to go to the nonprofit Talendipank, the board of which includes Centre members Sten-Erik Jantson and Tiina Jantson. According to its annual report, the nonprofit organises beauty pageants.\nThe Viisu Village Society, on which serves Centre Party member and Paide City Council chairman Aivar Tubli, is to receive €20,000 for the reconstruction of a park.\nThe Centre Party has also earmarked €5,000 for Jõgeva Hospital, whose director, Peep Põdder, is not only a member of the party himself, but the personal doctor of former longtime Centre Party chairman Edgar Savisaar.\nOf Pro Patria's protection money, €100,000 is to go to the nonprofit Konstantin Päts Museum with the aim of erecting a monument to Päts. Three of the nonprofit's five board members are members of Pro Patria, including Trivimi Velliste.\n€50,000 is going toward the development of the cooperation network of the Society of Villages of Taheva Municipality. This nonprofit's sole board member, Monika Rogenbaum, is a member of Pro Patria. Another €50,000 is to go to the nonprofit Rõuge Sports Club, two board members of which, Jaak Pächter and Oliver Ossipov, are likewise members of Pro Patria.\nThe nonprofit Kalev Yacht Club, whose board includes Pro Patria member Kalev Vapper is to receive €25,000 for the renovation of its port infrastructure. The Jaan Tõnisson Institute, whose sole board member Andrus Villem is likewise a member of the party, is to receive the same amount.\nPro Patria member Tiit Salvan serves on the board of the nonprofit Toila-Ontika Merekuurort, which is to receive €23,000 for community facilities and €10,000 for solar-powered bus station lighting.\nThe Hiiumaa Heritage Society, on the board of which serves Pro Patria member and local municipal council member Tiit Harjak, is to receive €15,000 for the planning of a local War of Independence monument.\nThe Social Democratic Party (SDE), meanwhile, has earmarked €36,000 for the Tartu County Farmers' Union, whose director is SDE member Jaan Sõrra. Another €45,000 is to go to the Tilsi Stadium Foundation, whose board includes SDE member Sirje Tobreluts.\nThe Tartu County Central Folklore Association, whose board includes Social Democrat Ants Johanson, is to receive €10,000 for the renovation and purchase of premises. The nonprofit Väike Väin Society, on whose board serve SDE members Andres Hanso and Heiki Hanso, is likewise to receive €10,000, which is to pay for an environmental analysis.\nAlso to receive €10,000 each are the Vaiatu Village Society, whose board includes SDE member Mati Kepp, Sõmerpalu Care Home, whose sole board member is Social Democrat Lenhard Ermel, and the Estonian Nordic Walking Union, whose board includes SDE member Rein Randver.\nNo such striking ties were detected in the recipients of the opposition parties' financial contributions. The Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) divided its total of €300,000 evenly between the Hille Tänavsuu Cancer Treatment Foundation, the Estonian Women's Shelters Union and the Tartu University Hospital Children's Foundation.\nThe Free Party had a total of €227,000 in protection money to distribute, and only one recipient, the nonprofit Pelgulinn Society, had party members also serving on its board. The neighbourhood society is to receive €8,000 in support for the purchase of inventory as well as operational subsidies.\nThe Reform Party rejected its portion of protection money.\n*This distribution of funds referred to in Estonian as katuseraha — protection money — goes back to the 1990s. A certain amount of money was reserved to be allocated at the discretion of the Riigikogu's members to satisfy different parties' interests. The arrangement is still in place, discussed towards the end of every year, and acts as a sort of grease in the process of getting a majority for the state budget bill.\nParty protection money: storm in a teacup or embarrassing anachronism?","timestamp":"2019-04-26T14:27:54Z","url":"https://news.err.ee/882311/parties-generous-in-handing-out-protection-money-to-members-nonprofits"}
{"text":"LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The pesticide glyphosate, sold by Monsanto in its Roundup weed killer product and widely used in agriculture and by gardeners, is unlikely to cause cancer in people, according to a new safety review by United Nations health, agriculture and food experts.\nIn a statement likely to intensify a row over its potential health impact, experts from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) said glyphosate is “unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans” exposed to it through food. It is mostly used on crops.\nHaving reviewed the scientific evidence, the joint WHO/FAO committee also said glyphosate is unlikely to be genotoxic in humans. In other words, it is not likely to have a destructive effect on cells’ genetic material.\nDiazinon and malathion, two other pesticides reviewed by the committee, which met last week and published its conclusions on Monday, were also found to be unlikely to be carcinogenic.\n“In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet,” the committee said.\nGlyphosate is also “unlikely to be genotoxic at anticipated dietary exposures”, it added.\nThe group reaffirmed an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of up to 1 milligram of glyphosate for every kilogram of body weight.\nThe conclusions appear to contradict a finding by the WHO’s Lyon-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which in March 2015 said glyphosate is “probably” able to cause cancer in humans and classified it as a ‘Group 2A’ carcinogen.\nSeven months after the IARC review, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), an independent agency funded by the European Union, published a different assessment, saying glyphosate is “unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans”.\nThe United States’ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which first assessed glyphosate in 1986 and has reviewed it several times since then, had also previously concluded it has “low toxicity for humans”.\nThe differing findings thrust glyphosate into the centre of a row involving EU and U.S. politicians and regulators, the IARC experts, the WHO and environmental and agricultural scientists.\nThe EU’s pesticides committee is due to meet later this week to decide whether to re-license glyphosate. The U.S. EPA is being investigated for withdrawing a report saying the chemical is probably not carcinogenic.\nIn a question-and-answer document issued alongside the joint FAO/WHO statement, the WHO denied that the conclusions by the joint group and by IARC were contradictory. It said they were “different, yet complementary”, with the IARC assessment focussed on hazard while the other looked at risk.\nIn contrast, it said, the joint FAO/WHO committee looks at published and unpublished studies to assess the health risk to consumers from dietary exposure to pesticide residues in food.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T04:33:09Z","url":"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-who-glyphosate-idUSKCN0Y71HR"}

{"text":"Too many potions muddle the alchemy in \"The Great Magician,\" a picaresque romance set around the rivalry between a warlord and a conjurer in 1920s China.\nToo many potions muddle the alchemy in “The Great Magician,” a picaresque romance set around the rivalry between a warlord and a conjurer in 1920s China. Absent the psychological tension, technical showmanship and stylistic sleight-of-hand of “The Prestige,” this yarn from Hong Kong writer-helmer Derek Yee is unable to harmonize a mix of political intrigue and vaudevillian humor, while an excess of magic acts keeps the sterling cast too physically busy to breathe feeling into their roles. Out of touch with contempo urban tastes, the pic is unlikely to conjure dazzling B.O. in China or satisfy overseas cravings for martial arts-centric titles.\nNorthern China in the ’20s is embroiled in territorial feuds between warlords, one of whom is is Lei Daniu, aka Bully (Sean Lau Ching-wan), who uses the mentalist skills of his butler, Liu Kunshan (Wu Gang), to recruit soldiers. Bully is besotted with pretty acrobat Yin (Zhou Xun), whom he captured and forcibly made his seventh concubine while her fiance was in Europe. Meanwhile, Yin’s magician father, Liu Wanyao (the helmer’s brother, Paul Chun), has disappeared.\nWhen the mysterious Zhang Xian (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) arrives in Beijing to stage spectacular magic shows, Bully seeks his help to impress the frosty Yin. To his consternation, the suave and Westernized Zhang is more beguiling than he bargained for.\nased on Zhang Haifan’s novel of the same title, the screenplay by Yee, Chun Tin-nam and Lau Ho-leung plays down the book’s dramatization of the cultural encounter between Western and Eastern magic. In fact, more plot similarities can be found with Neil Burger’s “The Illusionist,” though without that film’s sustained mystique and ingenious plotting. Yin’s divided affections never build to a full-blown romantic triangle; the main trio’s first encounter arrives a leisurely half-hour after the scene is set and periphery characters are introduced. The midsection, in which Bully and Zhang try to suss each other out, coasts on the playful charm of the two actors, but delivers no high-concept feats. Eventually, the lead story is overtaken by inane subplots involving a lost alchemy formula, Japanese spies masquerading as filmmakers, and a Manchurian monarchist conspiracy.\nThe pic attempts to re-create the rapture of spectatorship in an era when magic appears as powerful as sorcery to a more gullible public. It works initially, such as when Zhang plays with fire or nimbly manipulates silk-screen paintings to re-enact his romantic past. However, rather than focusing on a few grand setpieces, the film features wall-to-wall magic, some of which is purely gimmicky, which inevitably strips it of mystery.\nAn exploration of magic and cinema as parallel mediums, capable of enchanting as well as deluding the masses, has as much relevance now as it did in ’20s China, which also featured a burgeoning economy that bred unprecedented avarice and, with it, new levels of con artistry. Yee tentatively reflects on this phenomenon, but his tendency to moralize (obvious also in his “Protege” and “Shinjuku Incident”) brings the film to a banal conclusion.\nPerfs are sound but not exceptional. Leung, who last graced the screen in 2009’s “Red Cliff II,” looks a bit old for the Casanova role, and is initially rather wooden; he doesn’t warm up until he’s left alone to banter with Lau. Gamine Zhou easily convinces as a femme to die for, but doesn’t invite deeper examination of her character or thoughts. Lau offers the most consistent turn as a wild card who keeps one guessing about his true nature until the end. Supporting turns by Wu (who had so much more presence in “Ip Man”) and Yan (brassy as usual), plus cameos by Daniel Wu, Alex Fong and Tsui Hark, only mildly enhance the mix.\nVisual effects are refined without being tastelessly showy, and Yee Chung-man’s costumes are stylishly color-coordinated with the lush decor. Production design and lighting look particularly rich and luminous, paying loving homage to the folksy northern ambience and studio-set look of Li Han-hsiang’s 1970s warlord comedy-satires and trickster capers.\nStephen Tung Wai’s action choreography serviceably integrates magic into martial arts, but larger-scale street fights are pedestrian.\nProduction: An Emperor Motion Picture (in Hong Kong), Bona Entertainment Co.

{"text":"REPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): For President Putin if I could follow up as well. Why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election given the evidence that US Intelligence agencies have provided? Will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a US Grand jury.\nTRUMP: Well I’m going to let the president [meaning Putin] answer the second part of that question.\nAs you know, the concept of that came up perhaps a little before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election, which frankly, they should have been able to win, because the electoral college is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. [That allegation from Trump is unsupported, and could well be false.] We won the electoral college by a lot. 306 to 223, I believe. [It was actually 304 to 227.] That was a well-fought battle. We did a great job.\nFrankly, I’m going to let the president speak to the second part of your question. But, just to say it one time again and I say it all the time, there was no collusion. I didn’t know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. Every time you hear all of these 12 and 14 — it’s stuff that has nothing to do — and frankly, they admit, these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they are saying, well maybe that does. It doesn’t. Even the people involved, some perhaps told mis-stories. In one case the FBI said there was no lie. There was no lie. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign. And that’s why I’m president. Thank you.\nPUTIN: As to who is to be believed, who is not to be believed: you can trust no one. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact.\nThere are issues where our postures diverge and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense — just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there’s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That’s the normal thing.\nPresident Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia/US relationship, and it’s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it and different people could express their sympathy in different ways. Isn’t that natural? Isn’t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?\nWe heard the accusations about it. As far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn’t have a fighting chance in the American courts. There’s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts, not by rumors.\nNow, let’s get back to the issue of this 12 alleged intelligence officers of Russia. I don’t know the full extent of the situation. But President Trump mentioned this issue. I will look into it.\nSo far, I can say the following. Things that are off the top of my head. We have an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999. The mutual assistance on criminal cases. This treaty is in full effect. It works quite efficiently. On average, we initiate about 100, 150 criminal cases upon request from foreign states.\nFor instance, the last year, there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. This treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer. The appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller, he can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal, official request to us so that we could interrogate, hold questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. Our enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller, we can let them into the country. They can be present at questioning.\nIn this case, there’s another condition. This kind of effort should be mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate. They would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence services of the United States whom we believe have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia. And we have to request the presence of our law enforcement.\nFor instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes. Neither in Russia nor in the United States. Yet, the money escapes the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. [He presents no evidence to back up that $400 million claim.] Well, that’s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself. But the way the money was earned was illegal. We have solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers guided these transactions. [This allegation, too, is merely an unsupported assertion here.] So we have an interest of questioning them. That could be a first step. We can also extend it. There are many options. They all can be found in an appropriate legal framework.\nREPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): Did you direct any of your officials to help him [Trump] do that [find those ‘options’]?\nPUTIN: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US/Russia relationship back to normal.\nThe evidence regarding that entire matter, of Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act, can be seen in the links and the other evidences that are presented in two articles that I published on that very subject, earlier this year. One, titled “Private Investigations Find America’s Magnitsky Act to Be Based on Frauds”, summarizes the independently done private investigations into the evidence that is publicly available online regarding Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act. The Magnitsky Act was the basis for the first set of economic sanctions against Russia, and were instituted in 2012; so, this concerns the start of the restoration of the Cold War (without the communism etc. that were allegedly the basis of Cold War I). The other article, “Russiagate-Trump Gets Solved by Giant of American Investigative Journalism”, provides further details in the evidence, and connects both the Magnitsky Act and Bill Browder to the reason why, on 9 June 2016, the Russian lawyer Nataliya Veselnitskaya, met privately at Trump Tower, with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner — the reason was specifically in order to inform them about the documentation on this case, so that Trump, if elected, would be aware of the contents of those documents. She had used the promise of dirt on Hillary so as to enable Trump, who effectively became the Republican nominee on 26 May 2016, to learn about the actual documents in this crucial case.\nThe Russian government has been legally pursuing Mr. Browder, for years, on charges that he evaded paying $232 million taxes that were due to the Russian government. These private investigations into this matter — regarding whether or not the Magnitsky Act was based on fraudulent grounds — have all found that Mr. Browder has clearly falsified and misrepresented the actual documents, which are linked to in those two articles I wrote. These might be the very same documents that she was presenting on June 9th.\nSo: this is a matter of importance not only to the validity (or not) of the Magnitsky Act economic sanctions against Russia, but to the Russiagate accusations regarding U.S. President Donald Trump. In my two articles, the general public can click right through to the evidence on the Magnitsky case.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T10:56:52Z","url":"https://countercurrents.org/2018/07/17/trumps-and-putins-responses-to-muellers-russiagate-indictments/"}

Macura, forward Kerem Kanter, forward Kaiser Gates, forward Sean O’Mara.\nWho’s back: Junior point guard Quentin Goodin (8.7 point per game) is Xavier’s most experienced returning player and will be one of the team’s leaders, along with sophomore forward Naji Marshall, who started 18 games last season. Marshall averaged 7.7 points and is Xavier’s most diverse offensive player. Forward Tyrique Jones (7 ppg, 4.5 rebounds) is counted on to play a bigger scoring role on the front line. Sophomore guard Paul Scruggs (4.9 ppg) also moves into an expanded role.\nWho’s new: Three graduate students.

Guard Kyle Castlin is a team captain after coming over from Columbia, where he averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.\nThe Skinny: Xavier is in a transition season with a new head coach and a significantly different roster. The Musketeers lost five of their top seven scorers including Bluiett, who averaged 19.3 points per game. Xavier was ranked as high as No. 3 last season, won its first Big East regular season title and got its first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament before blowing a 12-point lead and losing in the second round.

Defending national champion Villanova is one of the top favorites at 10-1.\nCINCINNATI (AP) — With a senior-laden team, Xavier won its first Big East regular season championship and got its first No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. A second-round loss abruptly ended everything and began a transition that’s still in progress entering the new season.\nCoach Chris Mack left for Louisville and was replaced by Travis Steele , his top assistant. Five of the top seven scorers are gone, including Trevon Bluiett, who averaged 19.3 point per game. And the Musketeers find themselves with a lot of newness as they open the Steele era.\nNo matter who was the head coach, the Musketeers would have been expected to take a step back because of the turnover from their 29-6 season. Their top three scorers were seniors Bluitt and J.P. Macura (12.9 points per game) and graduate transfer Kerem Kanter (10.9).\nWhat’s left is a roster with limited experience in Xavier’s system. Three graduate transfers will fill it out, but they have to get used to playing a different style.\nNEW LEADER: Goodin was among the players who lobbied for Steele to get the head coaching job, providing stability in the program. Steele is staying with Xavier’s offensive and defensive systems, though tweaking them to account for the significant roster change. Goodin said Steele has kept most things the same.\nTRIO OF GRADUATE TRANSFERS: Forward Zach Hankins set school records for blocked shots and field goal percentage at Ferris State. Guard Ryan Welage set the school record for 3-pointers in three seasons at San Jose State. Guard Kyle Castlin is a team captain after coming over from Columbia, where he averaged 10.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. All three are counted upon to play significant roles during their one season at Xavier.\nYOUNGER LEADERS: With no seniors who came up through Xavier’s program, the Musketeers are counting on Goodin, junior Tyrique Jones, and sophomores Naji Marshall and Paul Scruggs to provide more leadership as the newcomers learn their way.\nGETTING DEFENSIVE: Xavier’s defense slipped last season, often allowing teams to go on long runs that got them back into games. The perimeter defense was a problem in particular. Steele has tweaked the Musketeers’ man-to-man defense to try to get more turnovers and transition baskets.\nNEW BIG EAST LOOK: The top two teams in the league have undergone significant roster changes — Xavier the regular-season champion and Villanova the national champion.

{"text":"This image from Rethink81 shows what Almond Street might look like without the Interstate 81 viaduct. The CNY Chapter of the American Institute of Architects supports demolition of the highway in favor of a Community Grid plan that would bring life and commerce into spaces now in the shadow of the interstate.\nClose your eyes and visualize a mini Park Avenue in New York City, or Millennium Park in Chicago. These urban areas are pedestrian-friendly spaces with a mix of high-rises and street-level mixed-use properties. These locations, home to some of the most valuable real estate in the world, are also critical components of a city street grid.\nThe I-81 Viaduct Project is an opportunity for our region to think big. Not a big new highway, but grand and innovative ideas on what to do with the (hopefully) soon-to-be former viaduct corridor.\nSelecting the Community Grid option over replacing the current Viaduct with a newer, bigger highway should be a \"no-brainer.\" Removing the elevated highway will open up a range of opportunities for our region; to further reinvigorate the city, to reconnect divided communities and to stimulate unprecedented growth.\nSyracuse was one of many cities across the country which made the fateful urban planning decision in the 1950s and 1960s to build elevated highways through their urban centers. In every case, the neighborhoods in the shadows of the viaducts suffered a similar fate; abandonment and isolation, reduced property values, pollution and noise. Beyond the socio-economic impacts on neighborhoods, city highways severely limit economic development, and they are not terribly efficient, either. Have you ever been one of the 44,000 people a day who use Exit 18 (Harrison/Adams) during the morning and evening commute?\nToday, cities like San Francisco, New Orleans, Boston, Dallas and New Haven have already, or are in the process of, tearing down elevated city highways. In Milwaukee, where the Park East Freeway was razed in 1999, urban development has flourished with property values in the affected area increasing by 45 percent. In 2007, Manpower relocated its 900-employee global headquarters to a site in downtown Milwaukee formerly occupied by elevated the highway.\nThis can happen in Syracuse.\nThe economics favor the Community Grid option as well. The Grid costs $400 million less than the Viaduct, which also takes longer to build and requires increasing annual maintenance costs over the next 50-plus years. Equally important, the Community Grid stimulates economic growth. There is a need to re-densify the city, especially in walkable areas like those around Almond Avenue. Walkable zones attract people and development generating sales and property tax revenue. We have an opportunity to revitalize the valuable areas currently shadowed by I-81.\nIn addition to the community-building and economic development benefits, there are compelling logistics arguments for the Community Grid. Eighty-eight percent of the traffic on the existing viaduct consists of people travelling to the city - most for work. The current highway, however, is designed to help cars bypass the city altogether.\nThe Community Grid design taps into the existing infrastructure, dispersing traffic throughout the city grid by promoting broader use of the existing underutilized street network. The design provides direct connections to key destinations in the city and adds new exits to ease congestion and further spread traffic. In the grid, instead of one path to their destination, drivers will have multiple access points.\nThe grid design is also the least disruptive option, requiring the acquisition of just five buildings. The construction of a new Viaduct will condemn and demolish 24 buildings, including at least 12 structures of historical significance.\nThe American Institute of Architects Central New York chapter created the AIACNY81 Task Force in 2013 to carefully follow this process; to help broaden community knowledge and promote good design and planning practices. Based on our review of the current plans, we strongly recommend the Community Grid alternative, which would knit the city together again and offer unprecedented redevelopment potential.\nFor this process to be truly successful we must view this as more than just fixing a mistake, or designing a better traffic pattern. The Community Grid presents an urban development opportunity which will have a profound effect on our region for generations.\nSyracuse, Central New York and New York state must maximize this opportunity. Let's get this right with big ideas not a big new highway. We look forward to being an integral part of this important planning conversation.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T14:26:00Z","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2016/10/we_need_big_ideas_not_a_bigger_interstate_81_your_letters.html"}

{"text":"The Buzz: Palomar clearing land off Hilltop Drive. Here's why.\nThe Buzz: A piece of land off Hilltop Drive is getting cleared. Here's why.\nDirt, and lots of it, has been moving on a piece of hillside property off Mission De Oro Drive across from the Shasta Creek Apartments east of Interstate 5.\nThe work is visible from off north Hilltop Drive.\nPalomar Builders is grading land to build attached homes, much like its Park Pointe neighborhood just north of this site.\nBut this project has a twist.\nJeb Allen, Palomar’s co-owner, told me about 10 of the 46 units will have studio apartments where the garage would go. The apartments will have a bathroom and kitchen.\nAllen had tried to sell the property. But it's zoned multi-family, so Allen said nobody would buy it because the cost to build apartments didn't pencil out.\nSo, he came up with the studio apartment idea, which satisfies the requirement to build multi-family housing.\n“When I start something, I want to finish it, and to me this finishes Highland Park,” Allen said.\nHighland Park is the single-family subdivision next to Park Pointe that Palomar Builders started in 2009. Park Pointe is an extension of Highland Park.\nAllen said floorplans for his new development will range from 1,693 square feet to 2,021 square feet. The smallest floor plan will feature the 10 studio apartments.\nBut while Allen is satisfying the multi-family zoning requirement, the studio space doesn’t have to be an apartment.\nThe owner could turn it into say a man cave or she shack.\nAllen hopes to start construction in the spring.\nLily Toy, the city’s interim planning manager, said accessory units to homes are built throughout the city.\n“But as far building these all out as far as a planned development, yes this is probably a first,” Toy said.\nIf you’ve ever had an idea on how to make Redding a more desirable place to live and believe there are ways to attract more visitors to the area, the Redding City Identity Project wants to hear from you.\nThe project has posted a survey (https://bit.ly/2yKDi7n) of 16 questions that it will use to come up with 20 ideas by 2020.\nHow do you describe yourself?\nWhat challenges does Redding face?\nWhat are the three best assets of the city?\nWhat would you do within the next 10 years to affect positive change in Redding?\nYou have until Nov. 20 to take the survey and the results will be revealed Jan. 10 at the Cascade Theatre. The evening also will feature John O’Leary, who was badly burned when he was 9 years old and is now an inspirational speaker and author of the book, “On Fire.” O’Leary is the father of four and lives in St. Louis.\nThe chamber announced its $500,000 city pride plan last spring. It has partnered with other businesses and organizations to help fund the project, including the McConnell Foundation, Sierra Pacific Industries Foundation, Dignity Health, Black Bear Diner, Commerce Home Mortgage, Compass and Josh Barker of ReMax Town & Country.\nQuestions on the survey were based in part from meetings with artists, web designers, the startup business community, and city and Shasta County leaders.\n“This is not going to be the chamber of commerce version of the identity of Redding. This is coming from the people of the community, so we want it to be a far and wide reach,” Mangas said.\nIdeas to improve Redding should focus on messaging, experiences and aesthetics.\n“Maybe one idea is a façade improvement in Redding and maybe funding from the identity project gets leveraged with other dollars to make it happen,” Mangas said.\nThere were 500 responses about a day after the survey first went up.\n“It’s really fun to see how people have engaged for us,” Mangas said.\nThree months after its transmitter atop Shasta Bally was destroyed by the Carr Fire, 88.9 FM KFPR in Redding is still off the air.\nAnd North State Public Radio management does not know when the transmitter will be replaced so 88.9 can be back on the air.\nMeanwhile, North State Public Radio restored full power to its 91.7 KCHO station in Chico. The station once again can be heard between Yuba City and Redding, though reception in Redding can be spotty depending on where you’re at.\nKCHO had been broadcasting at reduced strength on a backup transmitter since April, when the transmitter on Cohasset overheated and failed due to a faulty air conditioning unit.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T23:01:24Z","url":"https://www.redding.com/story/money/columnists/david-benda/2018/11/02/buzz-palomar-clearing-land-off-hilltop-drive-heres-why/1851429002/"}

{"text":"Tens of thousands of people have been tortured and thousands have died in custody in Syria’s prisons since March 2011, the start of the crisis that has forced so many to flee.\nAnyone suspected of opposing the government is at risk. Labourers, business people, students, bloggers, university professors, lawyers, doctors and journalists. People helping their neighbours. Activists standing up for minority groups. Men, women and even children.\nPrisoners speak of an endless cycle of beatings. On the journey after arrest. In transit between detention centres. As part of a ‘welcome party’ of abuse on arrival at a prison, used to frighten new arrivals into submission. And then every day for every conceivable minor ‘breaking’ of rules, including talking or not cleaning their cells.\nMany of the people we spoke to said they had been beaten with plastic hose pipes, silicone bars and wooden sticks. Some had been scalded with hot water and burnt with cigarettes. Others were forced to stand in water and given electric shocks.\nPeople suffer acute mental health problems due to overcrowding and lack of sunlight. In some cases, people told us there could be more than 50 people in a cell as small as 3m by 3m. They sleep in shifts, and have a tiny space of floor where they can sit and eat.\nPeople die from starvation. From a lack of air in their cells. And from completely treatable diseases. Cuts, ingrown fingernails and rashes become infected, and people die from a desperate lack of medical care.\nIn most cases, the Syrian government denies the security forces have even arrested these people. Or they refuse to give any information about their whereabouts. It means that many detainees are “disappeared” – outside the protection of the law – making them especially vulnerable to abuse.\nThis is just part of the reality of life in Syria. And it’s part of the reason why so many people are fleeing for neighbouring countries and beyond. More than 11 million Syrians have fled their country since the start of the crisis.\nAs the world attempts to resolve the ongoing conflict, the treatment of people in detention must be a priority if Syrians are to have any trust in a lasting peace. Russia has considerable influence over negotiations, in part because of its military involvement in the region. It must ensure that independent monitors are allowed in to fully investigate conditions in these brutal detention centres.\nThe Syrian government must let in independent monitors to investigate Syria’s brutal detention centres, now.\nSince 2011, thousands of people have died in custody in Syria’s torture prisons. Tens of thousands more have experienced shocking torture. People have been brutally beaten, raped, given electric shocks and more, often to extract forced “confessions”. Anyone suspected of opposing the Syrian government is at risk. Conditions in these brutal detention centres are sub-human. People are dying from starvation. They’re not getting even the most basic health care, and are dying from infected cuts and ingrown fingernails. They suffer acute mental health problems because of the overcrowding and lack of sunlight.\nSend the message below and tell Russia and the U.S. to use their global influence to ensure that independent monitors are allowed in to investigate conditions in Syria’s torture prisons.\nI am writing about the ongoing reports by human rights monitoring groups, in particular Amnesty International, that document the widespread use of torture and other ill-treatment and lethal conditions in Syrian detention facilities.\nSince the beginning of the crisis in 2011 the Syrian authorities have subjected tens of thousands of people in Syria to arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance. Many of them have been subjected to torture or other ill-treatment in Syria’s detention centres and thousands are reported to have died in custody as a result.\nThese practices clearly violate international law as well as the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 2139 and in many cases constitute war crimes. Insofar as they are carried out as part of a widespread, as well as systematic attack directed against the civilian population, they also amount to crimes against humanity.\nI therefore call on you to use your influence in the International Syria Support Group to urgently ensure that independent detention monitors are allowed to investigate conditions in all detention facilities run by the Syrian government or its security forces. They must also be allowed to speak freely to all people who have been deprived of their liberty.\nI urge you also to use your influence to ensure that the Syrian authorities provide detailed information on all those who are held in their custody, and inform the families of those detained about their legal status and whereabouts.\nSince 2011, thousands of people have died in custody in Syria’s prisons. Tens of thousands more have experienced shocking torture. Amnesty International spoke to survivors to document the brutal conditions.\nيجب على الحكومة السورية أن تسمح لمراقبين مستقلين بالتحقيق الآن في الفظاعات التي تشهدها مراكز الاعتقال.\nمنذ عام 2011، لقي آلاف من المعتقلين حتفهم في السجون السورية بسبب التعذيب، كما عانى عشرات الآلاف تعذيباً مروعاً. لقد تعرض المحتجزون إلى ضرب مبرح، واغتصاب، وصدمات كهربائية، والكثير من أنواع التعذيب؛ بهدف انتزاع \"اعترافات\" قسرية منهم. فكل شخص يُشتبه في أنه معارض للحكومة السورية، يكون عرضة للخطر.\nالأوضاع الوحشية السائدة في مراكز الاحتجاز تفتقر إلى أبسط الشروط الإنسانية اللائقة. فالمحتجزون يتعرضون للموت بسبب الجوع، ولا يحصلون على الخدمات الصحية الأساسية. كما يموتون بسبب الالتهابات الناجمة عن الجراح التي يُصابون بها، وبسبب الأظافر الطويلة التي تنمو في أصابعهم. إنهم يعانون مشكلات صحية عقلية حادة بسبب الاكتظاظ ونقص التعرض لأشعة الشمس.\nابعثوا برسالة إلكترونية تحثوا فيها روسيا والولايات المتحدة على استخدام نفوذهما في العالم، وضمان السماح لمراقبين مستقلين بالتحقيق في طبيعة الأوضاع السائدة في السجون السورية، والتي يتعرض فيها المعتقلون إلى التعذيب.\nأكتب إليكم استجابة للتقارير المتواترة التي تصدرها المنظمات المعنية بحقوق الإنسان بشأن أوضاع السجون والمعتقلات في سوريا، ولاسيما منظمة العفو الدولية، والتي تُوَّثق استخدام التعذيب على نطاق واسع وأنواع أخرى من سوء المعاملة والأوضاع السيئة التي تقود إلى موت المعتقلين.\nمنذ بدء الأزمة في عام 2011، تعرض عشرات الآلاف من السوريين إلى الاعتقال التعسفي والاختفاء القسري على يد السلطات. وذكرت التقارير بأن آلافاً من المعتقلين ماتوا خلال الاحتجاز نتيجة لذلك.\nهذه الممارسات تنتهك بكل وضوح القانون الدولي، وبنود قرار مجلس الأمن التابع للأمم المتحدة رقم 2139. وفي عدة حالات، تشكل جرائم حرب. وترقى هذه الممارسات أيضاً إلى جرائم ضد الإنسانية بسبب اتساع نطاقها، واعتدائها الممنهج على السكان المدنيين.\nولهذا السبب، أدعوكم لاستخدام نفوذكم في المجموعة الدولية لدعم سوريا من أجل السماح لمراقبين مستقلين، بشكل عاجل، بالتحقيق في الأوضاع السائدة في مراكز الاعتقال التي تديرها الحكومة السورية أو أجهزتها الأمنية. ويجب أيضا أن يسمح لهم بالاتصال، بدون قيد أو شرط، بالمعتقلين الذين حُرموا من حرياتهم.\nأحثكم أيضاً على استخدام نفوذكم لضمان تقديم السلطات السورية معلومات مفصلة بشأن جميع المعتقلين لديها، وإخبار عائلاتهم بخصوص أوضاعهم القانونية وأماكن احتجازهم.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T14:27:02Z","url":"https://saydnaya.amnesty.org/en/detention-in-syria.html"}

There is an understandable desire to do something to mitigate the damage that a Trump presidency can do to the environment, the social safety net, and to civil liberties. At a time when many people wanted to advance in these areas beyond what the Obama administration has done, there is concern that we are about to take a dramatic step backwards. How does this impact effective giving?\nI would suggest that we continue to support the recommended charities on our new list at the same level we have in the past, or even at an increased level. The value of $1 given to a recommended charity still trumps (forgive the pun) the value of a dollar given domestically — even under the current political environment. However, as citizens I urge everyone to get involved in social movements to which they resonate whether the movement targets the environment, civil rights, or protecting our social safety net. If one feels the understandable urge to give to political movements or organizations fighting the Trump agenda then please consider giving more money over the next four years so that you don’t diminish your gifts to fight global poverty.\nSo don’t let Donald Trump make you forget the world’s poorest people.

Scott was immortalized in concrete when he placed his hand and foot prints in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California on Wednesday, May 17, 2017.\nOn Hollywood Boulevard, just past the man with the albino python wrapped around his neck, lies the TCL Chinese Theatre. Four years ago, the iconic landmark received a multimillion dollar makeover to revive its faded beauty, not unlike some of the aging actors who’ve placed their hands and feet in the theater’s cement courtyard.\nBut Thursday , the majestic movie theater will mark 90 years as the Grand Dame of Hollywood Boulevard, playing host to 20,000 visitors a day from around the globe.\n“It’s just like it looks on TV,” marveled Jay and Nazira Momin, who were visiting from Atlanta.\nThese days it hosts more than 40 movie premieres a year, and it screens the blockbusters moviegoers can’t wait to see each weekend.\nOn Wednesday — a day before the theater’s birthday — Harrison Ford stopped by to watch his friend Ridley Scott, who directed him in the 1982 blockbuster “Blade Runner,” press his hands into wet cement. The filmmaker will be immortalized on the walk in front of the Chinese, along with the likes of Groucho Marx, Betty Grable and George Burns, who left an imprint of his famous cigar.\nScott noted how much the somewhat-seedy neighborhood has changed.\nBuilt during the silent- film era, the movie house opened in 1927 as Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, named after its founder, Sid Grauman. It became Mann’s Chinese Theatre in 1973, reverted back to its original name in 2001, then took on the moniker TCL Chinese Theatre after naming rights were purchased by the Chinese electronics firm, TCL Corp. in 2013.\nOutside the theater Wednesday, tourists were excited to get a glimpse of the landmark and a few real-life movie stars.\n“It’s incredible. I saw Harrison Ford just now,” said 14-year-old Eileen Befeler of Costa Rica as her father smiled.\nShe added that the movie palace was everything she imagined.\nNow, Kushner, 35, reports that the TCL Chinese is the largest IMAX theater in the world.\nShe said she thinks founder Sid Grauman would appreciate the transformation.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T13:07:35Z","url":"https://www.dailynews.com/2017/05/17/hollywoods-iconic-chinese-theatre-famed-for-footprints-turns-90/"}

{"text":"There have been a lot of mentions about this stock on social media and in the media in general such as CNBC etc. I am not surprised as it’s been on a mission the last few weeks; however the recent peak could well have put in a significant peak, especially considering the media attention this stock has got recently.\nWhenever a stock or market gets highlighted, it’s generally very close to a turn and usually close to high or low; in this case I can make a solid claim that there are enough gyrations to suggest the advance from the April 2018 lows has ended an impulse wave (5 wave rally).\nTo support the more bearish idea (Idea 1) and a large move lower to at least correct the advance from the April 2018 lows, then I would want to see a move below 24.90. The alternative idea that I am tracking (Idea 2), suggests the recent high is only that of a 3rd of 3rd wave and a few more gyrations as shown would be seen to extend the advance.\nHowever if we see a big move below 24.90, then I feel the depth of the decline would not be fitting with the prior gyrations and is likely part of a move lower for Idea 1.\nIf you own the stock you might want to pay attention to the area around 25.90 – 26.00, in my opinion, any weakness should really find buyers if further upside is going to be seen for the alternative idea (Idea 2).\nIf history is a guide, then the recent high could be as significant as the prior 2 peaks.\nHave a profitable week ahead.\nShort and long term analysis on US and European markets, various major FX pairs, commodities from Gold and silver to markets like natural gas.\nDaily analysis on where I think the market is going with key support and resistance areas, we move and adjust as the market adjusts.\nA chat room where members can discuss ideas with me or other members.\n*I have permission to post comments from the audio I hear from the S&P pits.\nIf you looking for quality analysis from someone that actually looks at multiple charts and works hard at providing members information to stay on the right side of the trends and making $$$, why not give the site a trial.\nIf any of the readers want to see this article in a PDF format.\nPlease put in the header PDF, or make it known that you want to be added to the mailing list for any future articles.\nOr if you have any questions about becoming a member, please use the email address above.\nIf you like what you see, or want to see more of my work, then please sign up for the 4 week trial.\nThis article is just a small portion of the markets I follow.\nI cover many markets, from FX to US equities, right the way through to commodities.\nIf I have the data I am more than willing to offer requests to members.\nCurrently new members can sign up for a 4 week free trial to test drive the site, and see if my work can help in your trading and if it meets your requirements.\nIf you don't like what you see, then drop me an email within the 1st 4 weeks from when you join, and ask for a no questions refund.\nYou simply have nothing to lose.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T13:36:01Z","url":"http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article63129.html"}

State St., Chicago, parents also are given a discount rental on a video camera with free tape to record their trip. As standard policy, made-to-order breakfasts are free for the whole family (as are evening cocktails for parents).\nThe ultimate service to the childbound is to be found at only three hotels-in New York, Palm Beach Shores, Fla. and on the Hawaiian island of Maui.\nFor children 3 to 13, New York, Palm Beach Shores and Maui also boast Kids Clubs, day-care centers equipped with arcade-caliber video games, indoor basketball, VCRs with tapes and activities designed to keep the children busy while Mom and Dad go shopping or to the theater. Rates are $5 an hour, capped at $20 for the whole day. The New York hotel rents cellular phones to parents so they can keep in touch with their children through the day.\nHotels in the chain are essentially autonomous and cannot be required to offer the Kids Club. But Mary Lee Broder, manager of program development for Embassy Suites, said at an press conference in New York Oct. 15 that the corporation will attempt to get all of them involved.\n- The U.S. Travel Data Center in Washington, D.C., said the number of business trips-155.4 million-was down last year from 1989, but that the number of travelers was up, to more than 35 million adults.\nBroder said travelers ''increasingly are taking their children along,'' a lifestyle change that makes the Kids Club concept a natural.\n''Eighty percent of all vacations today involve at least one child, and last year as many as 6 million children went along on business trips,'' Broder said.\n''Women business travelers now make up one-third of all business travelers, and (some) parents today take their children everywhere with them- in business, pleasure or both.\nBut will notoriously independent hotels in the chain have the will or the heart to take the plunge on childproof rooms and lavish day-care centers for their guests?\n''We`re probably not going to get into that, at least for the next year,'' said Collette Radcliffe, general manager at Denver`s downtown Embassy Suites, which is participating in the ''American Adventure'' promotion.\nAn Arizona Embassy Suites executive, who asked not to be identified, declined to go that far.\n''Families that come here on weekends are coming because we offer a much lower weekend rate than we do during the week, and `Garfield`s American Adventure` is priced so that to give away some of the things they`re giving away, you have to have a higher weekend rate,'' the executive said.\nTravel Editor Alfred Borcover, whose column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T07:09:23Z","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-10-27-9104060928-story.html"}

{"text":"Persistent weakness in the eurozone economy will cause imports and exports through North Europe ports to decline this year, a new report predicts.\n“We are seeing weak consumer demand and a consequent impact on the carriers who persist in continuing to provide far too much capacity, resulting in exceptionally low freight rates. 2015 could be as bad for carriers as 2009 was,” said Ben Hackett of Hackett Associates.\nThe dour outlook in the latest edition of the North Europe Global Port Tracker, produced by Hackett Associates and the Bremen-based Institute of Shipping Economics and Logistics, comes as Asia-Europe spot rates are struggling to recover from a steep fall this year.\nThe Port Tracker report forecasts containerized imports to North Europe ports will contract 0.8 percent, to 14.89 million 20-foot-equivalent units. Exports from the ports are forecast to drop 1.7 percent, to 11.74 million TEUs. Last month’s report forecast growth of 0.4 percent in imports and 0.2 percent for exports.\nDeclines in volumes at North Europe ports are expected to be offset by increased volume at Mediterranean and Black Sea ports, where imports are forecast to rise 6.6 percent, to 8.54 million TEUs, while exports are predicted to increase 11.1 percent, to 7.17 million TEUs.\nTotal European exports are forecast to rise 1.8 percent, to 23.43 million TEUs while exports are expected to increase 2.8 percent, to 18.91 million TEUs.\nHackett said upbeat forecasts of a strong eurozone recovery from the Greek crisis are wrong. He said consumer demand in Europe’s three largest economies, the U.K., France and Germany, is expected to be weak and be primarily for services and vacations.\n“Despite the improvement in some of the basic econometric data, trade demand does not reflect the same growth,” he said.\nThe report noted shifts in market share among North European ports. The opening of the Maasvlakte II terminal has enabled Rotterdam to increase its share of the market to above 30 percent. Despite fears it would lose market share, Antwerp’s share rose to 23 percent in the first quarter from 21.4 percent in the third quarter of 2014, the Port Tracker report said.\nContact Joseph Bonney at joseph.bonney@ihs.com and follow him on Twitter: @JosephBonney.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T12:39:35Z","url":"https://www.joc.com/economy-watch/european-economy-news/declines-forecast-north-europe-imports-exports_20150702.html"}

Please feel free to read our last ATWT fan fiction story before reading on.\nJeffrey hides unknown in a closet in the estate that he tracked Edmund to in San Cristobel. He wonders if it was Tammy he saw, or some trick that Edmund is trying to pull. Jeffrey knows he has to get inside the room to see for himself. He waits in the dark until he hears Edmund and the nurse leave. Jeffrey quietly walks into the room where he saw Tammy sleeping. As he approaches her bedside, the young woman sleeping appears to be Tammy, at least in looks. Her eyes begin to flutter and before he can escape, her eyes open and look directly at him. “Tammy,” is all he can muster up to say. Tammy smiles and says, “Richard.” Jeffrey gets closer and takes her hand. “Are you here to rescue me,” a groggy Tammy asks. He smiles and confirms he is, but asks her to keep it a secret from Edmund. Tammy promises she will and can’t wait to get back home to Springfield to see her family. Jeffrey tells her Jonathan will be overjoyed beyond belief to see her. Tammy wonders who Jonathan is, and Jeffrey knows he must act quickly and get Tammy proper medical treatment. He doesn’t want to give up his cover and sends Jonathan a text for help.\nAs Jonathan is wrapping up lunch with Sarah, he is pleasantly surprised when a familiar voice booms through the door. “I’m back!” announces Reva. Jonathan laughs as his mom saunters into the kitchen at Cross Creek. Reva wants all the details of everything going on in Springfield. Jonathan doesn’t have any news to share and informs her it has been business as usual. “Good thing I came back to liven things up,” Reva laughs. Reva fills her son and granddaughter in on all of the places she, Josh and Colin traveled to on their trip, complete with a visit to Marah. Jonathan is happy to hear that they intend on staying in Springfield for awhile. As Reva begins to question Jonathan about his love life, he becomes distracted with a text. He asks Reva if she can watch Sarah while he makes a phone call. Stepping outside, Jonathan calls Jeffrey and tells him he doesn’t have long to talk.\nJosh arrives at Company and surprises Shane, Billy and Bill, who are all having lunch together. The Lewis men all have a group hug, and then Billy launches in to ribbing Josh about leaving the rest of them behind to go on a love jaunt. Josh tells Shane that he and Reva can’t wait to meet their new granddaughter. Billy pulls Josh aside and tells him he has some concerns to share with him, but wants to discuss it all with him in private later. Josh agrees and privately worries what all has been happening while he has been away.\nDanny returns home to find Michelle helping Robbie and Hope with their homework. The two make small talk about his day at work. He sees an envelope on the bar that says, \"Reardon.\" Danny announces that it is bedtime and sends the kids away so he can talk to Michelle privately. \"Why in the world would you leave something like this laying around in plain view,\" asks a pensive Danny. Michelle wants to tell Rick the truth, but Danny believes it is too risky. He doubts Rick could keep such a secret from his wife, Mindy, let alone anyone else. Michelle points out that the truth is eventually going to come out, especially since Blake has been snooping around.\nDinah and Mallet share a croissant at a French café in Paris.

{"text":"A failure to scan outsourced medical records has caused an approximate three- to five-month backlog at the Memphis Veteran Administration Medical Center, The Daily Caller has learned.\nTheDC was exclusively given a photo snapped of the medical records room on June 12, 2014. In the photo, hundreds of unprocessed medical records sit idly, causing delays of up to five months.\nAccording to a whistle-blower who wished to remain anonymous because they are still employed by the Memphis VA Medical Center, the medical records room is for entering test results and other medical data that occurs after a patient is outsourced for medical tests or procedures.\nA recent audit by the VA flagged the Memphis VA Medical Center after it found the facility had an average wait time for the initial appointment of fifty days.\nThe medical records shown in the photo are generated when the VA refers a patient to another hospital for further medical procedures. Medical tests like colonoscopies, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and X-rays, are among the tests that can be performed by an outside hospital, said the whistle-blower.\nThe outside hospital then sends their results back to the Memphis VA Medical Center, and those results are supposed to be scanned into the VA system.\nInstead of being scanned in, the results are piling up, said the whistle-blower, causing further delays beyond the initial wait times.\n“If you’re waiting for the results of a colonoscopy, [the added wait time is] the difference between life and death,” the whistle-blower told TheDC.\nAccording to this whistle-blower, about an hour after TheDC sent VA communications officer Sandra Glover an email listing these charges, the medical records were moved from the medical records room and into the office of Rebecca England, the chief of Medical Records. Glover is a communications officer for the Veteran Integrated Services Network 9, which includes the Memphis VA Medical Center.\nThe Memphis VA Medical Center is now scrambling, asking dozens to work over-time in order to clear up the back log, and the VA police are investigating the source of the leak to TheDC, the whistle-blower noted.\nThe Memphis VA Medical Center cares deeply for every veteran we are privileged to serve. Our goal is to provide the best quality care in a safe environment, as quickly and effectively as we can. After receiving the photograph you sent, we checked with the Memphis VA Medical Center to determine its validity and, if warranted, what actions could be taken to process those medical records as quickly as possible.\nIt was determined that the record — forwarded from the facility’s outpatient clinics — should have been processed, and subsequently the facility took the appropriate actions to scan them in to the electronic patient record. Memphis VA Medical Center hired a new supervisor two months ago in the patient records area and the consult process has been redesigned to better monitor timeliness. We continue to take action to strengthen oversight mechanisms to prevent delays.\nWhile we regret that the files weren’t processed in a more timely fashion, this is an administrative function that did not impact patient outcomes. Critical clinical information was previously communicated with treating clinicians. In the end, these files have been addressed – which is what we want for the sake of all our patients. Thank you for your concern for our nation’s veterans and for bringing this to our attention.\nTheDC spoke with a veteran who was likely affected by this backlog. Jesse Blakely served in the military in the early 1970s.\nIn November 2013, he walked into the Memphis VA Medical Center complaining of chest pains. After waiting several hours in the emergency room with no help, Blakely left and was treated at nearby Methodist Hospital.\nBlakely said Methodist Hospital ran several tests as part of his treatment, but his follow-up appointment at the Memphis VA Medical Center didn’t occur until the beginning of June — more than six months later.\nBlakely told TheDC that to add insult to injury, even though he was initially assured by the VA that his medical bills would be covered, he’s since been charged for his trip to the Methodist Hospital emergency room.\nEarlier in June, TheDC broke exclusively that in 2010, the same Memphis VA Medical Center approved over $1 million in bonuses while closing a therapy pool just a few months later citing a lack of funds. Bill O’Reilly used that report as the basis of his “Is it Legal” segment the next day.\nA staffer at the House Veteran Affairs Committee told TheDC the committee was unaware of any other VA hospitals where outsourced medical tests were causing back logs.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T06:55:13Z","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2014/06/23/shocker-thedc-uncovers-another-va-medical-center-scandal/"}
{"text":"Cracking down on thieving retailers is of course a good idea, but, really? Going after SNAP beneficiaries who try to convert their meager benefits to an even more meager amount of cash? I imagine some people who do this are using the money for Things We Officially Frown Upon, but some are probably trying to pay their damn bills.\nMy guess is that this crackdown is hardly a huge program, so it’s not as if loads of resources are being diverted to make life more difficult for the poor. Beyond that, though, Obama seems to instinctively get something that the rest of us lefties probably ought to appreciate more: like it or not, if you want the public to support government programs, you need to make sure they’re administered effectively. That’s doubly or triply true of social welfare programs, which are easily demagogued even in the best of times. If anything, liberals who support these programs ought to be more concerned about rooting out fraud and improving efficiency than conservatives, who’d be just as happy to see them simply go away.\nThis is fundamentally a Charlie Peters-ish neoliberal insight, and neoliberalism has obviously taken a lot of lumps over the past decade.

{"text":"Proclus of Athens (*412–485 C.E.) was the most authoritative philosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages. For almost fifty years, he was head or ‘successor’ (diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic ‘Academy’ in Athens. Being an exceptionally productive writer, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato, systematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at that time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics, ethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom (Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on the development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens, but also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of the school. In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic philosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions of wisdom. Continuing a movement that was inaugurated by Iamblichus (4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and following the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to demonstrate the harmony of the ancient religious revelations (the mythologies of Homer and Hesiod, the Orphic theogonies and the Chaldaean Oracles) and to integrate them in the philosophical tradition of Pythagoras and Plato. Towards this end, his Platonic Theology offers a magisterial summa of pagan Hellenic theology. Probably the best starting point for the study of Proclus’ philosophy is the Elements of Theology (with the masterly commentary by E.R. Dodds) which provide a systematic introduction into the Neoplatonic metaphysical system.\nSince Proclus’ extant works contain almost no evidence about his biography, we have to rely on the information transmitted by his direct pupil Marinus of Neapolis in the eulogy he devoted to his predecessor Proclus or on Happiness. Moreover, some scattered remarks on Proclus and valuable information about the schools in Athens and Alexandria can be found in Damascius’ Life of Isidorus (called by other scholars The Philosophical History). As with Porphyry’s Life of Plotinus, both Marinus’ and Damascius’ works are biographies written by students praising extensively the achievements of their teachers both in doctrine and in philosophical life.\nOn Proclus’ works see Beutler (1957), 190–208, Saffrey-Westerink (1968), lv–lx, Rosán (²2009), 266–274, and especially Luna–Segonds–Endress (2012), as well as the short overview given below (1.2). Although a large part of his numerous writings is lost, some major commentaries on Plato have survived (though incomplete) and some important systematic works. Moreover, later Neoplatonists such as Damascius, Olympiodorus, Simplicius, and Philoponus have conserved many extracts of lost work, but these fragments have never been collected (see now, however, Luna–Segonds–Endress (2012)).\nProclus was born in Constantinople/Byzantium (now Istanbul) into a rich Lycian family in 412. Not long after his birth his parents returned to their hometown Xanthos in Lycia, a maritime area of what is now southwest Turkey. He began his education in Xanthos and moved from there to Alexandria (Egypt) to pursue the study of rhetoric in order to become a lawyer, as was his father. However, during a journey to Byzantium he discovered philosophy as his vocation. Back in Alexandria he studied Aristotle and mathematics. Marinus reports that the very gifted pupil easily learned all of Aristotle’s logical writings by heart.\nIn 430–431, 18 years old, Proclus moved to Athens, attracted by the fame of the Platonic School there. He studied for two years under the direction of Plutarch (of Athens; to be distinguished from the 1st–2nd c. philosopher/biographer), reading with him Plato’s Phaedo and Aristotle’s De anima. After Plutarch’s death in 432, Syrianus became the head of the Academy. Proclus followed with him the usual curriculum of the school (going back to Iamblichus), reading first Aristotle’s works and after that entering the ‘greater mysteries,’ the Platonic dialogues. Under Syrianus, Proclus also came into contact with the older traditions of wisdom such as the theology of the Orphics and the Chaldaean Oracles. Among Syrianus’ lost works we find a treatise On the harmony of Orpheus, Pythagoras and Plato with the Chaldaean Oracles. As the Suda lexicon attributes a work with this title also to Proclus, it is not unlikely that he published Syrianus’ treatise, adding comments of his own. Since Syrianus and Proclus worked intensively together for six years, Proclus was strongly influenced by his teacher. On many occasions Proclus praises the philosophical achievements of his teacher and he never criticizes him. Because of this, it is almost impossible to distinguish between Proclus’ original contribution and what he adopted from Syrianus.\nAfter Syrianus’ death (437), Proclus succeeded as head of the Athenian school, and he kept this position for almost fifty years until his death in 485. His tight schedule of the day, starting with a prayer to the sun at sunrise (repeated at noontime and at sunset), included lectures, reading seminars, discussions with students, and literary work of his own. Besides his philosophical activities, Marinus also portrays Proclus as an experienced practitioner of theurgy (Life of Proclus, § 28–29; on theurgy see below 3.6). The practice of these pagan rites could only be continued in the private sphere of the School’s grounds. Though Proclus was in Athens a highly respected philosopher and had some Christian students, he had to be prudent to avoid anti-pagan reactions. Marinus tells that he had to go into exile for about one year to Lydia (in Asia) to avoid difficulties (Life of Proclus § 15).\nMarinus notes that Proclus was an extremely industrious writer, having an “unbounded love of work” (Life of Proclus § 22). Apart from an impressive teaching-load and several other commitments, Proclus wrote every day about 700 lines (about 20–25 pages). It is unlikely that Proclus published all of them. However that may be, from Proclus’ extant works and the information about his lost works it emerges that he was a productive writer indeed. Roughly two thirds of Proclus’ output is now lost and several works, especially his commentaries on Plato, have been transmitted in a mutilated form.\nProclus’ Works (the main extant works).\nIt is difficult to establish a chronology of Proclus’ works. The Platonic Theology is generally considered to be his last work. In writing the Theology Proclus heavily depends on his interpretation of the Parmenides and often refers to his commentary on this dialogue, which must have been finished some time before. We know from Marinus (Life of Proclus §13) that Proclus finished his Commentary on the Timaeus by the age of 27. However, it cannot be excluded that Proclus rewrote or modified it later. As the Alcibiades came at the beginning of the curriculum in the school, its commentary may also be an early work. The Commentary on the Republic is not a proper commentary, but a collection of several essays on problems and sections in this dialogue. These essays may have been written at different times in Proclus’ life and only later put together (by Proclus himself or by someone else). The Hypotypôsis (Exposition of Astronomical Hypotheses) was written in the year after Proclus’ exile in Lydia, but we do not know when exactly that took place. The Tria opuscula all deal with similar topics, but they need not have been composed at the same time. There are plausible arguments to put the second treatise, On What Depends on Us, some years after the events forcing Proclus to go into exile. The first treatise, which in some parts depends very much on Plutarch (of Chaironea, 1st–2nd c. C.E.), could be set earlier in his career. It also contains a discussion on the nature of evil, which is much simpler than what we find in the treatise On the Existence of Evils, which is more sophisticated and probably was composed later. Because of its introductory character, one may be inclined to consider the Elements of Physics as an early work. This has also been claimed for the Elements of Theology, which, however, shows all the sophistication of Proclus’s mature thought. It may be possible that Proclus revised this text several times in his career.\nThe center of Proclus’ extensive oeuvre is without doubt his exegesis of Plato, as is shown by the large commentaries he devoted to major dialogues. This Platonic focus is also evident in the composition of his systematic works. The Platonic Theology offers a systematic exposition of theology based on an interpretation of all relevant sections on the gods and their attributes in Plato’s dialogues, and in particular on the Parmenides, considered as the most theological of all dialogues. Proclus probably commented on all dialogues included in the curriculum of the school since Iamblichus. In addition Proclus wrote the commentary on the Republic mentioned above. The curriculum consisted of altogether 12 dialogues distributed into two cycles. The first cycle started with Alcibiades (on self-knowledge) and ended with the Philebus (on the final cause of everything: the good), comprising two dialogues on ethics (the Gorgias and the Phaedo), two on logic (the Cratylus and the Theaetetus), two on physics (the Sophist and the Statesman), and two on theology (the Phaedrus and the Symposium). The second cycle included the two perfect dialogues that were considered to encompass Plato’s whole philosophy (In Tim. I 13.14–17), namely, the Timaeus (on physics) and the Parmenides (on theology).\nIn the form and method of his commentaries, Proclus is again influenced by Iamblichus. He assumes that each Platonic dialogue must have one main theme (skopos) to which all parts of the arguments ought to be related. To interpret the text, different approaches are possible (theological, mathematical, physical, ethical exegesis), but they are all interconnected according to the principle ‘everything in everything’ (panta en pasin). Thus, the Timaeus has in all its parts as its purpose the explanation of nature (physiologia). Even the introductory sections, the summary of the discussion in the Republic and the anticipation of the story about Atlantis, must be understood from this point of view; for they contain, in the mode of ‘images and examples,’ a description of the fundamental forces that are at work in the physical world. Also the long treatise on human nature, which concludes Timaeus’ exposition, has ultimately a cosmological meaning, as the human animal is a microcosmos wherein all elements and all causes of the great universe are found. More problematic was the determination of the skopos of the Parmenides. In a long discussion with the whole hermeneutical tradition since middle-Platonism, Proclus defends a theological interpretation of the dialogue. According to him, the dialectical discussion on the One and the Many (ta alla) reveals the first divine principles of all things.\nWith the exception of the commentary on the Cratylus, of which only a selection of notes from the original commentary is preserved, the exegetical works of Proclus have a clear structure. They divide the Platonic text in different lemmata or cited passages, discussing first the doctrine exposed in the particular section (pragmata, later called theoria), next commenting on the formulation of the argument (called lexis) [see Festugière 1963]. Whereas modern scholars usually accept a development in Plato’s thought and distinguish between an early, middle, and late Plato, the Neoplatonists take the Platonic corpus as the expression of a divinely inspired and unitary philosophical doctrine. This enables them to connect different Platonic dialogues into one system and to see numerous cross-references within the Platonic oeuvre. What may seem to be contradictions between statements made in different dialogues, can be explained by different pedagogical contexts, some dialogues being rather maieutic than expository, some elenctic of the sophistic pseudo-science, some offering a dialectical training to young students.\nA Neoplatonic commentary offers much more than a faithful interpretation of an authoritative text of Plato. Plato’s text gives the commentator an opportunity to develop his own views on the most fundamental philosophical questions, the first principles, the idea of the Good, the doctrine of the Forms, the soul and its faculties, nature, etc. As was said, the two culminating dialogues, the Timaeus and the Parmenides, offer together a comprehensive view of the whole of Platonic philosophy.\nThe interpretation of the Parmenides thus prepares the way for the Platonic Theology, offering the systematic structure for a scientific demonstration of the procession of all the orders of gods from the first principle. As Proclus explains at Theol. Plat. I 2, p. 9.8–19, the Platonic Theology falls into three parts (after a long methodological introduction). The first part (Theol. Plat. I 13–29) is an investigation into the common notions (koinai ennoiai) of the gods as we find them in Plato’s dialogues: it is a treatise on the divine names and attributes. The second part (Theol. Plat. II–VI), which is incomplete, unfolds in a systematic way the procession of the divine hierarchies, from the One, that is the first god, to the ‘higher kinds,’ i.e., angels, daimones, and heroes, while the third part, which is altogether missing, was supposed to deal with the individual hypercosmic and encosmic gods.\nFollowing Plato, Aristotle explains in his Physics the general principles of natural things: form, matter, nature, the essence and principles of movement, time and place; again taking inspiration from the Timaeus, he studies in other works the specific principles of the distinct regions of the physical world, thus in the De Caelo the celestial and the sublunary realm, and in On generation and corruption and in Meteorologica the sublunary realm. In this domain, it cannot be denied, Aristotle did much more than his master. According to Proclus, however, he developed the subject ‘beyond what is needed’. The same remark must be made about Aristotle’s extensive zoological research. Whereas Plato limited himself in the Timaeus to an analysis of the fundamental principles of all living organisms, Aristotle gave most of his attention to the material components of animals and scarcely, and only in few cases, did he consider the organism from the perspective of the form. Plato, on the contrary, when explaining the physical world, never got lost in a detailed examination.\nWhen trying to determine Proclus’ profile as a philosopher, one has to keep in mind that Platonists were not keen on introducing new elements into the Platonic doctrine. They despised innovation (kainotomia). Yet it cannot be denied that Neoplatonic philosophy differs considerably from what we read in Plato’s dialogues. There is also overwhelming evidence for continual discussions in the school on the right interpretation of Plato or on certain doctrinal points (such as the transcendence of the One, or the question whether the soul wholly descended from the intelligible world). In order to evaluate Proclus’ originality, one ought to compare his views with those of the Neoplatonists before him, such as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Syrianus. Only with regard to Plotinus is this possible to a great extent, because we still have the full corpus of Plotinus’ writings. Proclus certainly admired the first ‘founder’ of the new Platonism and even devoted a commentary to the Enneads, of which, alas, we have only some fragments. He shared Plotinus’ views on the three principal hypostases the One, the Intellect and the Soul, and often uses language inspired by his reading of Plotinus, as in his description of the union of the soul with the ineffable One. Yet on many points, he is very critical of Plotinus, pointing to contradictions, rejecting provocative views such as the thesis that One is cause of itself (causa sui), the doctrine of the undescended soul, or the identification of evil with matter. Another radical difference from Plotinus (and Porphyry) is the importance attributed to theurgy for the salvation of the soul and the authority of Chaldaean Oracles.\nAs said before, it is very difficult to mark off Proclus’ originality with regard to his teacher Syrianus, the only predecessor he never criticizes. Of the literary production of the latter, we have only his Commentary on Aristotle’s Metaphysics. It is possible that most of Syrianus’ courses on Plato never were published, but were continued and further worked out by Proclus himself. We have, however, the commentary on the Phaedrus by Hermeias, who was sitting together with Proclus, in Syrianus’ course. One gets the impression that Syrianus was very interested in Orphic theogony, whereas for Proclus the Chaldaean Oracles are more authoritative when developing a Platonic theology. But here again, it is difficult to compare as we do not possess Proclus’ own commentary. Is Proclus after all then not so original, but only an excellent teacher and wonderful systematizer of the new Platonic doctrines which became dominant in the school since Iamblichus on? We shall never know, and it is after all not so important when assessing the philosophical merits of his works. To praise Proclus’ philosophical achievements, Marinus devotes in Life of Proclus one chapter to the discussion of the doctrines we owe to him (§ 23). Surprisingly, for all his admiration for the master, he can only enumerate a few innovative doctrines; and they are of such a minor importance that we shall not even discuss them in this article.\nIn late antiquity, Aristotle’s Metaphysics was considered to be a theological work, because Aristotle investigates in this treatise the first principles of all being.\nIndeed, there is precedent for this in Aristotle himself, for in Metaphysics VI, 1, 1026a15ff, he classifies “first philosophy,” or metaphysics, as theology.\nProclus himself often uses the term ‘theology’ in this metaphysical sense for the study of the first (‘divine’) principles of all things. His Elements of Theology can in fact be considered an introduction to his metaphysics. The work is a concatenated demonstration of 217 propositions, which may be divided into two halves: the first 112 propositions establish the One, unity without any multiplicity, as the ultimate cause of reality and lay down basic metaphysical concepts/structures such as causality, participation, the relation of wholes to parts, infinity, and eternity. The second half deals with the three kinds of true causes within reality recognized by Proclus: gods (which he calls henads or “unities,” see below), intellects, and souls. This elaborate metaphysical framework makes it possible for Proclus to develop a scientific theology, i.e., a demonstration of the procession and properties of the different classes of gods. In what follows we will only discuss some characteristic features of Proclus’ metaphysics (see further Steel 2011).\nOn the whole, Proclus’ doctrine of first principles is a further development of Plotinus’ innovative interpretation of Platonic philosophy. With Plotinus, Proclus recognizes three fundamental levels of reality called ‘hypostases’ (or self-subsistent entities): One, Intellect, and Soul. However, following a concern of his predecessor Iamblichus for greater precision in the relationship and distinction between the One and Intellect, Proclus distinguishes between the intelligible Being (to noêton—what is the object of intellectual intuition) and the intellective (to noeron—what is intelligizing), and introduces between both, as an intermediary level, the noêton-noeron (what is being intelligized and intelligizing). These three ontological levels thus correspond to the triad of Being, Life, and Intellect, which already play an important role in Plotinus’ and Porphyry’s speculations about the procession or ‘emanation’ of the intelligible world from the One, without, however, being hypostasized. Since Zeller (influenced by Hegel) the application of the triadic structure to reality has been seen as the characteristic feature of Proclus’ system, but see Dodds 19632, pp. xxii and 220, on possible sources of the doctrine.\nAnother fundamental triad is the triad Unparticipated-Participated-Participating (amethekton-metechomenon-metechon). Plato’s theory of participation, which explains the relation between the intelligible world and the sensible reality it grounds, raised many problems, several of which Plato himself brings up in the first part of his Parmenides. Most pressing was the puzzle: How can a Form be at the same time one and the same and exist as a whole in many participants? (see Plato, Parmenides 131a-b). The basic idea of the triad of participation, which can also be seen as responding to Aristotle’s criticism of participation, is to maintain the transcendence, and hence, the unity of the Form, while allowing for its presence in the participants. Thanks to the existence of an ‘unparticipated’ principle, that is, one that is not such as to be participated in by anything, to which the ‘participated’ entities, the ones that are participated in by something, are connected by means of “the triad of triads” (Elem. Theol. § 23), the universal nature of the Form can be safeguarded.\nProclus, however, also applies this principle to explain the most difficult problem facing Neoplatonic metaphysics, namely, how to understand the procession of the manifold from the One. How can the One be wholly without multiplicity, when it must somehow be the cause of any and all multiplicity? The One remains in itself absolutely unparticipated; the many different beings proceeding from it participate in a series of participated henads or unities (gods). According to some scholars it was Iamblichus who introduced this innovative doctrine, others attribute it to Proclus’ teacher Syrianus. Even if the doctrine does not originate as such from Iamblichus himself, the existence of the divine henads somehow follows from his law of mean terms. This law states that “every producing cause brings into existence things like to itself before the unlike.“ (Elem. Theol. § 28). Thus there are no leaps in the chain of being, but everything is linked together by similar terms. The henads fulfill this function, for as participated unities they bridge the gap between the transcendent One and everything that comes after it. The doctrine of the henads can thus be seen as a way of integrating the traditional gods of Greek polytheistic religion into the Neoplatonic metaphysics of the One.\na. Auxiliary and true causes. From Middle Platonism onwards, various attempts were made to integrate the Aristotelian doctrine of causes within the Platonic philosophy (see Steel 2003). In Plato’s work, it was argued, one can find the four types of causality that Aristotle distinguishes, to wit formal, material, efficient, final, and, besides, the paradigmatic cause, which Aristotle wrongly rejected. This system of causes (with the addition of the instrumental cause as a sixth) became standard in later Neoplatonism. In his commentary on the Timaeus, Proclus observes that Aristotle never rises to the proper level of causality. For the four causes, as Aristotle understands them, can only be applied to the explanation of processes in the sublunary world. In the Platonic view, however, the material and formal causes are only subservient or instrumental causes. Those causes are in fact immanent in their effects and constitutive elements of the thing they produce. As Proclus asserts in prop. 75 of the Elements of Theology, “that which exists in the effect is not so much a cause as an auxiliary cause (sunaition) or an instrument of the producer.” Causes in the proper sense must act upon their effects from outside, while transcending them. For a proper understanding of what the true causes are of all things, Proclus argues, one must follow Plato, who lifts us up to the level of the transcendent Forms and makes us discover the creative causality of the demiurge and the finality of the Good as the ultimate explanation of all aspirations.\nAlthough Aristotle also discusses efficient and final causes, he falls short of a true understanding of creative causality because he abandons the hypothesis of the Forms. Without the transcendent Forms, there can be no explanation of the being of things, only an explanation of their movement and change. Given Aristotle’s narrow understanding of nature, it must come as no surprise, Proclus notices, that he admits of cases of ‘spontaneous generation’ in the sublunary realm, which again restricts the purport of efficient causality. Moreover, because of his rejection of the demiurge (and of the One), Aristotle is also forced to limit efficient causality to the sublunary realm. In fact, in his view there is no cause of existence of the celestial bodies or of the sensible world as a whole: they exist necessarily in all eternity. But, as Proclus argues, such a position will force him to admit that the world has the capacity to constitute itself, which is absurd (see below).\nThe Neoplatonic concept of causality is therefore quite different from that of the Peripatetics, even if both share the same terminology, such as final or efficient cause. Aristotle’s causes are primarily intended to explain how things move and change, come to be and cease to be, but also offer to explain what given things are. For the Neoplatonists, generalizing a principle formulated in the Philebus — “that everything that comes to be comes to be through a cause” (26e, cf. Tim. 28a) — causality is of much wider application than the explanation of change and motion, it is not only about what things are, but about what constitutes (hupostatikos) their being, and it can be, analogously, used to explain relations between all levels of being. Thus we can say of the One that it is the cause of Intellect, and of Intellect that it is cause of Soul. In the Timaeus, however, the main interest is to understand what is the cause of the sensible world and all the cosmic beings: this is primarily the demiurge or creator of the world (the One is not the ‘creator’ of Intellect).\nEvery body has by its own nature the capacity to be acted upon, every incorporeal thing the capacity to act, the former being in itself inactive, the latter impassive; but through association with the body, the incorporeal too is acted upon, just as bodies too can act because of the participation in incorporeal entities.\nIn this proposition Proclus first sets apart the corporeal and incorporeal as being active/impassible and passive/inactive respectively. However, the two realms are not absolutely separate from each other. The soul, which is an incorporeal substance, enters into association with the body and thus becomes itself, though only accidentally, subject to different passions. The body, on the contrary, may gain great profit from the association with the incorporeal. This is evident in the case of animated bodies, which owe all their vital activities to the presence of the soul in them. But also inanimate natural bodies acquire all capacities and powers from nature and its inherent logoi or organizing rational principles (see Steel 2002).\nc. The relation of cause to its effect. The relation between a cause and its effect is characterized by both similarity and dissimilarity. For every cause produces something that is similar to it, and every effect thus resembles its cause, though in a secondary and less perfect way. But in so far as the effect is really distinguished from its cause, it acquires its own characteristic form of being, which was not yet developed on the level of its cause. For this reason each thing can be said to exist in three manners (Elem. Theol. § 65). First, it is in itself as expressing formally its own character (kath’ hyparxin). Second, it exists in a causal manner (kat’ aitian) being anticipated in its cause. Finally, it exists as being participated (kata methexin) by the next level of being, which is its effect. Thus life is a property of a living organism as being participated by it. Life characterizes the soul formally. Life also exists qua Form in the divine mind. Finally, Proclus stresses that the higher a cause, the more comprehensive it is, and the further its effects reach (Elem. Theol. § 57). All things, including matter, which has in itself, apart from the forms existing in it, no ‘being’, participate in the One; all beings participate in Being; all plants and animals participate in Life; all rational souls participate in Intellect.\nProclus’ epistemology is firmly rooted in his theory of the soul. For Proclus, souls as self-moving principles represent the lowest level of entities that are capable of reverting upon itself (so called self-constituted beings [authypostata], see Elem. Theol. § 40–51). They are incorporeal, separable from bodies and indestructible/immortal (Elem. Theol. § 186–7). Yet, they are principles of life and of movement of bodies (Elem. Theol. § 188). In accordance with Proclus’ general metaphysical principles (cf. above 3.1), from the unparticipated soul-monad proceed different kinds of participated soul: divine souls, daemonic souls, human souls, souls of animals). As with other Platonists, Proclus frequently discusses the vexed question as to why a soul would descend into a body at all (‘fall of the soul’) (see Dörrie / Baltes (2002.2) 163–218). Moreover, the Neoplatonist distinguishes between altogether three so-called vehicles (ochêmata) of the soul. The rational soul is permanently housed in the luminous vehicle, while the non-rational soul is located in the pneumatic vehicle. By being incarnated in a human body, soul, or rather, the vegetative soul attains thus a (third) ‘shell-like’ vehicle. The theory of the different vehicles or the psychic ‘astral body,’ familiar nowadays from modern theosophic theories, fulfils several crucial functions in Neoplatonic psychology: it explains (a) how an incorporeal soul can be linked to a body, (b) how souls can move in space, (c) how souls can be punished after death (cf. Plato’s myths), (d) where certain faculties of the soul such as imagination are located. Proclus distinguishes between two kinds of vehicles, one mortal and the other immortal (In Tim. III 236.31 ff. and Elem. Theol. § 207–210). Proclus also adheres to the Platonic theory of transmigration, but argues that human souls never enter animal bodies as their constitutive forms. For only animal souls can be organizing principles of animal bodies. If some rational souls are ‘degraded’ in the next life and forced to live in an animal body because of their misdemeanour in this life, they are only ‘relationally’ (schesei) present to this animal body.\nProclus distinguishes between the following faculties of soul: sense perception, imagination (phantasia), opinion, discursive thought, and intellection. While sense perception and imagination belong to the non-rational soul, opinion forms the lowest level of rationality. The aim of epistemological ascent is to free oneself eventually from the lower psychic faculties, including the lower rational ones, in order to enjoy a state of pure contemplation.\nAs with many other Platonists, Proclus’ epistemology is based on a theory of innate knowledge (in accordance with the Platonic dictum that ‘all learning is recollection [anamnêsis]’). Proclus refers to the innate contents of the soul as its reason-principles (logoi) or Forms (eidê). These innate reason-principles constitute the essence of soul. That is why they are called ‘essential reason-principles’ (logoi ousiôdeis) (Steel 1997). The traditional translation reason-principles was chosen on purpose, because on an ontological level these same logoi serve as principles of all things. They are extended or unfolded images of the Forms that exist in intellect; and by means of them the world-soul with the assistance of Nature brings forth everything. In other words, the psychic logoi are instantiations of Platonic Forms on the level of soul as are the logoi in Nature and the forms immanent in matter. According to the fundamental Neoplatonic axiom panta en pasin (‘all things are in all things’), Forms exist on all levels of reality. But the logoi in soul also offer the principles of all knowledge and are the starting points of demonstration. At In Parm. IV 894.3–18 (ed. Steel) Proclus argues that only with reference to these notions within the soul predication is possible (see Helmig 2008), since they are universal in the true sense of the word. On the other hand, both transcendent Platonic Forms and forms in matter are not taken to be universals proper by Proclus. The former are rather intelligible particulars, as it were, and cannot be defined (Steel 2004), while the latter are strictly speaking instantiated or individualised universals that are not shared by many particulars (see Helmig 2008, cf. above 3.1–2). For this reason, it does not make much sense to talk about ‘the problem of universals’ in Proclus.\nIt is another crucial assumption of Proclus’ epistemology that all souls share the same logoi (Elem. Theol. § 194–195). In terms of concept-formation this entails that psychic concepts, once they are grasped correctly, are universal, objective, and shareable (see Helmig (2012) 13–24). Moreover, if all souls share the same logoi, and these logoi are the principles of reality (see above), then by grasping the logoi souls come to know the true principles or causes of reality. Already Aristotle had written that to know something signifies to know its cause (Met. A 3, 983a25–26 and An. Post. I 2, 71b9–12). In his Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus, Proclus introduces an interesting distinction. Taking his start from the problem of how we can recognise certain objects, he considers the example of an apple. The different senses tell us that there is something sweet, red, even, with a nice smell. And while common sense (koinê aisthêsis) can distinguish the different impressions of the special senses, only opinion (doxa) is capable of saying that the object there on the table is an apple. Doxa is able to do this, because it has access to the innate logoi of the soul. However, as Proclus explains (In Tim. I 248.11 ff.), opinion only knows the ‘that’ (hoti), that is, it can recognize objects. Discursive thought (dianoia), on the other hand, also knows the ‘why’ (dihoti), that is, the causes of something. This distinction can also be rephrased in terms of concepts, implying a distinction between factual concepts that allow us to identify or recognise certain objects, and concepts that fulfil an explanatory role. On the whole, Proclus’ reading and systematisation of Plato’s doctrine of learning as recollection makes Platonic recollection not only concerned with higher learning, since already on the level of object recognition we employ concepts that originate from the innate logoi of the soul (Helmig (2012) 299–333).\nProclus argues at length that the human soul has to contain innate knowledge. Therefore, one should not consider it an empty writing tablet, as Aristotle does (Aristotle, De anima III 4). He is wrong in asserting that the soul contains all things potentially. According to Proclus, the soul contains all things (i.e., all logoi) in actuality, though due to the ‘shock of birth’ it may seem as if the soul has fallen to potentiality. At In Crat. § 61, Proclus asserts that the soul does not resemble an empty writing tablet (agraphon grammateion) and does not possess all things in potentiality, but in act. In Eucl. 16.8–13 expresses the same idea: “the soul is not a writing tablet void of logoi, but it is always written upon and always writing itself and being written on by the intellect.” As with his philosophy of mathematics, Proclus presents a detailed criticism of the view that universal concepts are derived from sensible objects (by abstraction, induction, or collection). In the fourth book of his Commentary on Plato’s Parmenides and in the two prologues of the Commentary on Euclid we find the most comprehensive criticism of abstractionism in antiquity (see Helmig (2010) and (2012) 205–221).\nProclus devoted three entire books or ‘monographs’ (monobiblia) to problems of providence, fate, free choice, and evil. The first treatise (Ten problems concerning providence) examines ten different problems on providence that were commonly discussed in the Platonic school. For Proclus providence (pronoia) is the beneficent activity of the first principle (the ‘source of goods’) and the gods (henads), who have their existence before intellect (pro-nou). One of the problems discussed is the question of how divine foreknowledge and human free choice can be reconciled. For if god knows not only past and present, but also future events, the outcome of future events is already pre-determined (as god has a determinate knowledge of all things), and hence there is no free choice for humans. Proclus’ answer, which ultimately goes back to Iamblichus, consists in applying the principle that the mode of knowledge is not conditioned by the object known but by the knower. In the case of gods, this entails that they know the contingent event in a non contingent manner, the mutable immutably. They have an undivided knowledge of things divided and a timeless knowledge of things temporal (Elem. Theol. § 124, cf. De decem dub. § 6–8). Proclus’ answer was later taken up by Ammonius in his Commentary on the De Interpretatione IX and in Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy V 6 as well as in his Commentary on the De Interpretatione IX.\nThese three distinctions taken together make it possible for Proclus to ultimately reconcile providence, fate, and free choice. In so far as we are rational agents and let ourselves being determined in our choices only by intelligible principles, we may transcend the determinism of fate to which we belong as corporeal beings. Yet, our actions are integrated into the providential order, as we willingly obey the divine principles.\nThe third treatise (On the existence of evils) asks why and how evil can exist if the world is governed by divine providence. Proclus argues that evil does not have an existence of its own, but only a derivative or parasitic existence (par-hypostasis, sc. on the good) (De mal. § 50).\nDionysius the Areopagite adopted Proclus’ views on evil in his work On the Divine Names. Thanks to this adaptation Proclus’ doctrine of evil had an enormous influence on the later medieval discussions on evil both in Byzantium and in the Latin West and dominated the philosophical debates on evil up to the 19th century.\nBefore offering an explanation of the generation of the world, Timaeus sets out the fundamental principles that will govern his whole explanation of the physical world (Tim. 27d5–28b5). As Proclus observes, it is the task of a scientist to formulate at the start of his project the principles proper to the science in question, and not just to assume some general axioms. The science of nature too is based on specific axioms and assumptions, which must be clarified before we can move to the demonstration. In order to make phusiologia a real science, the philosopher must deduce his explanation, as does the geometer, from a set of fundamental propositions or axioms.\nStarting from these fundamental propositions, Proclus argues, Plato deduces the different types of causality that are required for a truly scientific understanding of nature (efficient, exemplary, and final cause; see Steel 2003 and above 3.2).\nProclus discusses eternity and time in his commentary on the Timaeus and in propositions 53–55 of the Elements of Theology (see Steel 2001). Aristotle had defined time as a “measure of movement according to the before and after.” Therefore, anything measured by time must have a form of existence or activity in which a past and a future state can be distinguished. In fact, an entity in time is never wholly and simultaneously what it is, but has an existence extended in a process of before and after. Opposed to it stands the eternal, which exists as a simultaneous whole and admits of no composition or change. “There is no part of it,” writes Proclus, “which has already subsisted and another that will subsist later, but as yet is not. All that it is capable of being, already possesses it in entirety without losing it or without accumulating” (Elem. Theol. § 52). One must distinguish the temporality of things in process from the time by which they are measured. Temporal things participate in time, without being time. “Time exists prior to all things in time” (Elem. Theol. § 53).\nWith Iamblichus, Proclus distinguishes absolute time, which is not participated in and exists ‘prior’ to all temporal things, from participated time, or rather the many participated times. The same distinctions must also be made regarding eternity. For Eternity precedes as cause and measures the multiple eternal beings that participate in it. “Every Eternity is a measure of things eternal, every Time of things in time; and these two are the only measures of life and movement in things” (Elem. Theol. § 54). To conclude, there are two measures of the duration of things. First there is eternity, which measures at once the whole duration of a being. Second, there is time, which measures piecemeal the extension of a being that continually passes from one state to another. Eternity can be seen as the prefiguration of time; time as the image of eternity. Each of them governs a separate sphere of reality, eternity the intelligible being, time the temporal (corporeal and psychic) world of change.\nNotwithstanding the sharp distinction between the temporal and the eternal realm, there are beings that share in both eternity and time. As Proclus notes in the corollary to Elem. Theol. § 55, “of the things which exist in time, some have a perpetual duration.” Thus the universe as a whole and the celestial spheres in it are both eternal and temporal. They are eternal because they never come to existence in time and never will cease to exist. But they are temporal because they possess their being only through a process of change in a sequence of moments. The same holds true for the psychic realm: all souls are immortal and indestructible; nevertheless, they are continually undergoing change. Therefore, as Proclus says, “‘perpetuity’ (aidiotês) is of two kinds, the one eternal (aiônion), the other in time; […] the one having its being concentrated in a simultaneous whole, the other diffused and unfolded in temporal extension (paratasis); the one entire in itself, the other composed of parts, each of which exists separately in a sequence of prior and posterior.” (Elem. Theol. § 55, trans. Dodds, modified).\nAgainst Aristotle’s critique in De Caelo I 10, Proclus defends the view that the cosmos is “both eternal and generated (genêtos).” As a corporeal being, the universe cannot produce itself and maintain itself in being. It depends for its existence upon a superior cause, and it is for that reason “generated.” This does not prevent it, however, from existing for ever, in an infinite time. As we just saw, Proclus distinguishes between what is eternal in an absolute sense (the intelligible realm) and what is eternal because it continues to exist for the whole of time, what Boethius later called “aevum” in distinction from “aeternum.” As Proclus notices, at the end of the Physics (8.10, 266a27–28), Aristotle himself establishes that no body can possess from itself an unlimited power to exist. If the world exists eternally, it must have this power from an incorporeal principle. Therefore, Aristotle too is forced to admit that the world is somehow generated, though it continues to exist for eternity. For it always receives from its cause its infinite power and never possesses it at once as a whole, because it is limited. The world is eternal, because it has an infinite power of coming to be, not because it exists of infinite power (In Tim. I 252.11–254.18).\nRelated to the eternity of the world is the question of the nature of the celestial bodies. Aristotle argues in De Caelo I 2 that the celestial bodies, which move with a natural circular motion, must be made of a simple substance different from the four sublunary simple bodies (whose natural movements are in a straight line: up or down). This ‘fifth element,’ which is by nature imperishable, is the ether. With this explanation Aristotle seems to oppose the view Plato defends in Timaeus where it is said that the Demiurge made the divine celestial bodies “mostly out of fire” (40a2–4). Proclus admits that the heaven is composed out of the four elements with a preponderance of fire, but he insists that the elements are not present in the celestial bodies in the same mode as they exist in the sublunary bodies. Therefore Aristotle is right when he considers the heavens to constitute a fifth nature besides the four elements. “For in the heavens the elements are not the same as they are here, but are rather the summits of them” (In Tim. II 49.27–29). If one counts the whole heaven composed out of the best of the elements as one nature and adds to it the four sublunary elements, we may speak of five natures altogether.\nContrary to Aristotle, Proclus argues that the whole universe (to pan) is in a place (topos). He can do this because his conception of place differs in many respects from Aristotle’s own. The latter defined place as “the unmoved limit of the surrounding body” (Physics IV 4, 212a21–22). From this it follows as a necessary corollary that the universe as a whole cannot be in a place, because there is simply nothing outside it. Aristotle’s definition, as we learn from Simplicius’ and Philoponus’ Corollary on Place, had been criticized by all later Neoplatonists (Syrianus, Proclus, Damascius, Simplicius, and Philoponus). It is notable that Proclus’ own theory of place, as reported by Simplicius, differs considerably from other Neoplatonic theories in that he considered place an immaterial ‘body’, namely a special kind of immobile light. As emerges from Proclus’ Commentary on Plato’s Republic, his theory took inspiration from the column of light mentioned at Republic X, 616b.\nSince the heavenly bodies were considered divine, because they are eternal and living beings, the study of the heavens was of special importance to Neoplatonists. In the preface to his treatise On Astronomical Hypotheses (a summary and evaluation of astronomical views of his time), Proclus makes it clear that his approach is based on Plato’s remarks on astronomy (especially in the Republic and in the Laws). He feels the need to go through the different theories, because one can observe a great disagreement among ancient astronomers on how to explain the different phenomena (Hyp. I § 33). Fundamental to Proclus’ approach is the distinction between two kinds of astronomy (Hyp. I § 1–3). The first kind contents itself with observing the heavenly phenomena and formulating mathematical hypotheses to explain them and make calculations and prognostics possible. This is the astronomy as practiced by the most famous astronomers before Proclus’ time (Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy). The second, which is developed by Plato in the Timaeus, and is confirmed by the tradition of the “Chaldaeans and Egyptians,” investigates into the intelligible causes of heavenly movements. An example for this approach can be found in his Commentary on Plato’s Republic (In Remp. II 227.23–235.3). There, Proclus explains that the seemingly irregular movements of the planets ought not to be explained by means of Ptolemy’s complicated theory of excentric spheres and epicycles, but are rather due to the fact that the planets are moved by intelligent souls which express in the movements of their bodies “the invisible powers of the Forms” (232.1–4). Yet Proclus appreciates Ptolemy’s astronomy as long as it is seen only as a mathematical-mechanical construction making it possible to calculate and predict the positions of planets, and as long as it does not claim to have any real explanatory value. For the history of astronomy Proclus’ Astronomical Hypotheses remains a most valuable document, since it represents one of the best introductions to Ptolemy’s Almagest extant from antiquity and since it explains the most important ancient astronomical theories, in order finally (in chapter seven of the work) to evaluate them critically. Proclus’ arguments also played an important role in the scientific discussion of the Ptolemaic hypotheses in the 16th and 17th century.\nProclus’ distinctively non-empirical approach towards physics and astronomy also influences his philosophy of mathematics, which is set out in the two prologues to his commentary on the first book of Euclid’s Elements. The first prologue deals with the mathematical sciences in general, while the second prologue focuses on geometry proper. Proclus argues in great detail that the objects of mathematical sciences cannot be derived from sensible particulars by means of abstraction. Because of the imperfect and deficient character of the sensible objects one cannot derive from them objects that are as perfect and as precise as mathematical objects are. Therefore, mathematical objects reside primarily in intellect and secondarily in souls (as logoi). As universal concepts (cf. 3.2) we can grasp mathematical objects by means of recollection (anamnêsis). Since geometrical objects are not universal, but particulars, and since by definition they possess extension, Proclus argues that their place is human imagination (phantasia). Imagination acts as a mirror and provides the mathematical objects which are projected into it by the soul with intelligible matter. By means of the latter geometrical objects gain extension and particularity. As with physics and astronomy, the ultimate aim of geometry is not the study of these extended, material objects. Rather, geometry serves an anagogical task (just as in Plato’s Republic), leading the soul upwards to a study of the true and unextended causes of geometrical objects in the divine mind (In Eucl. 54.14–56.22).\nRelying on Plato, Theaetetus 176a-b late Platonists saw the assimilation to god (homoiôsis theôi) as the goal (telos) of philosophy. Proclus was faithful to this ideal, as is attested by his biographer Marinus (Life of Proclus § 25). There was a fundamental discussion in late Neoplatonism on how this assimilation to the divine was possible for humans. Damascius (In Phaed. I § 172 Westerink) distinguishes two tendencies: Plotinus and Porphyry preferred philosophy, which makes us understand the divine principles of reality through rational explication, while others like Iamblichus and his followers, Syrianus, and Proclus, gave priority to hieratic practice or theurgy (theourgia, hieratikê [sc. technê]). Their different evaluation of respectively theory and theurgy as means of salvation may be explained by their different views on the human soul and its possibilities of ascent to the divine realm. While Plotinus and Porphyry claimed that the superior part of the human soul always remains within the intelligible realm, in touch with the divine principles, and never completely descends into the body, Iamblichus, followed by Proclus, criticised such a view. The soul does indeed wholly descend into the body (Steel 1976, 34–51). Hence the importance of theurgic rites established by the gods themselves, to make it possible for the human soul to overcome the distance between the mortal and the divine, which cannot be done through increasing philosophical understanding. In Theol. Plat. I 25, Proclus expresses his great admiration for the power of theurgy, which surpasses all human knowledge.\nAs stated before (cf. 3.3), the human soul contains the principles (logoi) of all reality within itself. The soul carries, however, also sumbola or sunthêmata which correspond to the divine principles of reality. The same symbols also establish the secret correspondences between sensible things (stones, plants, and animals) and celestial and divine realities. Thanks to these symbols, things on different levels (stones, plants, animals, souls) are linked in a ‘chain’ (seira) to the divine principle on which they depend, as the chain of the sun and the many solar beings, or the chain of the moon. Of great importance in the rituals was also the evocation of the secret divine names. In his Commentary on the Cratylus, Proclus compares divine names to statues of the gods used in theurgy (In Crat. § 46), pointing to the fact that also language is an important means in the ascent to the divine.\nIn the wake of an article of Anne Sheppard (1982), scholars usually distinguish between three kinds of theurgy in Proclus. The first kind, as described in the above quoted treatise On Hieratic Art, was mainly concerned with animating statues (in order to obtain oracles or to evoke divine apparitions) or, in general, with activities related to physical phenomena or human affairs (influencing the weather, healing illnesses etc.) (see Life of Proclus § 28–29). As emerges from our sources, it is this kind of theurgy that involved much ritualistic practice, including hymns and prayers. The second kind of theurgy makes the soul capable of ascending up to the level of the hypercosmic gods and the divine intellect. This second kind too operates by means of prayers and invocations and it seems especially characteristic of Proclus’ Hymns. And finally, the third kind of theurgy establishes unity with the first principles, that is the One itself. This third kind corresponds to the level of the highest virtues (i.e., ‘theurgic virtues’) in the scale of virtues. It is not clear whether some form of ritual is involved here at all. For this last stage of the Platonic homoiôsis theôi the following elements are of major importance: negative theology (culminating in the negation of the negation), mystic silence and the intriguing notion of faith (pistis), which thus enters with a non-Platonic meaning - though even for the latter notion Proclus will search for confirmation in the Platonic dialogues.\nThose who hasten to be conjoined with the Good, do no longer need knowledge and activity, but need to be established and a stable state and quietness. What then is it which unites us to the Good? What is it which causes in us a cessation of activity and motion? What is it which establishes all divine natures in the first and ineffable unity of goodness? […] It is, in short, the faith (pistis) of the Gods, which ineffably unites all the classes of Gods, of daemons, and of blessed souls to the Good. For we should investigate the Good not through knowledge (gnôstikôs) and in an imperfect manner, but giving ourselves up to the divine light, and closing the eyes, to become thus established in the unknown and occult unity of beings. For such a kind of faith is more venerable than cognitive activity, not in us only, but with the Gods themselves. (Proclus, Platonic Theology, I 25, trans. Th. Taylor, modified).\nThat Proclus, who set up his elaborate Platonic Theology in an attempt to rationally justify a pagan religious tradition whose existence was threatened by the upcoming Christian civilization, would have had such an influence in Christian medieval thought might seem surprising. His influence, however, is mainly indirect, as his ideas circulated under the names of other philosophers. There was, of course, a direct confrontation with the works of Proclus in the later Neoplatonic school (via Damascius and Ammonius, 5th-6th cc) and in Byzantium. In the 11th century, Michael Psellus studied Proclus intensively and even preserved fragments of his lost works. One of his disciples was the Georgian Ioanne Petritsi, who translated Proclus’ Elements into Georgian and composed a commentary on it (Gigineishvili 2007). In the 12th century, bishop Nicolaus of Methone wrote a Christian reply to Proclus’ Elements, thus showing indirectly that the work was still attracting interest. Moreover, Isaac Sebastocrator (11–12th century) produced a Christian adaption of the Tria opuscula. Around 1300 Proclus attracted the interest of the philosopher George Pachymeres, who prepared an edition of Proclus’ Commentary on the Parmenides, which was only preserved in a very corrupt tradition, and even composed a commentary to the last part of the dialogue where Proclus’ commentary was lacking. Cardinal Bessarion was an attentive reader of Proclus’ works and possessed several manuscripts. We owe to the interest of scholars such as Psellus, Pachymeres, and Bessarion, the preservation of the work of the pagan Proclus, who had not such a good reputation in theological circles in Byzantium. And yet, the number of direct readers of Proclus before the Renaissance was very limited.\nDuring the Middle Ages Proclus’ influence was mainly indirect, above all through the writings of the Christian author Dionysius the Areopagite and the Arabic Liber de causis. Dionysius was a Christian author writing around 500, who was deeply fascinated by Proclus. He fully exploited Proclus’ works – which he must have read intensively — to develop his own original Christian Platonic theology. He presented himself as a disciple of Saint Paul, a pretence which was generally accepted until the late 19th century, thus giving his works, and indirectly Proclus’ theology, an almost apostolic authority. As Dodds ²1969, xxviii, has nicely put it: “Proclus was […] conquering Europe in the guise of an early Christian.” The well known Book of Causes is an Arabic adaption of the Elements of Theology, made in the 9th century. Translated in the 12th century, the Liber de causis circulated in the Middle Ages under the name of Aristotle, and was considered as a complement to the Metaphysics, offering a treatise on the divine causes. The text entered the corpus of Aristotelian works and was intensively studied and commented at the universities. Thomas Aquinas is the first to have discovered that this work derived in fact from Proclus’ Elements of Theology, of which he had obtained a Latin translation made by his Dominican confrere William of Moerbeke in 1268 (see Thomas Aquinas, Commentary on the Liber de causis, introduction). Moerbeke also translated the Tria opuscula and the huge commentary on the Parmenides, but these works had almost no readers in the Middle Ages. Berthold of Moosburg wrote in the 14th century a comprehensive commentary on the Latin Elements of Theology . The real rediscovery of Proclus started in the Italian Renaissance, mainly thanks to Marsilio Ficino who followed Proclus’ influence in his Platonic commentaries and even composed, in imitation of Proclus, a Christian Platonic Theology on the immortality of the soul. Before Ficino, Nicolaus Cusanus had already intensively studied Proclus in translations. Proclus continued to enjoy wide interest at the turn of the 18th century. Thomas Taylor (1758–1835) translated all of Proclus’ works into English (reprinted by the Prometheus Trust [London]) and tried to reconstruct the lost seventh book of the Platonic Theology. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) aimed at a complete edition of his preserved work. At the beginning of the 20th century we have the great editions of commentaries in the Teubner collection. Renewed philosophical interest in Proclus in the last century started with the edition of the Elements of Theology by Eric Robertson Dodds, and carried on with the edition of the Platonic Theology by Henry Dominique Saffrey, Leendert Gerrit Westerink and, not least, in Germany with the works of Werner Beierwaltes.\nProclus’ complete works (extant, lost, and spurious).\nDodds, E.R., 1933, 19632, The Elements of Theology, Oxford: Clarendon.\nBoese, H., 1987, Proclus: Elementatio theologica, translata a Guillelmo de Morbecca, (Series: KUL, Ancient and medieval philosophy, De Wulf-Mansion centre, Series, 1, vol. 5), Leuven: Leuven University Press.\nSaffrey, H.D., and L.G.

{"text":"Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway walked away from CNN’s Dana Bash in the middle of an interview following Wednesday’s final presidential debate, but she was extremely polite while cutting the interview short.\nConway answered several questions related to Trump’s comments during the debate that he would consider contesting the results of the general election, but an additional follow-up from Bash was the last straw for Conway.\nConway actually answered the question and walked away as Bash tried to ask yet another follow up on the same subject.\nCNN tweeted the exchange, saying Trump’s campaign manager walked away “mid-interview,” but Conway has been extremely accommodating to the media since talking over as Trump’s campaign manager. Check out the video and let us know if you think it’s a big deal.\nIt all started because Trump said he’s not sure he’ll accept the election results come Nov. 8, which quickly became the biggest story of the debate.\n“What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense,” he continued.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T08:54:00Z","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-campaign-manager-kellyanne-conway-cnn-interview-presidential-debate/"}

{"text":"Starting Tuesday, travellers from Europe, the Middle East and Africa will have to provide fingerprints and photos when they apply to visit, work or study in Canada, if they don’t want to be turned away at the border.\nCurrently, foreign nationals are required to obtain pre-authorization to travel to Canada by air, and the biometric check on arrival is an extra step to confirm a person seeking admission is really the same pre-screened individual on the travel documents.\n“Biometric screening has proven effective in protecting the safety and security of Canadians and the integrity of the immigration system. Systematic fingerprint verification allows border service officers to confirm a traveller’s identity,” said Immigration Department spokesperson Shannon Kerr.\n“Biometric screening has also made it easier to identify known criminals at the earliest opportunity in order to prevent them from coming to Canada. It has made it more difficult for others to forge, steal or use another person’s identity to gain access to Canada,” Kerr added.\nSince 2013, personal biometric information has been required of tourists, students and foreign workers from 29 countries including Afghanistan, Burma, Congo, Haiti, Sudan and Syria, as well as the Palestinian territories — all places where many refugees originate and the use of fraudulent travel documents is rampant.\nIn addition, permanent residency applicants from these countries and territory, as well as refugees and overseas refugee resettlement applicants were required to undergo biometric screening. The rule will extend to visitors from Asia, the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas on Dec. 31, when the biometric plan will be fully implemented.\n“Expanding the collection and verification of biometrics to more applicants will strengthen immigration and border screening processes by confirming a person’s identity,” said Kerr.\nSince the requirement rolled out in 2013, Canada has collected biometric information from 1,066,806 students, foreign workers and tourists, resulting in matches to 760 Canadian criminal records, 1,951 previous asylum claimants and 157,105 previous immigration applicants, said Kerr.\nThe fingerprints, stored by the RCMP in the “national repository,” are valid for 10 years and must be renewed when they expire.\nVisa-exempted nationals coming to Canada as tourists who hold a valid electronic travel authorization from Ottawa.\nChildren under 14 or applicants over 79.\nHeads of state and government.\nForeign nationals travelling to Canada must go to a Canadian visa application centre and pay a fee of $85 per person — or $170 for families — to cover the collection of fingerprints and a photograph. The centre is responsible for transmitting the records to and from the immigration offices.\nAt airports and land ports of entry, the Canada Border Services Agency will check a visitor’s fingerprints against the record submitted by the visa centre in its database. Automatic fingerprint verification is available at eight major airports: Toronto Pearson, Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Pierre Elliott Trudeau in Montreal, and Halifax.\nAuthorities can deny entry to people with unmatched fingerprints, detain them and send them back.\nThe biometrics initiative is part of a joint border security information-sharing arrangement with the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and the U.K.\nBoth the U.S. and Australia require fingerprints and a photograph from visiting foreign nationals, except Canadians. In the U.K., foreign nationals from outside the European Economic Area have to apply for what’s known as a biometric residence permit, while New Zealand currently requires the biometrics of asylum seekers, refugees applying for resettlement and deportees.\nBiometrics are not required of Americans applying for work or study permits and coming to Canada as tourists.\nCorrection - July 31, 2018: This article was updated from a previous version that said all permanent residency applicants and those seeking asylum within Canada, regardless of their country of origin, are already required to undergo biometric screening. In fact, prior to July 31, permanent residency applicants from 29 countries and one territory, as well as refugees and overseas refugee resettlement applicants were required to undergo biometric screening.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T22:35:00Z","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2018/07/28/travellers-from-europe-middle-east-africa-now-must-provide-fingerprints-when-applying-to-visit-canada.html"}
{"text":"Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had just declared victory in the Nevada caucuses when most campaign reporters heard Jeffrey Berman’s voice for the first and only time.\nBerman, Sen. Barack Obama’s director of delegate selection, chimed in during a conference call with the media to make an unexpected case: Despite Clinton’s popular vote victory in Nevada and an authoritative Associated Press count giving Clinton the edge in the Nevada delegate count, Obama had actually won the state by the only measure that mattered.\n“Obama had a majority in the district that had an odd number of delegates, so he won an extra seat,” Berman told the puzzled press; the Associated Press delegate expert, on the call, promised to revise his count.\nObama’s Nevada delegate victory was widely viewed at the time as a curiosity, an asterisk to Clinton’s win. But in February, as Obama amassed delegates despite losing big states, the shape of the race became clear: The name of the game was delegates.\nIt was the game Berman and a friend, Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, had been playing all along. And as Clinton’s staff scrambled after Super Tuesday to remake her strategy to meet that reality, it began to become clear that Berman had helped build Obama a lead too big to surmount.\n“He is the unsung hero of the Obama effort,” said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic consultant who supports Clinton.\nThe bearded, no-profile 50-year-old lawyer’s central role in Obama’s likely nomination is emblematic of the depth of Obama’s preparation for the 2008 campaign.\nClinton’s delegate chief is the much-heralded, oft-profiled, tough-talking past master of the party’s rules, Harold Ickes. But Ickes had a broad portfolio that included fundraising and politicking, a lobbying and consulting business, and a sideline in bitter infighting — all conducted while Berman was concentrating solely on tasks such as hashing out the details of the mixed Texas primary system and arranging obscure Puerto Rican political deals.\nBerman’s counterpart on the staff level in the Clinton campaign, meanwhile, is a former New York State Democratic Party official new to the delegate hunt.\nBerman, by contrast, 25 years ago joined the very small fraternity of Democratic operatives steeped in the obscure — and typically unrewarding — subfield of delegate selection. It’s a job description that begins with getting the candidate on the ballot with full delegate slates in 50 states and extends through building a whip operation for a possible floor fight at the convention.\nIn the middle is the crucial process of setting a campaign’s strategy for amassing the maximum number of delegates — a mind-numbing blend of math and politics that will focus a candidate’s energies on congressional districts in which the math of proportional representation gives him or her a chance to pick up an extra delegate or run up a big margin.\nSince Gary Hart and Walter Mondale battled toward the nomination, this particular political skill also has been a waste of time: Democratic contests have been decided early.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T06:28:37Z","url":"https://www.politico.com/story/2008/05/the-obama-campaigns-unsung-hero-010249"}

{"text":"Kirill Kudryavtsev, AFP | In this file photo taken on January 22, 2017 people walk in downtown Astana (now renamed Nursultan), with the Baiterek monument seen in the background.\nKazakhstan's new interim president was sworn in Wednesday following the shock resignation of the country's long-time ruler and in his first official act renamed the capital after his predecessor.\nKassym-Jomart Tokayev took office in a pomp-filled ceremony less than 24 hours after Nursultan Nazarbayev, the only leader an independent Kazakhstan had ever known, suddenly announced he was stepping down.\nTokayev immediately proposed changing the name of the Central Asian nation's capital from Astana to Nursultan, or \"Sultan of Light\" in Kazakh, and parliament approved the change within hours.\nThe senate also appointed Nazarbayev's eldest daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva as speaker, setting her up as a potential contender to succeed her father.\nTokayev, 65, will serve out the rest of Nazarbayev's mandate until elections due in April next year, though the former president retains significant powers in the country he ruled for nearly three decades.\nTokayev told lawmakers that Nazarbayev had \"shown wisdom\" by deciding to step down, a rare move in ex-Soviet Central Asia where other leaders have stayed in power until death.\n\"Yesterday the world witnessed a historic event,\" Tokayev said, hailing Nazarbayev as a visionary reformer.\n\"The results of an independent Kazakhstan are there for all to see,\" Tokayev said.\nNazarbayev changed the capital from Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty to Astana in 1997, transforming it from a minor provincial town into a futuristic city of skyscrapers rising from the steppes.\nIts name meant \"capital\" in Kazakh and there had long been speculation of a renaming after the leader who shaped it.\nThe city is central to government propaganda highlighting the achievements of Nazarbayev's reign and his journey to build it was recently the subject of a state-funded film, \"Leader's Path: Astana\".\nNazarbayev, 78, ruled Kazakhstan since before it gained independence with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\nHe steered the country through a major transformation, developing huge energy reserves and boosting its international influence, but was accused of cracking down on dissent and tolerating little opposition.\nNazarbayev will continue to enjoy significant powers thanks to his constitutional status as \"Leader of the Nation\", life-time position as chief of the security council and head of the ruling Nur Otan party.\nTokayev appeared to be in pole position to take over in the long term until senators voted shortly after his swearing-in to name Nazarbayeva, 55, as their new chief.\nShe is the most politically prominent of Nazarbayev's three children and has long been mooted as a potential successor.\nKazakhstan's deputy prime minister from 2015 to 2016, Nazarbayeva has significant influence over the media.\nAnalysts said it was too early to declare a clear frontrunner to become the next elected president, with the recently named prime minister, 53-year-old Askar Mamin, another possible contender.\nTokayev, the interim president, has a strong diplomatic record dating back to the Soviet period and has twice been foreign minister.\nThis should go some way to reassuring Kazakhstan's major partners including China, the European Union, Russia and the United States that the move will not threaten key relationships.\nBut analysts are in two minds over whether he has the attributes to take the job beyond the term that Nazarbayev would have served.\nAs Tokayev alternated between Russian and Kazakh in his speech in the parliament on Wednesday, he appeared notably more comfortable in Russian.\nIndependent political analyst Dosym Satpayev said that language skills are closely scrutinised by Kazakh speakers tired of the dominance of Russian.\n\"In terms of Kazakh language, we cannot say that Tokayev is as comfortable as the first president. This is an important issue in the long term as over 60 percent of the population is Kazakh and this demographic is expanding,\" Satpayev said.\nBut Satpayev also said that Tokayev's diplomatic skills had helped him forge a careful career path through an elite prone to clannishness and regionalism.\n\"He is capable of negotiating between different groups and taking different interests into account. He lacks popular recognition to some extent but he is a heavyweight in the bureaucracy.\"\nThe new leader will need to tackle growing discontent over falling living standards after Kazakhstan's economy was hit by the 2014 drop in oil prices and sanctions against Russia, a key trading partner.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T18:40:23Z","url":"https://www.france24.com/en/20190320-kazakhstan-capital-new-president-astana-nursultan"}

{"text":"A lot of folks say they don’t like okra, but the deer at New Moon Farms just south of Loganville love it. They also love green beans, watermelon, cucumbers and sunflowers. And they don’t even wait for the vegetables to grow or the sunflowers to blossom. They just nibble the young plants right down to the ground.\nThat’s been Mike Moon’s experience this year. About the middle of May, he planted 10 200-foot long rows of okra, each seed dropped in six inches from its neighbor. That’s 2,000 row feet of okra. And no sooner did the plants come up, then the deer came in and ate the tender young seedlings.\nThe land he’s farming has been in the family since the early 1800s.\nNow a firefighter in Loganville, Moon has 13 more years until retirement and is planning to keep farming right up until retirement and beyond. He hopes to pass along at least some of the land to his children.\nAnd he isn’t giving up on okra. In mid-July he prepared to plant okra again, although this time under plastic mulch. He’s growing Clemson spineless green okra, the same variety his grandfather planted when Moon was a young child.\nIf a farmer keeps his okra picked, he’ll have new pods coming along right up until frost. Picking okra can be an itchy job, although Moon doesn’t find himself bothered by the prickly hairs of the okra plants. His mother and wife don’t have the same immunity, so they use gloves when they’re harvesting.\nFortunately, his customers like okra prepared in many different ways. He sells to restaurants like Graft in Grayson, to local produce stands like Three Peas in a Pod in Loganville and to local residents.\nAnd he takes it to his booth at the Saturday morning Snellville Farmers Market. His new crop should be ready to harvest in early September, if the deer will let the plants grow.\nRobbins is a loyal supporter of local farmers and farmers markets.

{"text":"Centralizing the procurement process, diversifying supplier portfolios and assessing the capabilities of each manufacturing partner will allow enterprises to mitigate the impact of or eliminate product recalls.\nIn 1982, 31 million bottles of Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol were recalled, costing the company more than $100 million. An order for the bottles to be returned was incited after seven people around in the Greater Chicago area were killed after consuming tablets laced with potassium cyanide.\nBridgestone/Firestone recalled an estimated 6.5 million tires after Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers equipped with those tires experienced tread separation. Not only did Bridgestone spend $440 million on the ordeal, Ford's bill amounted to a whopping $3 billion, not including the $600 million in lawsuits incited by individuals who either sustained major injuries themselves as a result of the tires or were taking legal action on behalf of deceased relatives.\nIn 2004, Merck, a pharmaceutical company, recalled arthritis drug Vioxx after research discovered that people who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months were likely to suffer heart attacks and strokes. First, Merck lost $725 million in potential Vioxx sales. Then, three years later, the company paid $4.85 billion in settlements, resolving a whopping 27,000 lawsuits.\nAs one can see, the human and monetary costs associated with recalls can be quite ugly. From what can be gleaned by these two incidents, purchasing management professionals should not only assess what materials are going into the products they're selling, but how item design can impact customer safety.\nCoffee machine manufacturers aren't exempt from request for returns, either. According to IndustryWeek, Keurig Green Mountain is recalling an estimated 7.2 million single-serve hot coffee brewing units due to a previously unnoticed burn risk. Apparently, users have reported being scalded because of a malfunction that causes the machines to spray hot water. The recall requests owners return their Keurig MINI Plus Brewing Systems, model number K10, with serial numbers beginning with 31.\nWhat can be learned from this incident? While the parts used to assemble these machines should have been scrutinized more carefully by designers and procurement specialists, the construction of the units should also come into question. Blueprinting may not be a direct concern of the purchasing department, but it's a phase that should never be taken for granted.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T03:13:05Z","url":"https://www.strategicsourceror.com/2014/12/leveraging-strategic-sourcing-to-reduce.html"}

{"text":"KEI KECIL, Indonesia: It is believed by many on the Kei Islands that some of their earliest ancestors came from Bali, braving the long expanses of sea to the west.\nThose original descendants, countless generations ago, jumping from one island to the next, found a home in Kei. They brought religion and culture to a truly remote part of the world, a paradise that largely still exists in raw form.\nWhere Bali has exploded into one of the world’s best known holiday escapes, Kei’s location - closer to Darwin in Australia than Jakarta - has left it in a long shadow. From a state of seclusion adrift in the Banda Sea, the islands’ magic has been left untapped.\nThere are no beachside cocktail bars or luxury resorts in sight. Instead, the gentle waves lap onto some of the world’s finest untouched sand, so ethereal and white that the locals compare it to flour.\nBali receives as many foreign tourists per day as Kei has had in total over the past seven years. There is a staggering gulf in fortunes when it comes to modern development.\nBut under the administration of Indonesian President Joko Widodo, the development of eastern Indonesia has come into focus. He wants to attract investors to spur economic growth in eastern Indonesia, where significant challenges exist compared to the more populous west. For instance, poor connectivity has seen commodity prices soar for local populations.\nHowever, the resulting massive infrastructure projects rolled out in recent years, including roads and airports, as well as the investment in vast internet networks, has the remote region well placed to take advantage of a growing curiosity of domestic and foreign travellers to explore the country’s outer reaches.\nLong after the intoxicating days of pirates and spice in this part of the world, once at the centre of a global tussle for cloves, nutmeg and mace, a new bounty is being uncovered.\nKei is starting to enjoy the riches of the government’s attention. The airport is built for a future growth in capacity, the roads are surprising in their size and quality and 4G coverage even reaches budding Instagrammers on outer atolls surrounded by lively coral reefs.\nGetting to Kei Kecil remains a challenge to all but the equally intrepid and well-heeled. Domestic flights from Jakarta, connecting in Makassar and Ambon, still cost hundreds of dollars each way. Schedules are still limited but more frequent flights - and some building competition between Garuda Airlines and Lion Air - suggest fares could eventually drop.\nLocal tourism authorities now want to ignite the industry and create a “mini Bali”. It is a marketing tag thrown around regularly in Indonesia but Petrus Renwarin, the secretary of tourism in South East Maluku, says Kei’s ambitions have substance.\nThey are building cooperation with Bali authorities, using ancestry links as a contemporary connector between the two destinations.\n“There is a more permanent strategy looking at how they can help us. If the tourists go there we can divert them to come here as well,” Petrus said.\nTourism is a new concept for Kei residents, but many are showing a keen desire to be involved.\nOn Wab Beach, an exquisite stretch of waterfront, a local man was busy hammering and sawing under the shade of a grove of coconut trees. He was constructing a warung, a simple restaurant, as part of a community effort to attract visitors to the area. Nearby, other stalls were being put together, hammocks stretched between trunks and a social media-ready swing framed by the shimmering waters was ready to be snapped.\nA couple of years ago, 65-year-old Alfred Inuhan said, no-one from Wab would have ever seen a foreigner padding across the sand or wading in the shallows. Today, they are still rare, but he is hoping that will soon change.\n“We want a lot of of foreign tourists to come,” he said. His simple hospitality is just a start, he says, and he welcomes larger scale tourism investment, on his land or in the area, even if the sight of bikini-clad visitors would come as quite a shock for some.\n“We really understand that tourists come but they will not change our culture. I believe that Bali in the beginning was also like that but sooner or later it has changed, since I already visited Kuta and have seen that myself.\n“Kei culture is about respecting one another. Whoever they are, we respect them,” he said.\nOne of the local tourism industry pioneers based near Kei’s best known beach, Pasir Panjang, a pristine three-kilometre stretch of powdery sand, has doubts about plans to attract more people.\nGeeryt Martin Tarantyin started one of Kei’s first guesthouses after visiting the island, the traditional home of his father, back in 1989. He continues to run the rustic beach lodgings with his wife Lucy, attracting backpackers, families of explorers and curious Jakartans.\n“When people come here they think I live in a paradise,” he said, explaining that in the past the only way to reach Kei was by taking ferries that slowly traverse the seas, connecting the archipelago as far as Batam, near Singapore.\nThat isolation brought challenges, but also protection. Now, he fears local and investors alike may have good intentions but cultural misunderstandings are inevitable.\nPetrus confirmed that five-star developments would be developed “in the near future” but Tarantyin says local beliefs similar to voodoo could stand in the way.\nLand ownership is problematic in Kei because of the possible effects of ‘sasi’, meaning prohibition. It is a powerful superstition invoked throughout Maluku, a kind of unseen magic that locals cast onto property or land to ensure others cannot possess or use it without proper permission.\nIn 2003, the bridge between the island’s two main towns, Tual and Langgur, had sasi placed upon it due to a land dispute. No-one dared to cross for months, until officials remedied the situation and held a ceremony to remove it.\nIn the case of a prospective hotel on Kei, entire communities would need to have their say on the sale or lease of land. Land is communal, not owned by individuals and negotiations can be lengthy and difficult.\n“If you want to buy ground here, the whole community needs to know and approve. If you miss one family, maybe they can put sasi,” Tarantyin said.\nPetrus says having united decisions about the future of Kei will bring about togetherness. From land use to conservation and protection of the environment, he wants locals to have a stake. It is the Kei way.\n“Local people are very proud when the tourists come,” he said. “We have the custom of accepting people no matter what.\nThe local government is yet to introduce concrete economic plans to assist villagers navigate a possible looming tide of outsiders, rather it is providing “the spirit” to help push them forward.\nPromotion is mostly being left up to informal groups, like a collection of youth under the umbrella Kei Paradise. They are harnessing Instagram to expose Kei to the world.\n“We are promoting an unknown destination,” said one of its founders, Rudolof Stanislaus Rettob.\n“We often sell Kei as a complete destination. But since it is far away, there are lot of obstacles. Many tourists say that they prefer to go to Singapore rather than Kei, because of the cost, not just the distance.\nIn the meantime, Rudolof and his partners continue to explore their own home, discovering more - the hidden beaches, cascading waterfalls, mysterious caves and limestone formations - all with the hope that others too, will be enraptured by what Kei holds.\nThe lure of the horizon, the idyllic, the unknown. It is something these islanders’ ancestors might have understood quite well.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T04:52:50Z","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-beach-tourism-kei-islands-bali-10776444"}

{"text":"Renting an apartment with bad credit may not be easy. Many large apartment complexes owned by corporations now require credit checks and will refuse applicants who do not meet their standards. Even if you have the income to pay for the apartment, you may still be refused if your credit score is too low.\nIs Renting an Apartment with Bad Credit Possible?\nOne way to solve this problem is to bypass the credit issue entirely. Many privately-owned homes and apartment buildings do not look at credit, preferring to find tenants with good references from previous landlords. You can find advertisements for privately-owned rentals in the classified section of your newspaper, on the internet at sites like Craig's List and Rental.com, as well as through local real estate agents.\nMany local homeowners and condo owners rent their houses because they are having trouble selling them in the current real estate market, so you may be able to find a very nice property at a reasonable rate, provided you are a good tenant and are willing to keep the place clean and in order.\nHowever, more and more private owners are looking at credit checks as one way to separate the \"good\" tenants from the \"bad\" tenants. If you are forced to deal with the credit issue, you can salvage some of the damage by handling your bad credit report in a proactive way.\nStep #1: Clean up your credit.\nFirst, get a copy of your credit report and check it carefully. You can get a credit report from your bank or by contacting the \"Big 3″ credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. You are entitled to one free copy from each per year; you can also request additional copies at a cost.\nReview your credit report carefully and get someone such as a banker or financial manager to go over it with you if you do not understand it. You can also find internet sites which translate the terminology and abbreviations on your report.\nNext, dispute any inaccurate information. Sometimes companies report a late payment incorrectly, or you may have been charged for something you did not purchase. If you dispute a transaction, it is up to the lender or seller to prove that you were truly late with your payment or that you did not pay a bill. If the seller or lender cannot prove this, the credit bureau will remove the bad credit from your report.\nStep #2: Talk to your potential landlord.\nOnce your credit report is clean, you are better able to determine if it will be a report that will trigger a \"no\" with prospective landlords. If you had a few late payments to a hospital five years ago, you are far less likely to be turned down by a landlord than if you had three evictions last year from apartment complexes for non-payment of rent.\nUse common sense when analyzing your credit report; if you are unsure how something will impact your rental prospects, ask the landlord what type of information they gather when looking at a credit report. Be honest if you have had late payments in the past, and ask the agent or representative of the rental company if this will disqualify you from renting. Surprisingly, in many cases, it won't.\nStep #3: If necessary, find a cosigner.\nYou can also use the cosigner option. If you have a parent, spouse or friend with good credit who is willing to sign for you, renting an apartment with bad credit is often no problem. Of course, this is because the landlord knows that your cosigner will be on the hook for any rent you do not pay.\nThis is a terrible option to take if you are unable to pay the rent in a timely manner, because you will not only be hurting your own credit, but that of someone else. If you do know someone willing to cosign, you must commit to making your payments every month, on time.\nStep #4: Be prepared to pay up front.\nFinally, you may be approved for an apartment rental in spite of bad credit, but have to pay more up front or per month. Some larger corporations have instituted measures whereby those with poor credit can still rent, but have to pay much larger security deposits. Generally, the security deposit is reflective of how much rent you would pay during the time it takes to evict you for non-payment of rent.\nFor example, suppose you pay $600 a month for your apartment and it takes 90 days to evict a tenant in your state. Expect to pay around $1,800 in additional security money up front, as the landlord will want that money in escrow in case you default on your rental payments.\nThis post originally appeared on Go Banking Rates.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T21:26:50Z","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/you-can-still-find-your-dream-apartment-even-with-a-crappy-credit-score-2012-3"}
{"text":"Position dovetails with French stand; Olmert tells Mitchell IDF op gave PA chance to reassert in Gaza.\nIn a sign that the international community's position on Hamas is weakening, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana would not say unequivocally Wednesday during an interview with The Jerusalem Post that the EU should stick with the three preconditions it set for talking with the Islamist group. Solana's comments came as US special Mideast envoy George Mitchell arrived in Israel on what Israeli officials described as a \"stock-taking\" mission. One of the major issues on the agenda was consolidating the cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. Ever since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, the international community has largely isolated it, saying it must recognize Israel, forswear violence, and accept previous Palestinian-Israeli agreements. Since Operation Cast Lead, however, there are an increasing number of voices in Europe saying this policy is anachronistic, and that a way must be found to deal directly with Hamas. Asked his opinion, Solana said, \"We want to move in a political dynamic, that political dynamic is impossible to have outside two basic parameters.\" Solana said those two parameters were a two-state solution and the Arab League peace initiative. Solana's comments dovetailed with efforts by some in Europe, led by France, to drop recognition of Israel as a condition for talking with Hamas, saying it would be enough if Hamas accepted the Arab peace initiative, which calls for a two-state solution, and which would then be tantamount to tacit recognition of Israel. Foreign Ministry officials said this position weakened the Israeli and US argument that there are moderate Palestinians with whom it is possible to work, and extremists who must not be given legitimacy. \"It is clear that some in Europe are looking for a way to deal with Hamas,\" one official said. \"They are willing to give up on the need to recognize Israel. But that is a cornerstone of our policy.\" He said Israel would diplomatically fight any changes to the three conditions, and that letting Hamas in \"through the back\" door would only weaken the Palestinian Authority and President Mahmoud Abbas. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in his meeting on Wednesday with Mitchell, said Hamas had emerged weakened from Operation Cast Lead, and there was now an opportunity for the PA to reestablish itself in some form inside the Strip. Olmert also talked about the Gaza border crossings with Mitchell, saying that while they would be open for humanitarian assistance, they would not return to \"full, routine functioning until the issue of Gilad Schalit is solved.\" According to Olmert's office, the two men also spoke about the diplomatic process, with Olmert repeating his commitments to a two-state solution, the Annapolis process, and the road map peace plan. He also reiterated to Mitchell the importance of former US president's George W. Bush's letter to Ariel Sharon stating that the US recognized that facts on the ground had changed since 1967 and would have to be taken into consideration when drawing up future borders, and that the US would not support a right of Palestinians refugees to return to pre-1967 Israel. Mitchell also met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who, according to a statement issued by her office, said that while Israel believed in the two-state vision, Palestinian refugees would not be allowed into Israel. Other top Israeli officials, including the Defense Ministry's Diplomatic-Security Bureau chief Amos Gilad, Deputy Defense Minister Matan Vilna'i and Israeli Ambassador to the US Sallai Meridor later joined the meeting between Barak and Mitchell. Mitchell also met President Shimon Peres. The US envoy, after meeting Olmert, issued a brief statement saying that \"the prime minister and I discussed the critical importance to consolidate the cease-fire, including the cessation of hostilities and an end to smuggling, and the reopening of crossings based on the 2005 agreement. President Obama has said the US is committed to Israel's security and to its right to defend itself against legitimate threats.\" Mitchell, who did not take any questions from the press, said Obama had made clear that the US \"sustain an active commitment toward reaching the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security.\" Before coming to Israel, Mitchell met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo, and following their talks told reporters that the Gaza cease-fire was \"critical.\" \"The United States is committed to vigorously pursuing lasting peace and stability in the region,\" he said. On Thursday, Mitchell is scheduled to meet Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, Mossad director Meir Dagan and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) head Yuval Diskin. He will then go to Ramallah for a meeting with Abbas and PA Prime Minister Salaam Fayad. On Friday he is scheduled to meet Likud head Binyamin Netanyahu, before going to Amman. He is also scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Paris and London before returning to Washington early next week.

Since then, the space has sat vacant.\nA new building will now be built that will expand the current property by 25,000 square feet. The new building will include children’s classrooms, a children’s worship area, a new nursery, and new church offices. The building will be used for not just Sunday but for the church’s Mother’s Day Out program.\nThe project will also include the building of “The Reich Chandler Great Hall” which will connect the new education building and sanctuary.\nReich Chandler was a church member and the son of George and Martha Chandler. After graduating from Lufkin High School in 1985, he went to Baylor University to study law. Chandler practiced law in Houston and Dallas before returning home to practice with his father.\nSadly after battling cancer for 15 months, Chandler died in 2006 at the age of 39.\nThe Chandler family was in attendance.\nThe groundbreaking is the beginning of a three-month process.

{"text":"I am compelled to get the word out regarding a Senate bill that could adversely affect private preschools in California. The bill is labeled SB 837 or Kindergarten Readiness Act of 2014. This bill is written with good intentions, but the implementation is a problem. The bill written by state Sen. Darrell Steinberg is asking for approval to provide free preschool to all 4-year-olds — a noble idea. Because of how the author and co-authors have chosen to fund the bill, it places these 4-year-olds in our public school system. I would imagine any person in the field of early childhood development; teacher, psychologist and doctor would oppose this bill.\nThe bill states that through longitudinal studies it has been found that those children who attended quality preschool programs had higher graduation rates, college enrollment rates and earning rates. This is what preschool educators have provided for years. Four-year-olds still need help developing social skills and gaining confidence. They need space inside and out allowing them to explore their environment. This will not happen at an elementary school. Elementary schools predominantly have blacktop as the surface outside. Inside the classroom, the environment will not be warm and inviting as in a quality preschool and won’t have the supplies needed to create and invent.\nWhat about working parents that need an after-school program? After a certain time of day, the young children will more than likely be mixed in with the older children (as it is now). Again, not appropriate. The funding cannot be used to upgrade facilities for 4-year-olds; meaning they will make do with what they have in place, which is suited for 5 years and up. Let’s also talk about whether or not your local school has space to house a whole new age of children. Will class sizes grow in the other grades to make space for the younger children?\nIf this bill passes how it is written, with parents unable to access the funding and choose a quality preschool, we feel that a great number of private preschools will have to shut their doors. Most preschools have 50% of children age 4, which also helps the schools differ the costs of the younger children who require smaller class sizes. As we have seen through the already implemented TK classes in the public schools, parents will leave a preschool they have to pay for, if another one is free. If we can’t keep our doors open because of losing half our clientele then who will service the families with younger children? This bill could impact preschools, teachers, vendors and families.\nLet’s put aside all the financial ramifications. My passion is and has been helping shape the minds and spirits of young children. I have been in the field for 23 years, first as a teacher and now as a director of Parents and Children’s Nursery School in La Cañada. None of us in our field do our jobs for the paycheck, because there isn’t much of one. We do it because we are passionate about helping young children understand who they are and how far they can go.\nWe need to keep enriching our children with experiences, music, art and expression. A quality program embraces the whole child. Children leave us with the love of school and the curiosity needed to learn. We need our artists, musicians, scientists and writers as well as our leaders in business. Our public school system has already taken away so much from our children. Do we want them to take it away even sooner?\nMARJI GOLDEN is a resident of Glendale.

{"text":"(CN) – A federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld Mississippi’s three-drug method of lethal injection on the ground that the inmates challenging it had filed their complaint too late.\nDeath-row inmates Alan Walker, Paul Woodward, Earl Berry, Dale Bishop and Gerald Holland sued the state in October 2007, claiming that the lethal-injection procedure constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Berry and Bishop have been executed since the filing.\nThe 5th Circuit said their complaint is time-barred, because the procedure could be challenged as early as 1997, and the state never hid its lethal-injection procedure. The limitation period for the inmates’ actions accrues from the date of their convictions and sentencing, the court ruled, or when the state changes its execution procedure. The plaintiffs’ actions accrued between 1998 and 1999.\nWhen the state moved for summary judgment based on the three-year statute of limitations, the inmates argued that it did not apply because their lawsuit sought an injunction, not damages. The plaintiffs also argued that even if the statute of limitations applied, the action did not accrue before the Supreme Court’s rulings in Hill v. McDonough (2006) and Baze v. Rees (2008).\nBut the circuit characterized the complaint as a personal injury action, despite the injunction request, and said the action is subject to a time bar.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T10:22:19Z","url":"https://www.courthousenews.com/lethal-injection-lawsuit-filed-too-late-court-says/"}

{"text":"Vote Leave has been blasted on social media for a “subversion of democracy,” as an outraged public reacts to allegations that the group cheated to win votes in the 2016 Brexit referendum.\nLawyers acting on behalf of Brexit whistleblowers Chris Wylie and Shahmir Sanni are calling for the Electoral Commission to investigate allegations that the group exceeded campaign spending limits. In a 50-page dossier, the lawyers claim Vote Leave circumvented the limit by donating £625,000 ($885,000) to pro-Brexit student BeLeave group, to which it was closely linked.\nThe donation, however, was allegedly used for Vote Leave, bringing its total spending over the legal limit of £7 million ($9.9 million), breaching electoral law.\nThe dossier is largely based on witness statements by former Cambridge Analytica employee Wylie, and Sanni – a volunteer who worked at both Vote Leave and BeLeave. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Wylie said the dossier contains evidence undermining the legitimacy of the EU referendum result, which could prompt a new one to be held. Vote Leave has strongly denied any wrongdoing and said the £625,000 donated to BeLeave in the final days of the 2016 campaign was within the rules.\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson, a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, also denied any wrongdoing, tweeting a denial. In turn, Channel 4 News challenged Johnson directly to answer questions live on air.\nTom Brake, the Liberal Democrat’s Brexit spokesperson, said the allegations were “stunning,” adding: “The British people expect fair play and campaigns to abide by the rules – they must not be cheated. These allegations must be examined by the police. If they represent what happened it is outrageous and shameful.\n“The referendum had a very narrow outcome.

{"text":"A report this weekend by Axios cited documents from within the National Security Council describing the possibility — nay, inevitability — of a 5G network built and operated by the U.S. government. Officials have since poured cold water on this idea, and really, it was never feasible.\nIn brief, the report cited by Axios suggested that the only way to truly secure the next generation of wireless networks, on which critical infrastructure like self-driving cars will rely, against snooping by China and others, would be for the government to build that network itself.\nThere are several things wrong with this idea. You probably thought of a couple before you even got to this sentence.\nThat would be awkward, since those companies, along with others around the world, are well into the process of testing and deploying 5G networks. The idea of a government network operating separately but in concert with the commercial networks doesn’t hold water (we’ve considered it before).\nEven if it was attempted, there’s just no way that the U.S. government, even at its best and most efficient, and if it started bipartisan work on this tomorrow, could be in any way competitive in the timing and scale of such a deployment. It takes billions of dollars and years of work to lay the foundation for something like this, and others have a huge head start. And let us not forget that we are experiencing one of an endless series of budget crises, which would not be alleviated by the proposal of this kind of massive undertaking.\nI oppose any proposal for the federal government to build and operate a nationwide 5G network. The main lesson to draw from the wireless sector’s development over the past three decades—including American leadership in 4G—is that the market, not government, is best positioned to drive innovation and investment. What government can and should do is to push spectrum into the commercial marketplace and set rules that encourage the private sector to develop and deploy next-generation infrastructure. Any federal effort to construct a nationalized 5G network would be a costly and counterproductive distraction from the policies we need to help the United States win the 5G future.\nThe United States’ leadership in the deployment of 5G is critical and must be done right. Localities have a central role to play; the technical expertise possessed by industry should be utilized; and cybersecurity must be a core consideration. A network built by the federal government, I fear, does not leverage the best approach needed for our nation to win the 5G race.\nWhile I’m glad that the Trump Administration recognizes that maintaining American leadership in the information age requires a significant investment commitment, I’m concerned that constructing a nationalized 5G network would be both expensive and duplicative, particularly at a time when the Administration is proposing to slash critical federal investments in R&D and broadband support for unserved areas.\nThe Trump administration itself told Recode that the document Axios saw was dated, and that it wasn’t a seriously considered proposition. The National Security Council doesn’t oversee broadband deployment, and there’s no way this would get past the FCC, which as you can see above would likely be united in opposition to such a strategy.\nAnd although the NSC clearly has national security in mind when it suggests this path, I frankly would not trust the government to build a secure network of any kind, let alone one this big. There would also be considerable irony in a government attempting to secure its internet infrastructure while simultaneously attempting to undermine effective encryption.\nThe U.S. government may very well use part of the 5G network being built for its own purposes, and it of course subsidizes the rollout of the tech so it can use it itself — first responder networks, military stuff, that kind of thing. But the idea that it would, or could, build a competitive 5G network in the manner suggested has no basis in reality.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T18:40:53Z","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/theres-no-way-the-government-is-building-its-own-5g-network/"}

Use one space between the city and state and two spaces between the state and ZIP code.\nUse the ZIP+4 code if you know it. The ZiP+4 code contains the usual five-digit ZIP code followed by a hyphen and four additional numbers. The additional numbers makes it easier for the Postal Service to locate the recipient.\nLegibility is important. Use black ink and avoid fonts that are hard to read.\nDon’t place any text below the city, state and ZIP code. The Postal Service automatic processing machines scan envelopes from the bottom up. If you place anything other than city, state and ZIP code on the last line, you’ll confuse the machine, which could delay delivery of your envelope.\nMcGurgan, Holly. \"Correct Way to Address a Business Envelope.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/correct-way-address-business-envelope-57164.html. 08 March 2019.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T00:14:43Z","url":"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/correct-way-address-business-envelope-57164.html"}
{"text":"Published: Sept. 18, 2013 at 09:44 a.m.\nUpdated: Sept. 19, 2013 at 02:04 a.m.\nThe Cleveland Browns spent the offseason touting a quarterback competition between Brandon Weeden and Jason Campbell that, from the start, felt like a mirage.\nThat's exactly what it was.\nWith Weeden sidelined by a sprained thumb, coach Rob Chudzinski announced Wednesday that Brian Hoyer, not Campbell, will start Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings.\nHoyer, listed as the Browns' third-string passer, will make just his second NFL start. Last December, he started in a 27-13 loss to the San Francisco 49ers as a member of the Arizona Cardinals.\nHoyer was signed in the offseason to pad Cleveland's quarterback room. For anyone following the team closely, his arrival felt inevitable.\nThe former New England Patriots quarterback is a favorite of new general manager Michael Lombardi, who during his tenure with NFL Network repeatedly touted Hoyer as a starter-in-waiting. Before Chudzinski was brought aboard, coaching candidates Ray Horton, Ken Whisenhunt and Bill O'Brien each told Browns' brass they would add Hoyer to the roster if they landed the gig.\nAdd it all up, and Campbell's demotion is no surprise. He is what he is. A strong-armed passer with accuracy issues who struggles to generate points. Hoyer, if nothing else, brings a dash of mystery to the role.\nBesides, Chud hinted this was coming. After Weeden was hurt in Sunday's 14-6 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the coach said Monday that both backups were in the running to take over.\nThat opened the door for Hoyer to hopscotch Campbell, who must wonder today what his future holds in Cleveland.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T20:41:25Z","url":"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000246560/article/brian-hoyer-to-start-at-qb-for-cleveland-browns"}
{"text":"Opinion|Should I Give Up on White People?\nShould I Give Up on White People?\nMr. Yancy is a professor of philosophy at Emory University.\nGlenn Ligon, “Palindrome #1” (2007), neon, 8 x 105 inches.CreditCreditPhotograph by Farzad Owrang/Glenn Ligon; Image courtesy of the artist; Luhring Augustine, New York; Regen Projects, Los Angeles; and Thomas Dane Gallery, London.\nYou deserve to be punished with several fists to your face! You’re nothing but a troublemaker! I’ve had enough of your Racist talk! You’d better watch what you say and to whom you say it! You may just end up in the hospital with several injuries or maybe on a cold slab in the local morgue! You’ve got a big mouth that needs to be slammed shut permanently!\nLocal morgue? Slammed shut permanently? These threatening words are taken from a letter sent to me by an anonymous white person. It was handwritten in black ink, covering both sides of a yellow sheet of paper torn from a legal pad. It is one of hundreds of letters, emails, postcards and voice messages I received — to say nothing of menacing discussions of me on white supremacist websites — after I wrote and published the essay “Dear White America” in December 2015 here at The Stone. What I had offered as a letter of love had unleashed the very opposite — a wave of white hatred and dehumanization.\nAfter receiving the letter that spoke of a cold slab and shutting my mouth permanently, I decided to share it with my students in my graduate philosophy seminar. I needed a witness — perhaps I needed my students to help carry some of what I was feeling. So, I read it aloud.\nI had not anticipated my emotional response. As I read the letter, I began to feel a different kind of threat. The kind of threat that has implications for those whom I love. You see, a threat to my life will inevitably impact the lives of my loved ones. And that is a threat that impacts me, my body, my spirit, with a different kind of existential and emotional gravitas.\nWhen I finished reading the letter, I looked at my students as I thought about the reverberations of such a threat. My eyes watered, my body became stilted, I felt a rush of unspeakable anger run through my blood. I said to my students: “This involves my loved ones. I can’t take this hatred anymore! I need a few minutes outside of class.” The room fell silent.\nWell, that didn’t happen. I came back into the room, where everyone was still silent. My students’ faces, for the most part, were turned down. I know what they had felt, black students, students of color and white alike. They bore witness to my vulnerability, my suffering, the sting of unmitigated hatred. And they saw the impact in an otherwise safe academic space.\nA few moments passed. I apologized to them and resumed teaching. But the space between us in the classroom was not the same; we had witnessed something together. That space will never be the same.\nI wanted to model for my students what it is like to be a contemporary philosopher who remains steadfast in the face of hatred. I wanted them to internalize something of what it means to practice philosophy, to love wisdom, in the face of danger, threats of violence and intolerance. Yet, there was a part of me that failed that day.\nMy composure had collapsed. I seemed to have lost my bearing, my confidence was shaken. I was pushed to rethink what I assumed was a mission of love, the kind of love that refuses to hide and requires profound forms of vulnerability. I had wanted to help heal our broken world, to exalt love in an otherwise ethically catastrophic America. Now I could hear the voices of some of my students of color, “Dr. Yancy, why do you continue to write about whiteness and to address white people?” There is affection and alarm in that question, concern for my safety. And it is a reasonable question.\nGiven such nasty, unconscionable, violent and perhaps liable discourse, why do I continue to speak to white America about its racism? After all, I am not a masochist, nor do I want to be a martyr.\nIt is true that being on the receiving end of such hate caused me to grow weary, fatigued and profoundly pained. Mixed with all of that was the outrage I felt when “white innocence” was uncovered as white privilege and white complicity with systems of white racism. I had become, as the civil rights heroine Fannie Lou Hamer once said, “sick and tired of being sick and tired.” And in so many ways, and for good reason, I still am.\nSo, here I am facing a dilemma. Do I give up on white people, on white America, or do I continue to fight for a better white America, despite the fact that my efforts continue to lead to forms of unspeakable white racist backlash?\nI am convinced that America suffers from a pervasively malignant and malicious systemic illness — white racism. There is also an appalling lack of courage, weakness of will, spinelessness and indifference in our country that helps to sustain it. That indifference is itself a cruel reality, a reality that often makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs until I fall flat on my face from exhaustion. That indifference makes me sick to my stomach.\nWhen it comes to white racist hatred, America never seems to have short supply. Perhaps you believe that I exaggerate. But I know better. You see, many whites in America have no need of me. They refuse what James Baldwin called a disagreeable mirror, one that shows them what they would rather not see.\nWhite people have told me where to go: “Yancy, flights leave for Africa every day. We can all admit bringing you to this country was a mistake, so let us get rid of you and correct the mistake. You are not happy, we are not happy with your behavior, so do it.” Or “There are two ways you can return to Africa: On a passenger ship, or in a coffin freighter. Choose quickly.” Notice the urgency of that warning, the implied threat to my life.\nBeheaded ISIS style? A meat hook? Kill myself? Reader, the sickness of these threats should trouble your very soul.\nJames Baldwin writes, “People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.” White America has long lost its innocence. Given its horrendous treatment of the indigenous peoples of this land, there was never any innocence. There were monsters, though. Land takers. Brutal dispossession. And then body snatchers and the selling and buying of black flesh. To be haunted while asleep has its advantages, because one will awake. But to be haunted while awake by a teratology of whiteness is far more frightening.\nIn response to these positive responses, however, some will still insist, “Their white history speaks louder than their words.” But history, I say, is not fixed. And as human beings we are protean.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T08:35:28Z","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/opinion/white-racism-threats.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region"}
{"text":"Green Bay -- The Green Bay Packers have agreed to terms on a three-year deal with wide receiver James Jones, a source told the Journal Sentinel.\nAccording to the source, QB Aaron Rodgers and WR Donald Driver went to bat for Jones with Packers management and might have had some influence in the Packers stepping up with a good offer. It's true that Jones' options were drying up after the Minnesota Vikings signed WR Michael Jenkins and the New York Jets signed Plaxico Burruss.\nBut Jones could have stayed out on the market and waited until some team had an injury and reaped a decent reward. Instead, he and the Packers came to terms on a deal this morning that will reunite him with his Super Bowl teammates.\nRodgers spoke to reporters less than an hour ago but about the importance of re-signing Jones and running back John Kuhn.\nOther teams had some concerns about Jones' drops and were unwilling to pay him the kind of money he was looking for. The Vikings settled on Atlanta's Michael Jenkins and the Jets settled on former Giant Plaxico Burruss.\nThat really left the Packers as the only team left, but Jones still had leverage in that he didn't have to return to the team now. So, his agent, Frank Bauer, and Packers negotiator Russ Ball, kept working on a deal that both could live with.\nReached by phone, Bauer admitted that Rodgers and Driver really pressed Packers management to re-sign Jones. You'll never get GM Ted Thompson to admit a player influenced his decision to re-sign a player, but Jones is a popular teammate and with the Eagles acquiring cornerbacks Nnmadi Asmougha and Dominique Rogers-Cromartie, you had to wonder if the coaches felt they needed him back.\n\"I don't know many quarterbacks who could have done that other than Peyton Manning,\" Bauer said. \"He and Driver really stepped up. That's rare for a quarterback and receiver to do that. That's really neat. James is really excited about coming back. He's very happy.\"\nThe Packers bring back their top four receivers and add second-round pick Randall Cobb to the mix. Jones and Jordy Nelson still have to clean up their issue with dropped passes, but this gives coach Mike McCarthy options if one receiver is hot and the other isn't.\nThrow in the return of TE Jermichael Finley and the addition of rookie TE D.J. Williams and the Packers should be able to create at least one very favorable match-up against each opponent. The onus now will be on the offensive line to protect QB Aaron Rodgers so he can get them the ball.\nAlso, LB Nick Barnett sent out a Tweet that said \"Go Bills\", which means he apparently has signed with Buffalo.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T00:40:50Z","url":"http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/126484058.html"}

{"text":"CLEVELAND – Two women -- one with a ticket, one tearfully without -- laid claim to a $162 million lottery jackpot Tuesday, triggering a legal dispute that could come down to \"finder&apos;s keepers\" or fraud.\nElecia Battle (search) went to police Monday with the teary story of a lottery ticket lost outside a convenience store, and a small crowd with flashlights soon gathered in the snowy parking lot in search of the precious paper scrap.\nTuesday morning, Rebecca Jemison (search) said Battle&apos;s claim prompted her to quit stalling, submit her ticket and collect the prize from the Dec. 30 drawing.\n\"I was angry at first, but not worried at all,\" said Jemison, 34. \"I knew what I possessed.\"\nPolice, who originally said Battle, 40, had told a credible story about losing the winning ticket, are now investigating whether she lied in a police report, a misdemeanor punishable by 30 days to six months in jail.\nJemison turned in the ticket for the 11-state Mega Millions (search) jackpot at Ohio Lottery headquarters. The lottery validated it Tuesday as the sole winning ticket for the drawing and Ohio Lottery Director Dennis Kennedy said the lottery is confident Jemison bought the ticket, not found it.\nAs proof, Jemison provided another ticket purchased at the same time and place as the winning ticket and had an outdated lottery ticket that showed she had played the same numbers in the prior drawing, Kennedy said.\nBattle immediately filed suit Tuesday seeking to halt any payout to the winner.\n\"My ticket was lost. I do recall all the numbers. They are all somehow family-related. No one can tell me what I did and did not play. I did it honestly and I have no doubt,\" Battle told The Associated Press at the office of her attorney, Sheldon Starke.\nBattle&apos;s suggestion on television that she had bought and lost the winning ticket \"made me laugh,\" Jemison said.\n\"Let authorities handle her,\" she said. \"It&apos;s very unfortunate that someone would think of something like this.\"\nThe lottery commission had no immediate comment on the lawsuit, said spokeswoman Mardele Cohen. Jemison, who said she had waited to come forward because she wanted to speak with a lawyer and accountant, could not be reached for comment after the suit was filed.\nJemison, who handles telephone and doctor paging duties at a suburban hospital, said she is looking forward to buying a new home, taking a vacation and sharing her prize with her family. She and her husband, Sam, have a 12-year-old daughter.\nShe took her winnings in an immediate lump sum of $94 million, before taxes. After taxes, it will be worth an estimated $67.2 million.\nSouth Euclid, meanwhile, is expecting its own windfall to the tune of about $1.4 million in taxes from the prize. The Cleveland suburb had been expecting a $1 million deficit for 2004, and Mayor Georgine Welo laid off 11 employees last week.\nWelo said Tuesday the unexpected income tax will make life easier in South Euclid, and that she likely would soon rehire two of the laid-off workers.\nEarlier Tuesday, Starke, unaware that the lottery was validating Jemison&apos;s claim, said he intended to make a case that the winning ticket was Battle&apos;s lost property.\n\"If there is one type of property that is not presumed to be abandoned, it&apos;s money,\" he said. \"Anyone who finds it is not the owner.\"\nThe Ohio Lottery says the ticket is a bearer note, which means whoever turns in a valid ticket is legally entitled to the winnings.\nAfter learning that Jemison turned in the winning ticket, South Euclid police Lt. Kevin Nietert said he had not been able to reach Battle and her attorney by phone. \"From a police department point of view, it obviously draws into question the integrity of Elecia Battle&apos;s report.\"\nThe winning ticket was sold at Quick Shop Food Mart in South Euclid, about 15 miles east of Cleveland.\nBattle filed a police report saying she dropped her purse as she left the store after buying the ticket. She said she realized after the drawing last Tuesday that the ticket was missing and told police that the numbers she picked represented family birthdays and ages.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T08:00:06Z","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/story/woman-sues-to-stop-payment-to-lottery-winner"}
{"text":"Before SAP Labs designed its new digs in Palo Alto, company executives asked employees how to make it a welcoming place to work. After all, that’s where they spend most of their day.\nThe answer? Windows. Lots of windows letting in lots of light.\nThe German-based business software company complied – even going so far as to move executives away from windows to give more workers access to daylight.\nAs the country embraces “green” building design – be it in the workplace or at home – daylight has become a premium. Not only does it save energy – more sunlight means less bulb light – but research shows that workers with access to natural light are more productive.\n“Your mind is pretty powerful. If you feel more connected naturally, you perform better,” said Alan Turner, principal of the Mountain View architectural firm Hawley, Peterson and Snyder, which designed the Hewlett Foundation’s Menlo Park headquarters, one of California’s first buildings to earn a gold rating from the U.S. Green Building Council.\nPerhaps, but recent studies supporting the productivity claim are helping architects convince developers that such green features are good for business – everybody’s business. Not only can landlords charge more for the space, but companies can achieve better results from their employees.\nLisa Heschong, founder of Heschong Mahone Group in Sacramento, has spent years studying the connection between people and sunlight. In 2003, Heschong studied workers in a Sacramento Municipal Utility District call center to discover whether natural light plus a view made any difference.\nBased on a 1999 analysis she performed with shoppers and schoolchildren, she already knew that natural light caused shoppers to buy more and students to perform better in school. But in the study requested by the California Energy Commission, she wanted to analyze worker productivity and whether it mattered if people had a view.\n“We found really, really big effects,” said Heschong, who studied two call centers operating 12 hours a day with 100 employees. In each study, employees with views outside their windows answered and processed calls 7 percent faster than employees doing the same work without a view.\nNo one is exactly sure why people perform better with a view, but Heschong has a theory. It has to do with circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycle in the physiological processes of living beings.\nWhile the data was compelling, when it was released four years ago there was little if any construction under way in the U.S. commercial real estate market, and Silicon Valley was experiencing one of its worst downturns in history. Now that the construction pipeline is bulging with commercial projects, the research is beginning to resonate with companies planning new buildings, as well as the developers in charge of building them.\nIn fact, after years of watching developers’ eyes glaze over when he mentioned environmentally friendly design, David Hobstetter, principal at KMD Architects in San Francisco, has seen a change.\nOne developer who’s already on board is Jay Paul Co. of San Francisco, currently building Silicon Valley’s largest development in five years, the 1.8-million-square-foot Moffett Towers. Matt Lituchy, chief investment officer for Jay Paul, said bona fide research linking light with worker productivity helps make the case for designing buildings with more natural lighting.\nThe seven-building, eight-story Moffett Towers offer what Lituchy called a “curtain wall” of floor-to-ceiling windows, with floors that measure 38,000 square feet, allowing more light to reach the buildings’ interior. In comparison, much of the valley’s older building stock has floors that are two and three times as large, and not much if any light reaches inside. None of the Moffett Towers buildings has leased yet, but Lituchy said the interest is high.\nTo critics who say such construction costs too much, architects counter that green design is no longer more expensive than standard design because more suppliers have entered the marketplace, bringing down prices.\nCompanies have also discovered that offices designed to make workers more comfortable pay for themselves. Standard industry norms say that during a building’s 30-year life cycle, a company will spend 90 percent of the costs on salaries for its workers; 3 percent on energy for lighting, heating and cooling; 4 percent on operating the building; and 3 percent on constructing the building.\n“If we can achieve a minor improvement in productivity – and good daylighting has demonstrated that you can get 7, 8 or 10 percent improvements in performance – you pay for the bricks and mortar,” said Hobstetter, whose firm is designing the San Francisco headquarters for the Public Utilities Commission, touted to be the greenest building in the country.\nRoney said that bolstered with the research, he has little trouble convincing the bosses to give up the corner office with a view so more people can enjoy it. Especially in Silicon Valley, where companies lure workers with such features as chef-prepared meals, massages and dry cleaning service, it stands to reason that offices with views would not be a tough sell.\n“All companies are realizing that their most important asset is their people,” Roney said.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T02:51:52Z","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/10/08/daylight-makes-workers-brighter/"}
{"text":"Wait, Did Trump’s EPA Just Do Its Job for a Change?\nLook at that beaut. Volvo’s all-electric truck, the Volvo FL Electric.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday it plans to better regulate the pollutants spewing out of heavy-duty trucks. Yes, this is the same EPA that wants to keep coal power plants alive, plans to scrap regulations on mercury emissions, and does not care about fuel efficiency.\nCould Trump’s EPA actually be doing something helpful for our planet and health for a change? Maybe! But let’s not get too ahead of ourselves here.\nThe proposed “Cleaner Truck Initiative” seeks to decrease nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from heavy-duty trucks, which can worsen or help spur asthma and other respiratory issues when inhaled regularly. These gases can also help contribute to the formation of smog. Nitrous oxide, a form of nitrogen oxide, also warms the planet, making up 6 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe proposal to tighten NOx emissions standards, which have not been updated since 2001, began under former President Barack Obama. And while it’s a rare sign of progress for Trump’s EPA to push forward with an Obama-era regulation, this one still doesn’t go far enough, said Mustafa Ali, former environmental justice administrator at the EPA.\nThe U.S. emitted 14.1 million tons of NOx in 2011. In 2014, roughly half of those emissions were from vehicles. Most of those come from vehicles running on diesel like heavy duty trucks, according to a 2017 EPA document. If we were really serious about decreasing this (and all other) truck pollution, it’d mean going electric.\nObviously, this is easier said than done: Implementing a nationwide ban on fossil fuel trucks would require a complete infrastructure makeover that’d switch out gas stations for charging stations to support these vehicles. And of course, charging stations would need to run on renewable energy for the electric vehicles to be better for the environment. If the EPA even took the miraculous step of mandating zero truck emissions, industry officials and likely even state governments would be pissed and challenge the proposal in court.\nNothing about it would be easy.\nBut it wouldn’t be impossible, and radical change is becoming increasingly necessary as the threat of catastrophic climate change looms. And other countries are stepping up. Spain, for example, proposed Tuesday to remove all gas-powered cars from its roads by 2040. Other European countries and cities are also moving forward with fossil fuel car bans. If the U.S. is going to update these standards, why not go all the way?\nHe’s right: In 2017, University of Washington researchers published findings on nitrogen dioxide emissions nationwide, which largely come from transportation, and found that people of color experienced higher exposure to this pollutant between 2000 to 2010. That’s why advocacy organizations like the Moving Forward Network have been urging the EPA to implement zero-emissions technologies in heavy-duty trucks since at least 2016.\nThe communities that live day to day exposed to pollution from truck traffic are sure to welcome any relief. The EPA could always, however, go a step further to ensure no communities need to bear the burden of unhealthy air.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T08:15:17Z","url":"https://earther.gizmodo.com/wait-did-trump-s-epa-just-do-its-job-for-a-change-1830439364"}
{"text":"Najib arrives at the Kuala Lumpur High Court.\nKUALA LUMPUR - Disgraced former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has been out in recent weeks campaigning as if for an election, trying to shed the image of a wealthy, elite politician and elicit public sympathy before his corruption trial begins next Tuesday (Feb 12).\nThe trial starts nine months after Malaysians voted Najib out of office in a general election dominated by public disgust over allegations some US$4.5 billion (S$6.1 billion) was stolen from 1MDB, and about a quarter of it went into his personal bank accounts.\nPolice found nearly US$300 million worth of goods and cash at properties linked to Najib soon after the May 2018 election.\nThe 65-year-old son of Malaysia's second prime minister is also trying to build an image as a folksy voice of working people, especially members of the ethnic Malay majority.\nNajib, in a viral video last month, crooned a Malay-language version of the 1970s hit Kiss And Say Goodbye, surrounded by a chorus of sombre young singers, criticising Mahathir's coalition for failing to live up to election promises.\n\"On May 9, 2018, I was ousted. All this time, I have been fighting with my life for the people I love. But what can I do?\" an earnest Najib says of his \"saddest day\" in the introduction to the song.\nNajib has also been hitting out online. His jibes against ruling party politicians on Facebook and Twitter have some social media users referring to him as \"King of Trolls\".\nA relaxed, casually dressed Najib also paid a visit this month to Langkawi, Mahathir's island constituency, where he pottered around town, visiting markets, eating at hawker stalls and rubbing shoulders and posing for selfies with passers-by.\nMahathir was not impressed. He told a news conference last week Najib seemed to be getting popular on social media because \"he provides a lot of stories\".\nHarvinderjit Singh, one of Najib's lawyers, declined to comment on the former premier's public appearances but said the 1MDB trials were unlikely to be affected by the hoopla.\n\"The case is going to be determined by what happens in court, not out of it,\" he said.\nWhile Najib has been trying to build public support, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) has been building a formidable team to prosecute Najib, his wife and a host of other former top officials charged for corruption. All of them have pleaded not guilty.\nThe prosecution has been recruiting top-notch criminal attorneys including former federal court judge Gopal Sri Ram and Sulaiman Abdullah, a lawyer with a background in cases of white-collar crime.\nSeven of those charges will be the subject of Tuesday's trial, relating to transfers totalling RM42 million (S$14 million) into Najib's personal bank account from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.\nProsecutors have handed nearly 3,000 pages of documents to the defence ahead of the trial, said Najib's lawyer Singh.\n\"Our client is of the view that if he gets a fair trial, then the truth will show itself to the public,\" he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T08:05:54Z","url":"https://www.asiaone.com/malaysia/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-gears-graft-trial-charm-offensive"}

Medical advances in recent decades mean male hair loss can be treated, and it need not break the bank.\nThe cause of male pattern baldness is well established as an act of nature not nurture. Identical twins go bald at the same age, rate and pattern, irrespective of diet, lifestyle or stress levels.\nThere's no need to go bald any more.\nBaldness is a complex polygenic trait: up to five genes are involved, and it is the interplay between these genes, not unlike the interaction between the cards in a poker hand, that determine the specifics of male pattern hair loss.\nSo, what are the treatment options?\nFinasteride is a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved drug that dermatologists and general practitioners have been prescribing to treat hair loss for about 15 years.\nIt works by stopping the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in the prostate, by blocking an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.\nYou'll need a prescription for finasteride, and your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of the drug before you decide to proceed.\nThe benefits are clear: men who start taking daily finasteride at the first signs of hair loss will not go bald. Plus there are no interactions with other drugs.\nBut there is a small risk of sexual side effects such as such as erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory problems and reduced libido, which require careful management by an experienced doctor.\nAn added bonus is that finasteride reduces a man's future chance of developing of prostate cancer, though it does not increase longevity, as the reduction in risk is exclusively for low-risk prostate cancer, which is not the type men generally die from.\nThe cost for a year's supply of tablets starts at as low as about $200 (plus the extra you will need to put aside for haircuts!).\nDeveloped in the 1950s as a tablet to treat high blood pressure, minoxidil was an abject failure because of unwanted hair growth. Reinvented as a lotion applied directly to the scalp, it was launched in the United States in 1988 and soon became popular around the world.\nMinoxidil is also TGA-approved and available over the counter in pharmacies for between $15 and $60 a month, depending on the brand.\nNo prescription or trip to the doctor is required, but talk to your pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, especially high-blood-pressure medication.\nHair removal laser has led to a renaissance in the use of minoxidil tablets, as doctors can now effectively manage the unwanted hair that was previously a deal breaker. Low doses of minoxidil, as low as one-40th of a tablet, can still grow hair with minimal effect on blood pressure and no need to put anything in your hair.\nWhile finasteride works best at arresting progression of genetically programmed hair loss, some men will achieve partial regrowth. The sooner you begin treatment, the more hair there is to protect.\nMinoxidil is better at stimulating new growth rather than preventing progression. A bit like the bank manager who lends an umbrella when the sun is shining, and wants it back when it starts to rain, minoxidil works better before you go bald. Men who still have hair regrow more hair than men who have lost it all.\nWhen used together, the combination of minoxidil and finasteride is a man's best chance to both arrest hair loss progression and maximise hair regrowth.\nMen whose hair is too far gone to be saved by tablets and lotions might consider hair transplantation surgery, a cosmetic surgical procedure that has improved dramatically in recent years.\nVarious techniques are available, but all involve taking hair-bearing skin from one part of the scalp and grafting these pieces of skin onto bald or thinning areas of the scalp.\nThe main downside, apart from the cost ($5000 to $10,000, depending on the number of grafts required) is the linear scar left behind on the back of the head, locking men into long-hair styles.\nAnother option is follicular unit extraction. Rather than a strip of skin and a scar, donor tissue comprises multiple tiny punch grafts that heal invisibly by wound contraction. Further dissection of these grafts releases single hair follicle units that can be implanted one by one into the bald scalp to recreate a natural hair line.\nThe only limiting factor for follicular unit extraction is whether there is enough remaining donor hair to transplant. While chest and body hair have been used when donor hair is poor, artificial hair implants, also TGA-approved, remain the last resort. Artificial hairs cover the scalp but do not grow and grey and regenerate like hair transplants.\nWhat about other suggested treatments such as vitamins, dietary supplements, lasers, stem-cell therapy and platelet-rich plasma? At this stage the most generous interpretation of the available data is that they are unproven, expensive and poor value compared with the TGA-approved treatments.\nThe take-home message for boys staring at their bald fathers' scalp and wondering what their genes have in store for them is, don't panic, but don't leave it too late.\nRodney Sinclair is Professor of Dermatology, Honorary, Epworth Hospital at the University of Melbourne.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T21:08:42Z","url":"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/starting-to-thin-out-hair-loss-doesnt-have-to-lead-to-baldness-20150119-12tg15.html"}

To be clear: we do not want these events in our stores. Some anti-gun activists have also played a role in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction, including soliciting and confronting our customers and partners.\"\nPeople who continue to bring guns into Starbucks, wrote Schultz, will not be asked to leave. Nor will the company put up any signs about its new policy.\nSo what will change? Not much. It may tick off a few gun toters. It may endear Starbucks to those who have grown sick of our swaggering gun culture.\nBut in the end, will it prevent the next mass shooting?\nWhen it comes to policies aimed at preventing gun violence, we're just shooting blanks.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T14:53:35Z","url":"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-navy-yard-gun-control-20130918-story.html"}

{"text":"Metaphysics special: Do we have free will?\n“DID I really just decide to have fish and chips for lunch?” Humans have been wrestling with such questions for millennia. Maybe not about the fish and chips, but about whether we are truly in control or whether some external agent – be that an omnipotent god or the laws of physics – predetermines the trajectory of our lives.\nUnfortunately, there are no easy answers. Who is the “I” who decided to have fish and chips? Your gut reaction might tell you that you are a conscious entity controlling your physical body. But that physical body includes the brain that generates your consciousness. There is no splitting the two.\nMetaphysics special: What is consciousness?\nWe do know that any sense we have of being in control of our actions is, to some extent, an illusion. In particular, neuroscientist Benjamin Libet showed in the 1980s that mechanisms within the brain initiate actions long before that brain’s owner is aware of deciding to perform them.\nIt’s a big extrapolation to claim that all of our actions are outside our control. “Libet deals with the very short-term precursors of very simple actions,” says Patrick Haggard, a neuroscientist at University College London. Then again, even longer-term decisions and actions are the result of specific brain processes. “I assume this is also deterministic,” says Haggard.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T07:51:22Z","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130890-700-metaphysics-special-do-we-have-free-will/"}

{"text":"When Apple unveiled the all-new Apple TV with an all-new remote during its iPhone 6S September event, it glossed over some really interesting features for the new set-top box.\nSo, we have created this feature to tell you about a few of them.\nThe new Apple TV is now available to buy, starting at £129 in the UK and $149 in the US, and it comes with a fresh operating system, sleek interface, and voice-command functionality, to name a few things.\nWith that in mind, and to help you better understand what else is awesome about the latest version of Apple's set-top box, we've dug through all the details and rounded up 14 of the coolest features.\nWe can't delve into Apple TV features without first addressing one major change: Apple has added a new operating system to its set-top box. The new software offers an interface that's pretty similar to the old interface, though Apple has cleaned it up and replaced the black background with white.\nApple is calling its new operating system \"tvOS\". It is based on iOS, with various modifications added, such as support for the new remote. Beyond the interface, core aspects of tvOS include voice search through Siri, universal search across apps, a full-fledged app store, support for gaming, and more.\nThe new Apple TV is all about apps, thanks to the new Apple TV App Store, which Apple wants developers to make exclusive tvOS-based apps and games for.\nGilt Groupe's CEO, Michelle Peluso, showed off the new Gilt app designed specifically for Apple TV during the unveiling of the device. She showed how you can scroll or swipe with the new remote to navigate through the Glit app.\nBuy-now buttons appear on carousel views and product pages, for instance, and so with a simple press of the new remote, you can buy stuff. Netflix, Hulu, and HBO have also released new apps for tvOS.\niTunes Movies has been redesigned as well, while the Apple Music app will soon deliver Beats 1 radio.\nThe Apple TV has a new remote with motion-sensing capabilities. It's a slim controller decked out with a touchpad and buttons for menu, home, volume, and Siri. The dual mics for Siri are located at the top, while the black touchpad is cloaked in glass and clicks (much like the MacBook's trackpad).\nYou'll also notice a small IR port for issuing volume commands to your TV. And at the bottom, there's a Lightning port for charging the remote's battery (supposed to last three months on a single charge). Although you won't find a power button, it can turn new TVs on/off if they have HDMI CEC.\nThe remote also connects to Apple TV over Bluetooth 4.0, so there's no need to point it at the box.\nSo, the touchpad lets you navigate through the new interface by sliding your finger across its surface, but as if that wasn't enough, you can turn the remote sideways to turn it into a controller for gaming.\nThe remote has built-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, meaning it acts like a Wii controller.\nThe Apple TV comes with a new remote, and we noted below how you can use it to rewind or skip forward, but did you know it can also cue up information?\nA downward swipe on the trackpad will bring up details on what you're watching.\nWe've already told you the Apple TV lets you play games using the new remote. But if your friends don't have a remote, don't worry. Up to four players can join a game with their iPhones or iPod touches. Apple told Pocket-lint after the event that the new Apple TV will support third-party gamepads as well.\nDuring our hands-on, we had a look at the SteelSeries Nimbus controller, which can be used to control one player, while the remote, your iPhone, or iPad can be used to control other players.\nApple TV comes with support for Siri, bringing voice-controlled, smart search to the set-top box.\nAll results are sorted by popularity, and when you ask Siri to find a movie, TV show, or song, she'll search not only iTunes, but also Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and HBO. You can also conduct searches by actors and genres. You can say, for instance, \"Show me Bond movies\" or \"Just the ones with Sean Connery.\"\nThis is where things get clever. Apple has quietly included something Google previously described as conversational search. So, you can have a conversation with Siri in order to narrow your choices.\nSiri won't just fetch stuff for you; she'll also scrub for you. She can move whatever you're watching forward or backward. All you have to say is: \"Siri, skip back 15 seconds\" or \"What did he/she say again?\" But if you don't want to use Siri for that, you can also click and slide on the new remote to scrub.\nLet's not forget that Siri is a digital assistant first and foremost, and that's no different with the Apple TV. She can pull up weather reports or answer your questions, and she'll display all answers and results along the bottom of your display. If you want that in full-screen, swipe up on the remote.\nThe new iPhones are capable of recording 4K videos at 30fps, and you'll of course be able to play them on your television through Apple TV, but because the new box doesn't support 4K, all videos will be downgraded to 1080p.\nIt's been rumoured that the new Apple TV would launch with support for HomeKit - Apple's framework that is meant to simplify the current state of home automation. Apple was dodgy when asked directly if it included such integration, though it said HomeKit is in the tvOS SDK for developers.\nSo, theoretically, developers could one day make apps for HomeKit-enabled devices that deliver notification through Apple TV. You might also be able to control those devices using Siri. But that's all just speculation for now.\nIf you lose the new remote to your new Apple TV, you can program any third-party one to work with the set-top box. Just go to Settings > General > Remotes > Learn Remote. From there, choose a setting or button that doesn't control another device, and then select Start. You should see the six buttons of the Apple Remote, which you can map to your new remote. To do so, press and hold each button until the blue progress bar is done.\nIf you share your Apple TV with others, you can set up separate accounts using individual Apple IDs so you don't have to share your content with others. It's simple to do: from the Home screen, go to Settings > Accounts > iTunes and App Store. From there, select Add New Apple ID and enter an Apple ID.\nClick Continue, then add the Apple ID password, and select Sign In. Sign out and repeat the process to add another account, them go to Settings whenever you want to switch between accounts. Simples.\nThe new Apple TV home screen lets you change the default icon order. All you have to do is use the new remote; select an icon by pressing down on the touch surface, and you'll then get vibrating icons (similar to what you see on iOS). Then, you can swipe left, right, up, or down to move the icon around.\nWhen you're done, press the touch surface to set everything in place.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T10:09:44Z","url":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/apple/135249-14-cool-features-and-other-things-you-can-do-with-the-new-apple-tv"}

Greg Abbott refused to pick sides Wednesday in a growing squabble over how best to cut state taxes, and moved away from an earlier promise to “insist” that Texas lawmakers cut property taxes before the session ends on June 1.\n*Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\nGov. Greg Abbott refused to pick sides Wednesday in a growing legislative squabble over how best to cut state taxes, and moved away from an earlier promise to “insist” that Texas lawmakers cut property taxes before the session ends on June 1.\nAt a press conference coinciding with the dreaded April 15 income tax filing deadline, Abbott hailed the Legislature’s heated debate over taxes as a sign of fiscal health when other states are struggling financially.\nAbbott said he still feels property taxes are too high and noted that cutting them is “definitely on the table.” He was referring to the $2.15 billion property tax proposal being pushed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the Tea Party Republican who presides over the Senate.\nIn a statement Wednesday afternoon, Patrick repeated his support for the property tax cut.\n\"I agree with Governor Abbott that I too will not support any budget that does not have franchise tax relief,\" Patrick said. \"I also will not support any budget that does not have property tax relief, as well.\"\nBut in his remarks to reporters, Abbott also suggested that sales tax cuts — being pursued by House leaders who have battled with Tea Party-backed lawmakers and activists — represent another legitimate alternative.\n“There is the possibility of property tax reduction. There is the possibility of sales tax reduction on top of the margins tax reduction,” Abbott said.\nHouse Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, issued a statement saying he was \"certain the House and Senate will work well together in the final weeks of the session.\"\nShortly before Abbott spoke, more than 100 conservative activists rallied outside the Capitol to mark Tax Day, the impetus for some of the original Tea Party protests several years ago.

Melo also served as Fort Bragg”s mayor between 2000 and 2004.\nMelo, 69, was shot to death Saturday morning when he and a companion stumbled on an opium poppy garden while looking for an illicit marijuana grow site on private timber land near the Noyo River and the Skunk Train rail lines, about four miles east of Fort Bragg.\nCal Fire announced Tuesday that it closed Camp One and the public firewood gathering areas of the Jackson Demonstration State Forest until further notice, and authorities are urging the public to stay out of the entire forest while the manhunt for the alleged gunman continues.\nDetails about the shooting and suspect Aaron Bassler, a Fort Bragg transient in his 30s, are emerging as the Mendocino County Sheriff”s Office continues to lead the multi-agency search. The search focuses on a six-mile area from the Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg east to Northspur, in and around the forest.\n“We have no reason to believe he left the forest area,” MCSO spokesman Capt. Kurt Smallcomb said Tuesday.\nMelo and a friend, whose identity hasn”t been released, went into the remote, rugged terrain looking for an illicit pot garden Saturday morning, intending to report the garden”s GPS coordinates to law enforcement — something Melo did frequently in his property management capacity with a local timber company, according to Smallcomb.\nThe men instead found a garden of more than 100 opium poppies Bassler was allegedly growing, according to Smallcomb. He said Bassler was on higher ground and began shooting down at the men from about 10 yards away, using a high-caliber, “high-powered” long rifle of an SKS type that some said was an automatic weapon.\nSmallcomb could not confirm that the weapon Bassler allegedly used was automatic, or its caliber.\nMelo was unarmed, but his companion exchanged gunfire with Bassler and was then able to escape, running “a long way” before hitting a lucky break, according to Smallcomb. He met a Skunk Train rail maintenance car and rode with it, calling law enforcement on a cell phone when he reached an area with better cell reception, Smallcomb said.\nMelo died of multiple gunshot wounds, according to the results of a Monday autopsy.\nAuthorities do not believe Bassler was hired to guard the garden, but was growing it himself, according to Smallcomb. He said authorities believe Bassler was also associated with illicit marijuana growing in and around the area where Melo and his companion were searching.\n“Marijuana has historically been all through the area,” Smallcomb said.\nMelo would frequently search the timber land for illicit pot gardens and report their GPS coordinates to law enforcement in his property management capacity to keep the properties clean, according to Smallcomb.\n“We were in weekly contact with him,” Smallcomb said.\nDan Gjerde, a fellow Fort Bragg City Councilman, posted on Facebook Tuesday that he remembered last seeing Melo at an Aug. 16 meeting the Board of Supervisors held in Fort Bragg.\n“It was just days after the murder of Matt Coleman,” Gjerde writes, referring to an Aug. 11 incident where Coleman was shot and killed while conducting property management on rural property near Cape Vizcaino, between Westport and Rockport, for the Save the Redwoods League.\nBassler has a history of misdemeanor convictions dating back to 2001 and prior, according to Smallcomb. They include charges of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol and firearm-related charges, he said, including an incident earlier this year where Bassler was arrested for driving under the influence after allegedly running a truck into a middle school tennis court in Fort Bragg.\nBassler was also brought up on federal charges after he allegedly threw packages containing drawings and writings over a fence at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco in four separate 2009 incidents that each brought the city police department”s bomb squad, according to the SF Gate.\nThe county of Mendocino lowered its flags to half-staff in memory and honor of Jesse Pittman, a Willits U.S. Navy SEAL who was killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. The flags will remain at half-staff in Melo”s memory and honor, the Mendocino County Executive Office announced Tuesday. County flags will remain at half-staff until Councilmember Melo”s interment.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T14:46:32Z","url":"https://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/2011/08/31/update-councilmans-memorial-service-sept-10-at-timberwolf-stadium/"}
{"text":"Clarithromycin belongs to the group of medications called macrolide antibiotics. It is used to treat infections caused by certain bacteria. It works by killing or stopping the growth of bacteria that can cause certain infections. Clarithromycin may be prescribed for people with bacterial throat infections, sinus infections, ear infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, and skin infections such as impetigo and cellulitis.\nClarithromycin may also be used to prevent and treat certain infections (mycobacterium avium complex or MAC), associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Clarithromycin can be used in combination with other medications to kill H. pylori, a bacteria known to cause ulcers in the digestive tract.\nEach bright yellow, oval, biconvex, film-coated tablet engraved \"CLA250\" on one side and plain on the other side contains 250 mg of clarithromycin. Nonmedicinal ingredients: crospovidone, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, D&C Yellow No. 10, and sunset yellow.\nEach light yellow, capsule-shaped, biconvex, film-coated tablet engraved \"CLA500\" on one side and plain on the other side contains 500 mg of clarithromycin. Nonmedicinal ingredients: crospovidone, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, and D&C Yellow No. 10.\nAdults: The recommended adult dosing of clarithromycin tablets is 250 mg to 500 mg twice daily (every 12 hours) for 7 to 14 days, depending on the condition being treated.\nThe recommended adult dosing of the extended release form of clarithromycin is 1,000 mg (2 tablets) once daily for 5 to 14 days, depending on the condition being treated.\nFor the treatment and prevention of MAC, the usual dose of clarithromycin is 500 mg twice daily. When used with other medications to kill H. pylori, the usual dose of clarithromycin is 500 mg twice daily for 10 days.\nChildren: The recommended total daily dose for children is 15 mg per kilogram of body weight (to a maximum of 1,000 mg per day). This total daily dose should be divided in 2 equal doses given 12 hours apart. Total treatment duration is usually 5 to 10 days, depending on the condition being treated. For the treatment and prevention of MAC, the usual dose of clarithromycin is 7.5 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily (up to 500 mg twice daily).\nIf the child is receiving an oral suspension of clarithromycin, use an oral syringe to measure each dose of the liquid, as it gives a more accurate measurement than household teaspoons.\nClarithromycin tablets and clarithromycin suspension (given twice daily) may be taken with or without food. Taking this medication with food may cause less stomach upset.\nThe extended release tablets of clarithromycin must be taken with food. The tablets must be swallowed whole and not crushed or broken.\nFinish all of this medication, even if you have started to feel better.\nStore clarithromycin tablets at room temperature, protect them from light and moisture, and keep them out of the reach of children.\nStore clarithromycin oral suspension at room temperature with the bottle tightly closed and protected from light. Do not refrigerate. Any unused oral suspension should be thrown away after 14 days. Rinse the dose measuring oral syringe between uses. Do not store the suspension in the syringe.\nAbnormal heart rhythm: Clarithromycin may cause a heart rhythm problem called QT prolongation. If you have a history of QT prolongation, a medical condition associated with QT prolongation, or are taking certain medications (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.\nAllergy: If you have had some form of allergy to erythromycin or azithromycin, you may be more likely to have an allergic reaction to this medication. If you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction such as a rash, contact your doctor. If you develop hives; difficulty breathing; or swelling of the face, mouth, throat, or tongue, stop taking this medication and get immediate medical attention.\nAntibiotic resistance: Medications such as clarithromycin should only be used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Misuse of overuse of this medication may result in the growth of bacteria that are no longer killed by clarithromycin, particularly in people who are also infected with HIV. Take this medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor.\nDiarrhea: As with other antibiotics, clarithromycin is associated with a serious infection called Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, caused by the bacteria C. difficile. This can occur as late as 2 months after your last dose of this medication.\nIf you have loose, watery bowel movements especially if they are green, foul-smelling, or bloody and accompanied by fever, either during or after taking clarithromycin, get medical attention as soon as possible.\nDizziness, confusion, and disorientation: This medication can cause dizziness, confusion, or disorientation. Do not drive or operate machinery until you are certain that this medication does not affect your ability to perform these tasks safely.\nKidney function: Kidney disease or reduced kidney function may cause this medication to build up in the body, causing side effects. If you have reduced kidney function, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed.\nLiver problems: Liver disease or reduced liver function may cause this medication to build up in the body, causing side effects. If you have reduced liver function, discuss with your doctor how this medication may affect your medical condition, how your medical condition may affect the dosing and effectiveness of this medication, and whether any special monitoring is needed. This medication should not be used by people with severe liver problems.\nIf you develop symptoms of liver problems (e.g., loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, yellowing of the skin or eyes, dark urine, itchy skin, abdominal pain), contact your doctor immediately.\nMyasthenia gravis: This medication can worsen or cause symptoms of myasthenia gravis. If your symptoms worsen or you develop new symptoms such as double vision, drooping eyelids, muscle weakness, or difficulty chewing or swallowing, contact your doctor.\nPregnancy: Clarithromycin should not be used during pregnancy, especially the first 3 months of pregnancy, unless there is no appropriate alternative therapy. If you become pregnant while taking this medication, contact your doctor.\nBreast-feeding: This medication passes into breast milk. If you are a breast-feeding mother and are taking clarithromycin, it may affect your baby. Talk to your doctor about whether you should continue breast-feeding.\nChildren: The safety and effectiveness of using clarithromycin oral suspension have not been established for children younger than 6 months of age. For pneumonia, the use of clarithromycin oral suspension has not been studied for children younger than 3 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of using clarithromycin to prevent MAC infection has not been studied for children under the age of 20 months. The safety and effectiveness of using clarithromycin tablets have not been established for children less than 12 years of age.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T01:56:57Z","url":"https://bodyandhealth.canada.com/drug/getdrug/clarithromycin-by-pro-doc-limitee"}
{"text":"First they bought Skyera, erstwhile all flash array startup. Now WD's HGST unit is buying Amplidata, a scale-out object storage software vendor. Is the world's largest disk drive vendor moving into the storage systems business or not?\nFor those coming in late, HGST is the mashup of Hitachi's former disk business with IBM's former disk business. Western Digital bought HGST a couple of years ago, and is keeping the respected HGST brand alive.\nSkyera was a late-entry into the all-flash array market that HGST bought last year. While it wasn't clear if Skyera had shipped a v1.0 product, the buy was surprising because, traditionally, drive vendors have not competed with their storage system customers.\nBut the reasons for that traditional non-compete stance are fading. All major drive buyers want a 2nd source, but with only 2.5 drive vendors - WD, Seagate and Toshiba - drive buyers can't threaten to walk away.\nHow does Amplidata, a Belgian object storage software company that I've done work for, fit with HGST's plans? Object storage is optimized for large data stores - 500TB and up - where disk drives will be the storage medium of choice.\nHGST has publicly stated their intent to enter the active archive market where Amplidata is a great fit. But how far will they go?\nThe could package up an HGST-branded archive product. They could offer an unbranded version for resellers. Or they could simply offer the software.\nBoth WD and Seagate have enjoyed great success with their branded consumer storage products. It's looking like WD would like to extend their reach into the enterprise with the Skyera and Amplidata acquisitions.\nThe critical issue is how the products get sold to enterprises. HGST has no enterprise sales force and they are expensive to hire.\nI'm betting that they will use resellers and service providers to reach the market. When they make a product announcement we'll see if WD has finally broken the long time taboo against competing with customers.\nComments welcome as always. The storage market keeps getting more interesting.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T03:42:39Z","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/wds-hgst-buys-amplidata/"}
{"text":"An aerial view of the coast near University of Delaware's Hugh R Sharp campus in Lewes.\nNewswise — As more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the global ocean soaks up much of the excess, storing roughly 30 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions coming from human activities.\nIn this sense, the ocean has acted as a buffer to slow down the greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere and, thus, global warming. However, this process also increases the acidity of seawater and can affect the health of marine organisms and the ocean ecosystem.\nNew research by University of Delaware oceanographer Wei-Jun Cai and colleagues at Université Libre de Bruxelles, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, University of Hawaii at Manoa and ETH Zurich, now reveals that the water over the continental shelves is shouldering a larger portion of the load, taking up more and more of this atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nThe study findings, published in Nature Communications on Wednesday, Jan. 31, may have important implications for scientists focused on understanding the global carbon budget.\nUnderstanding how carbon flows between land, air and water is key to predicting how much greenhouse gas emissions the earth, atmosphere and ocean can tolerate over a given time period to keep global warming and climate change at thresholds considered tolerable.\nThe study authors used recently available and historical data from the past 35 years to calculate global trends of carbon dioxide concentration increases in the coastal ocean. The analysis revealed that, while the amount of carbon dioxide in the open ocean is increasing at the same rate as in the atmosphere, these same carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing slower in the coastal ocean.\n\"This is because the coastal ocean is shallower than the open ocean and can quickly transfer sequestered carbon dioxide to the deep ocean; this process creates an additional and effective pathway for the ocean to take up and store anthropogenic carbon dioxide,\" said Cai, the Mary A.S. Lighthipe Professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment.\nThough relatively small in comparison to the open ocean, the coastal zones are where an extremely large amount of the carbon dioxide is exchanged between air and water.\n\"If this conclusion is confirmed by future observations, it would mean that the coastal ocean will become more and more efficient at removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,\" said Goulven Lurallue, the paper's lead author and a researcher with Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.\nUntil recently, these trends were extremely difficult to calculate due to a lack of data about carbon dioxide in coastal waters. Complicating matters further, coastal zones behave differently depending of their location and topography. For example, in higher latitudes such as northern Canada and Greenland, coastal waters usually act as carbon sinks, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In in tropical areas such as the South China Sea, coastal waters are generally considered a source of carbon dioxide.\nAt the same time, human activities have increased the amount of nutrient pollution entering coastal waters from things like fertilizer on land. These nutrients stimulate the growth of algae within the continental shelves, which subsequently removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the researchers said.\nAccording to the research team, this suggests that the continental shelves are becoming a crucial element in the global carbon cycle and for the climate system.\n\"It is important that scientists take into account the contribution of continental shelves to calculate global carbon budgets,\" said Pierre Regnier, professor at Université Libre de Bruxelles. \"The possibility of shelves becoming a more important carbon dioxide sink in the future should be considered in global carbon cycle models and flux assessments.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-21T04:13:07Z","url":"https://www.newswise.com/articles/view/688774/?sc=swhn"}

{"text":"The United Kingdom could still remain a member of the European Union, but only if all other member states agree, said the leader of the second-largest political group in the European Parliament.\n“Our door remains open, if the UK wants to change its mind,” said centre-left MEP, Gianni Pittella, on Tuesday evening (4 April).\nPittella spoke to journalists in Strasbourg at a dinner organised by his group, the centre-left Socialists & Democrats (S&D).\nHe said it was “difficult” to see how the UK could revert its decision to leave the EU, taken last year through an in/out referendum, with prime minister Theresa May at the helm.\n“It's a theoretical possibility, it's an option. All can happen in life,” said the Italian MEP, who noted that the UK's change of heart should come “through a democratic process”.\n“You don't forget. Our position was not for Brexit,” he said.\n“For us it's not a victory that we now we have to start the negotiation. ... It's a reason of sadness, profound, deep sadness. I think this is a loss for Europe and a terrible mistake for the UK,\" commented Pittella.\n“So, our hope is always that they change their mind. But we have to respect the democratic will,” he added.\nHowever, Pittella argued that, in his opinion, there should be unanimity among the remaining 27 member states to take the UK back.\n“It's not up only to the UK to decide if this reversibility can work. It's up also to the European counterpart,” he said.\nPittella's stance on EU-27 unanimity is a political message, there is no legal clarity on how this would work. The legal text that allows the UK to leave the EU, article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, does not explain how a country could decide to remain part of the EU after negotiations for its departure have started.\nPittella's comments came after one of his political allies in Germany, Sigmar Gabriel, said “the burden [of Brexit] for the Brits is higher than for the Europeans”.\nFormer leader of Germany's social-democratic party (SPD) and current German foreign minister, Gabriel rejected May's stance that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.\n“Having no deal is not the best idea for Britain and the European Union,” Gabriel said on Tuesday, after speaking with his UK counterpart Boris Johnson.\n“It would bring a burden on both sides, for the Brits as well as the Europeans,” the top German diplomat added.\n“Of course we want to see negotiations about Brexit being fair. … Fair for Britain, but also from our point of view, fair for the remaining 27 members of the European Union,” he said.\nBoth Gabriel and Pittella stressed that a country outside the EU cannot have the same or more advantages than an EU member.\nPittella spoke to journalists to outline his group's position ahead of a debate in the European Parliament on Wednesday (5 April).\nMEPs will discuss Brexit and adopt a non-binding resolution.\nThe draft text says that the EU-UK deal on the latter's departure should include reassurances of the legal status of EU citizens in the UK, and British citizens living in the EU.\nIt also states that there should be clarity on the settlement of the UK's outstanding financial liabilities and the EU's external border.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T00:09:47Z","url":"https://euobserver.com/brexit/137502"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, I read that popular painkillers can cause irregular heart rhythms. I stopped taking Aleve for pain because I do experience A-fib and atrial flutters. Since going off Aleve, this heart problem has dropped to almost nothing.\nThe trouble is that I switched to aspirin instead. Now I am having big-time bruising with the slightest bump. That convinced me to stop the aspirin.\nI am going to try Tylenol, but I hope my liver enzymes don’t act up. They have been elevated in the past. Is there anything else I can do except stop everything and endure joint pain?\nYou have reason to be cautious with pain relievers. A recent online article in the British journal BMJ (July 4, 2011) suggests that anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac are “associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter.” Such heart-rhythm abnormalities can trigger blood clots that may lead to strokes.\nAlthough aspirin does not appear to trigger arrhythmias, it can thin the blood enough to cause easy bruising. If acetaminophen (Tylenol) raised your liver enzymes in the past, there is a potential risk if you start taking it daily.\nYou may wish to try a home remedy to ease your joint pain. You will find details about dozens of options in our new book from National Geographic (“The People’s Pharmacy Quick and Handy Home Remedies”), online at PeoplesPharmacy.com. Fish oil, turmeric, tart cherries, pineapple or pomegranate juice, gin-soaked golden raisins, plant pectin and purple grape juice as well as herbs like ginger and boswellia may ease your discomfort.\nI read a question in your column about smelly gas, and I have a suggestion: Take a Pepto-Bismol tablet. It helps control that odorous gas.\nPepto-Bismol will turn your stool black, but there’s no harm in occasional use. I take the tablets with me on trips to prevent traveler’s diarrhea.\nPepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) has been shown to control the odor in flatus. It reduces hydrogen sulfide (the smelly stuff) from the colon quite dramatically (Gastroenterology, May 1998).\nRegular use of Pepto-Bismol could be problematic, though. Excessive bismuth can be toxic, leading to symptoms such as nausea, rash, diarrhea, stomach pain, mouth ulcers and kidney damage. Too much salicylate can interact with other medications such as warfarin (Coumadin).\nI have suffered from excessive perspiration since I was a child. I have used countless deodorants, antiperspirants, crystals, baking soda ­— you name it. Nothing worked for very long, not even the prescription formulas.\nI’ve been using MoM (milk of magnesia) for roughly four months, and I will never switch to anything else. I use it on my underarms as well as my groin area, and I swear by it. I use a regular generic formula and have never experienced any issues. On days that I shave my armpits, I skip it just in case I might absorb too much magnesium.\nMilk of magnesia is usually thought of as a laxative to be taken orally, but many people report that it is an effective deodorant when used topically.\nAlthough MoM seems to be gentle, some people develop a skin reaction and should avoid it. We doubt there is much absorption, but loose stools would be a sign of too much magnesium.\nI am surprised and disappointed by your answer to the lady asking for help with her hot flashes. Her doctor took her off hormones because of serious side effects, and she was suffering.\nAlthough the Women’s Health Initiative demonstrated the dangers of PremPro, no comparable studies exist for bioidentical hormones.\nResearchers have long known that the estrogen a woman makes herself has a significant impact on her risk of breast cancer (International Journal of Cancer, Oct. 15, 2010). The longer a woman has active menstrual periods, the higher the risk (International Journal of Epidemiology online, Aug. 13).\nSince bioidentical hormones mimic a woman’s own hormonal production, we cannot assume that this therapy would be entirely safe.

They had already started to blister when I remembered reading about the soy sauce remedy. It was like magic: both the pain and the blisters went away quickly. The next day, I just had two small red marks.\nI’ve been fascinated with this. When my son got his fourth huge mosquito bite of the week, I wondered if soy sauce might help reduce the swelling. His eye had swollen shut from a bite on his forehead, so when he was bitten on the cheek, I applied some soy sauce to it.\nWithin minutes, the swelling had receded, and it was completely invisible before he went to bed. Everyone should have soy sauce packets in his or her first-aid kit!\nThank you for the hint on mosquito bites. We’ve never heard that soy sauce might help.\nMy 92-year-old mom began having excruciating ankle pain about four months ago. She has seen five doctors, including three podiatrists, and a chiropractor, and had an emergency-room visit. They all said her pain was due to osteoarthritis or plantar fasciitis.\nWhile researching ankle pain, I discovered that gout can sometimes affect other joints besides the big toe, and that celery seed extract may be helpful. I bought some for my mother, and after a week or two, she says her ankle pain is gone, although she still has occasional shooting pains into her big toe.\nI feel better having her on celery seed extract rather than the ibuprofen she was taking. We were both worried about the possible side effects of that drug.\nGout can indeed affect other joints besides the big toe, and the pain can be excruciating. Many medications can raise uric-acid levels and increase the likelihood of developing gout.\nDrugs to lower uric-acid levels can help manage gout. Celery seed extract and tart cherries are home remedies for gout, and celery seed has anti-inflammatory effects (Inflammopharmacology, December 2003).","timestamp":"2019-04-22T10:42:59Z","url":"https://www.onlineathens.com/features/2011-09-30-36"}

{"text":"PROFESSOR Peter Higgs of Edinburgh University may now stand as a scientific legend alongside the likes of Newton, Oppenheimer and Einstein.\nBut the Noble laureate-in-waiting is far from the only Scottish scientist behind one of the greatest achievements in physics in the last century: the discovery last week of the elusive Higgs boson – the God particle. Although Higgs proposed the theory of the particle nearly 50 years ago, behind the scenes, dozens of physicists from Scotland played a vital role in the experiments which led to the identification of the Higgs boson – a particle which holds the key to explaining how matter attains its mass, and how the universe works at its most fundamental level.\nThe discovery awaits full endorsement from the scientific community.\nAround 50 academics, researchers, technicians and postgraduate students from both Glasgow and Edinburgh universities were part of the Atlas experiment team at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Cern, Switzerland, which announced the breakthrough on Wednesday.\nHere we talk to some of those Scottish scientists about their work on the Atlas experiment and their thoughts on the significance of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson particle.\nRobson, 32, is a lecturer in physics at Glasgow University and first started working on the Atlas project when he was a student.\nHe analyses data from Atlas – an essential part of proving a discovery is bona fide.\nRobson said finding the new particle was a \"huge milestone\". While the world is celebrating the achievement, scientists are a lot more reserved. The discovery is yet to be fully signed-off in scientific terms, and it is Robson's role to make sure it is.\nHe said: \"We have discovered a new particle, but have really still to show that it is a Higgs boson. First of all the challenge is to collect a lot more of these particles, so we can make really precise measurements and see whether the particle does have the properties that the theory predicts – or whether it is actually something a bit more exotic.\"\nRobson said the \"scientific quest\" had produced huge benefits along the way, including hopefully encouraging more young people into physics. He said: \"Along the way to discovering [the Higgs boson] we have had to overcome all sorts of technological hurdles and that is what has the real effect on everyday life. Whether it is detectors with medical or security applications, or touch screens – which were first made at Cern to control the accelerators – all these 'by-products' do have a huge effect on everyday life.\n\"Students coming in to study physics at university say it's the big science, the particle physics and the astronomy that really excites them. I hope they will see that we are making huge advances in our knowledge in particle physics and it is an exciting time to be doing it.\"\nMartin, 38, is a lecturer in particle physics, involved in experiments at Cern and a former student of Higgs.\nShe co-leads the team in Edinburgh University which has been involved in analysing the data collected in the Atlas experiment to search for signs of the Higgs boson.\nShe said: \"This is a fantastic moment. So many people have worked on it for so long. There is a phrase – we have only seen further because we were standing on the shoulders of giants – and it really feels like that.\"\nAs an undergraduate student Martin was lectured by Higgs and remembers him as being a \"tough, no-nonsense\" but inspirational teacher.\nShe said that to her there were as yet no apparent practical consequences as a result the discovery of the Higgs boson particle but pointed out there had been huge benefits as a result of the building of the experiment.\nShe said: \"For scientists it is really exciting to complete this picture in their head, but on the way to building the LHC and running it and operating it, there has been so many technological spin-offs which the public use nowadays.\n\"The most common one is the world wide web, which everybody uses, but was invented as a tool for physicists at Cern to communicate with each other.\"\nMartin said another recent development was improved solar panels, based on new vacuum technology created to extract air particles in the LHC. She said: \"These have been installed on the roof of Geneva airport and they are much more efficient than the solar panels that had been developed up until then.\"\nDoyle, 49, Cern associate from Glasgow University, is in charge of the publications from the Atlas experiment.\nHe is currently working on submitting the results of the discovery of the Higgs boson to journal Physics Letter B, which will be published at the end of July.\nDoyle said scientists from Glasgow University had been involved in the hunt for the Higgs boson particle for around 20 years, with the current team involving 35 people – a relatively large group.\nHe said: \"Within the collaboration there are 3,000 [researchers] at 175 institutes worldwide, so it is an average number of 15 or so in a team.\n\"Our group is more than double the size of the average group. It is because we have been working on lots of elements and we have led the way in which all the data is analysed and distributed all over the world.\"\nDoyle was at the seminar last Wednesday when the results were announced and said it was unlike any previous scientific event he had attended.\n\"It was like a rock concert, everyone was queuing up,\" he said. \"Not everyone could fit into the auditorium, as there are thousands of people here. So there were different rooms which were being used around Cern to show it.\"\nDoyle likened the process of searching for the Higgs boson to the space mission which was a test run for Apollo 11's successful moon landing.\nHe added: \"My analogy is that last year was like Apollo 10, where we developed the technologies that we required. Now the eagle has landed.\"\nClark, 38, is reader in physics at Edinburgh University, another former student of Higgs and a key scientist on the Atlas project at Cern.\nHe also played a key role in the development of a computer system called Scotgrid, a joint enterprise along with the universities of Glasgow and Durham, which enables vast quantities of data from the experiments to be sent around the world to researchers.\nHe said: \"All the computers around the world are hooked up to the experiment software. We run continually about 120,000 computer programmes across the world to simulate the particles that are produced at the LHC and also to analyse the data.\"\nClark said it was difficult to predict the future potential of the Higgs boson discovery, but pointed out the implications of great scientific breakthroughs in the past had been similarly unknown.\nHe said: \"It just gives us so much more understanding of the fundamental particle interactions, and how they actually come about.\n\"To relate that to everyday life is really quite difficult and it could be very far into the future when we find there is something we haven't thought of.\n\"For example, when the electron was discovered, we didn't think about the whole internet revolution that is completely dependent upon the electron 100 years later.\nOf the Higg's boson's significance he said: \"I think I would liken [this discovery] to finally understanding the DNA mechanism, in that the scientific achievement is of similar scale.\"\nSt Denis, 52, senior lecturer in experimental particle physics at Glasgow University, has been involved in the project since 1991, when he helped to design what would eventually become the Atlas experiment.\nHe said it was difficult to envisage the application of such scientific theories, but pointed out they often had an impact on everyday life.\nHe said: \"Einstein's theory of relativity is one you might have thought was a bit of an esoteric thing – what could that have to do with my life?\n\"The answer is in your cellphone and your satnav. Your position locator will not work without it as if you tried to do the calculations without general relativity it wouldn't find you.\"\nSt Denis said the discovery of the Higgs boson had triggered discussion and excitement equivalent to the first moon landing.\n\"The way to describe this is that it is like the Lord of the Rings – one particle shall rule them all,\" he said.\nHe said the importance of the Higgs boson discovery was comparable to the work of Sir Isaac Newton, who \"made sense out of complete chaos and explained how planets move and at the same time explained how an apple fell. I think that is the level we are at with this.\"\nAlthough the Higgs boson has been nicknamed the \"God particle\", because of its fundamental role in answering questions about the creation of the universe, St Denis said its discovery would not impact on anyone's religious beliefs, adding: \"It strikes me as a term that was invented to be a little devilish.\"\nButtar, 49, is group leader of the Atlas project at Glasgow University and a reader in the university's school of physics and astronomy.\nHe started working on the Atlas project in around 1990, helping to build the experiment and develop a \"tracker\" at the centre of the Atlas detector to collect data and find the particle.\nButtar said the discovery of the particle which appears to be the Higgs boson could be the \"last part of the jigsaw\".\n\"One of the critical things is going to be to start looking at this and to check it is a Higgs,\" he said.\n\"The chances are it is a Higgs, but science has got to be more rigorous than that and we have got to go and do the measurements. That is going to take a while.\" Buttar pointed out that the search for the Higgs boson was not the only purpose of the LHC, which is going to be shut down next year to allow final repairs to be carried out following an accident four years ago.\nA fault caused helium to leak into the tunnel that houses the collider, just nine days after it was switched on in September 2008.\nButtar said: \"We have found the Higgs – that was definitely the main target – and in the next few years we have got to confirm it is the Higgs and what its properties are.\n\"The LHC will shut down next year and they are going to do the final repairs – when it comes back on its energy will have doubled.\n\"That will give us approximately double the reach in terms of looking for new phenomena.\"\nHe added: \"It is a bit like a telescope – the Higgs is one of the big name items we are after, but there are many, many things going on at the same time.\"\nProfessor Peter Higgs, 83, came up with his theory while working as a researcher at Edinburgh University.\nAn honorary Scot, he was born in Newcastle and graduated with a first-class honours degree in physics from King's College London.\nHe moved to Edinburgh in 1960 to lecture in mathematical physics – a city which he had grown to love after once hitch-hiking to the Edinburgh Festival.\nThe scientist hit upon the concept of the Higgs boson while walking in the Cairngorms in 1964 and returned to his lab declaring he had had his \"one big idea\".\nThat moment has led to numerous accolades and he is now in line to win the Nobel prize.\nBut he has spoken of the toll his search to understand the building blocks of the universe has taken, with the stress of his work leading to the breakdown of his marriage to American wife, Jodie, in 1972.\nHe has previously said: \"We split up because I had put my science career above the family. I backed out of a family holiday when we were meant to be going to America. Then I got on a plane and went to a conference.\"\nThe notoriously shy professor retired in 1996 and became emeritus professor of physics at Edinburgh University.\nHe lives in the capital's New Town and doesn't have a television or use a computer – someone else checks his email for him – and rarely answers the phone.\nIn typically unassuming manner, when asked about his reaction to the discovery which is likely to confirm his life's work, his answer was: \"It's very nice to be right sometimes.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-22T02:45:26Z","url":"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13064545.how-scotland-found-the-god-particle/"}
{"text":"Pulitzer Prize-winning author Philip Roth resorts to public channels to get a Wikipedia entry changed...and succeeds.\nAfter writing an open (and, of course, extremely eloquent) letter that was published in the New Yorker, Philip Roth got his wish: Wikipedia has changed its entry on his novel The Human Stain to indicate the proper source for its protagonist Coleman Silk. Rather than listing the late New Yorker critic Anatole Broyard as the inspiration, the entry will now indicate that Princeton professor Melvin Tumin, also deceased, was the one who spoke the key sentences from which the novel grew.\nRoth's original request to Wikipedia was denied, even though he was the author of the work, because the site administrator claimed it needed \"secondary sources.\" Because Wikipedia is an open-source site that, theoretically, anyone can edit, all Roth needed to do was have an assistant (one presumes he has at least one) go in and make the change. However, with enough street cred, which the Pulitzer Prize winner obviously has, not only can you write a letter and get it published in a major magazine and expect results, you can have that same letter referenced in the Wikipedia entry itself.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T22:38:02Z","url":"https://bigthink.com/ideafeed/philip-roths-squeaky-wheel-gets-the-wikipedia-grease"}

From 2016-17 Foley's family was depicted on the WWE Network show, Holy Foley! The show was received favorably but hasn't had any new episodes in nearly two years. Foley joined Andy Malnoske of Wrestling Inc where he discussed the current status of Holy Foley!\n\"We really enjoyed doing it… But it was an expensive show for the [WWE] Network to make, and when you look at some of their other shows, it's a GoPro on a windshield,\" Foley said referring to Ride Along.\n\"I think if this was a show that was on USA or E!, there probably would have been a better home because you could have a big budget for it. It would have found fans who are not WWE loyalists. I think Total Bellas has probably half of their viewership who are not actively watching wrestling.\n\"I was glad they took a chance on it. We really enjoyed those 10 weeks together... and to get paid. But it just didn't work out. It was the highest-rated show [on WWE Network] of all-time for a little while, but there's only so many times people can watch 10 episodes over and over and over.\"\nThe breakout star of Holy Foley! was Mick's daughter, Noelle. There was even some thought that Noelle would join WWE after she expressed interest in becoming a women's Superstar. But she opted against doing that and Foley addressed why Noelle stopped pursuing an in-ring career.\n\"No, she got banged up quite a bit,\" Foley said of Noelle's training. \"Injured, not just banged up but injured.\"\nNoelle may not follow in her father's footsteps by joining WWE, but another Foley kid has already.

Cricket was virtually unknown in Italy at the time, having been outlawed by Benito Mussolini before World War II, as it was considered to be inextricably connected with England.\n“There was always a bit of a crowd stopping to watch us playing,” Archbishop Coleridge said.\nNonetheless, there was one place in Rome where Mussolini could not entirely exert his power: the Vatican.\n“Religious cricket” was still played there and in Catholic seminaries and monasteries by British, Australian and South African members of the Church, says Simone Gambino, president of the Italian Cricket Federation.\nArthur Hinsley, who became Archbishop of Westminster in 1935, is credited with keeping the flame of the game alive. After arriving at the Vatican in 1917 as Rector of the Venerable English College in Rome, he bought land that was adapted as a cricket pitch.\nThe game survived and slowly emerged in post-war Italy, with members of the Church joining local teams, alongside English-speaking expats, and, increasingly, the “new Italians” from Sri Lanka, India and other parts of the subcontinent.\nAnd according to Mr Gambino, Archbishop Coleridge — an opening batsman who also bowled right-arm orthodox spin — was one of the best players in Italy in the 1980s.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T07:04:15Z","url":"http://www.cathnews.com/cathnews/34156-when-the-vatican-went-into-bat-for-italian-cricket"}

{"text":"\"Amid all the noise, we are getting on with the job,\" Prime Minister Theresa May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.\nLondon: Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would not be derailed from leaving the European Union, laying the groundwork for difficult meetings this week in which she will try to unite a divided cabinet behind her vision for post-Brexit Britain.\nMay was applauded by European Union leaders in Brussels on Friday after securing an agreement to move previously-deadlocked talks forward onto the topic of interim and long-term trading arrangements.\nThe progress has gone some way to easing concerns of businesses and investors who fear Britain could crash out of the bloc without an exit deal, or that May's fragile government could collapse under the pressure of delivering Brexit.\n\"Amid all the noise, we are getting on with the job,\" May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. \"My message today is very clear: we will not be derailed from this fundamental duty to deliver the democratic will of the British people.\"\nBut May can expect some difficult exchanges this week when she and senior ministers discuss the so-called \"end state\" of the Brexit negotiations for the first time since Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016.\nThe type of long-term relationship the country should have with the EU is a vexed question at every level in Britain, including within May's cabinet where some want to keep close ties with the EU and others want a more radical divorce from Brussels.\nMindful of the need to keep both sides happy, May has so far plotted a careful path.\nMay says she wants a wide-ranging free trade deal with the EU and a more outward-looking trade policy, but has largely steered clear of the more contentious issues such as whether Britain should stay aligned with EU trading rules and the future role of European courts.\nMeetings expected to take place on Monday and Tuesday are likely to force those issues out into the open.\nOne of the key pro-Brexit voices in the cabinet, foreign minister Boris Johnson, has set out his own view ahead of the meetings, warning May that Britain must avoid becoming subordinate to the EU.\n\"What we need to do is something new and ambitious, which allows zero tariffs and frictionless trade but still gives us that important freedom to decide our own regulatory framework, our own laws and do things in a distinctive way in the future,\" he told the Sunday Times newspaper.\nHe said that mirroring EU laws would leave Britons asking \"'What is the point of what you have achieved?' because we would have gone from a member state to a vassal state.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:38:13Z","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/brexit-will-not-be-derailed-says-uks-theresa-may-ahead-of-crunch-cabinet-meetings-1788907"}

{"text":"The Boy Scouts of America’s blanket ban on gay adult leaders could end Monday when a top policy-making board plans to vote. Church-sponsored Scout units, however, could be allowed to maintain the exclusion.\nNEW YORK – The Boy Scouts of America’s blanket ban on gay adult leaders could end Monday when a top policy-making board plans to vote. Church-sponsored Scout units, however, could be allowed to maintain the exclusion.\nThe new policy, aimed at easing a controversy that has embroiled the Boy Scouts for decades, would take effect immediately if approved by the organization’s 80-member National Executive Board. Its members were convening for a closed-to-the-media meeting conducted by teleconference.\nThe stage was set for Monday’s vote back in May, when the BSA’s president, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, told the Scouts’ annual national meeting that that the long-standing ban on participation by openly gay adults was no longer sustainable. He said the ban was likely to be targeted by lawsuits that the Scouts were apt to lose.\nTwo weeks ago, the new policy was approved unanimously by the BSA’s 17-member National Executive Committee. It would allow local Scout units to select adult leaders without regard to sexual orientation — a stance that several Scout councils have already adopted in defiance of the official national policy.\nIn 2013, after heated internal debate, the BSA decided to allow openly gay youth as scouts, but not gay adults as leaders. Several denominations that sponsor large numbers of Scout units — including the Roman Catholic church, the Mormon church and the Southern Baptist Convention — have been apprehensive about ending the ban on gay adults.\nThe BSA’s top leaders have pledged to defend the right of any church-sponsored units to continue excluding gays as adult volunteers.\nThe BSA faced potential lawsuits in New York and some other states if it continued to enforce its ban. And the exclusionary policy prompted numerous major corporations to suspend charitable donations to the Scouts in recent years.\nLike several other major youth organizations, the Boy Scouts have experienced a membership decline in recent decades.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T18:33:08Z","url":"https://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/2015/07/27/us-boy-scout-leaders-voting-blanket-ban-gay-adults/30756017/"}

Other teams that could be in the market for the outfielders services include the Dodgers, Phillies, Cubs and Angels. Of course the Nationals could also look to re-sign Harper.\nThe Yankees interest in Harper likely has cooled some after trading for Giancarlo Stanton and his $325 million mega contract last season.\nThe asking price for Harper could reach the $400 million dollar mark, though the star’s struggles over the first half of 2018 may bring that dollar amount back down to earth some.\nHarper’s .214 first-half batting average was cause for some concern, but he has since bounced back to hit. .292 on the back nine of the season.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T09:33:01Z","url":"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/ny-sports-bryce-harper-instagram-goodbye-20180927-story.html"}

{"text":"Put it down to weird-word mind glut. I admit to confusion. And if you are like me, Toyota and Nissan have a problem with their blockbuster entries in the luxury-car sweepstakes.\nI have immersed myself in the two cars and still have to think twice before I know that Nissan makes Lexus and Toyota makes Infiniti, or vice versa.\nVice versa wins (I stopped to think), but the befuddlement over names may be the only serious difficulty that Toyota has with its new Lexus.\nSeveral weeks ago I was in love with Infiniti and now my fickle heart has been won by the only serious competition. When you get behind the wheel of a Lexus you can pretty much forget everything else in the luxury class.\nYou can certainly pay more, and you can maybe get a ''better'' car in the BMW 7-series. You can have more oohs and ahhs and fingerprints on the paint with a Rolls or a Bentley Turbo. But nobody else is offering a steal quite like the Toyota Lexus LS 400, which has a base sticker of $35,000 and will cost about $40,000 by the time you get it home.\nYes, that is a lot of money. But these are the days of $20,000 Hondas, $25,000 Fords and $28,000 Oldsmobiles, and the 40 big ones are well spent if you are in the market for an automotive bargain.\nFirst off, there is the technology. The car has an all-aluminum V8 that is so quiet you will try to start it when it is already running. The transmission is a four-speed overdrive automatic that is among the smoothest ever. And then there is Traction Control, which means the rear wheels never spin, despite the engine's oomph.\nTraction Control acts like a limited-slip differential, but better. It uses the car's standard antilock brake system, in tandem with an engine computer that closes a throttle valve to reduce power when wheel spin is imminent.\nThe engine itself is a masterpiece, with four cams and 32 valves. Its 4 liters develop 250 horsepower, a bit less than Nissan's Infiniti, but it moves the 3,759-pound sedan from zero to 60 in about eight seconds, and top speed is rated by the factory at 150 miles an hour.\nEven with that kind of performance though, the sophisticated power plant delivers fuel economy on the order of 17 miles a gallon, city, and 23, highway. Because of the V8's high (10-to-1) compression ratio, you'll have to pull up to the premium pump, and a fill-up will take 22.5 gallons. Given the car's range, the good news is that you won't have to make the visit very often.\nTwo suspension systems are offered, with the option of coil springs or air bladders. The air springs are a version of Toyota's ''FXV-II'' concept-car suspension system, and a change in driving conditions creates an automatic adjustment to minimize roll, dive and squat. The system also compensates for rough roads, reducing bounce and pitch. And it lowers the car at high speeds for better aerodynamics.\nEven without that, the aerodynamics are as good as any in the business. The Lexus has a conservatively beautiful body whose rounded contours produce a coefficent of drag of only .29. And the interior is the exterior's equal.\nToyota has taken bits and pieces from hither and yon, and the car has almost everything. What it doesn't have is the four-wheel steering offered by Infiniti, and if you need to turn on a dime then you ought to buy Nissan. Otherwise, Toyota has it all, from power headrests to a flat emergency key for your newly depleted wallet.\nLeather costs $1,400, and Traction Control will be another $900. A 140-watt Pioneer sound system, which features a six-disk CD changer in the low-liftover trunk, is the basic audio equipment, but you can get a 220-watt Nakamichi system if you really want to one-up the world.\nAnother nice interior feature is the computer that memorizes preferred positions for the driver's seat, the sideview mirrors, the adjustable seat-belt anchor and the wheel, which courteously moves up and out of the way when you remove the ignition key.\nThe leather-wrapped wheel also has power controls to make it tilt and telescope. Maybe the best thing about the wheel, though, is the horn, which is proper and safe. Unlike all the other cars with airbags in the hub of the wheel, there are no tiny and hard-to-find buttons. Toyota has found a way to make the entire hub serve as the button.\nAnd then there is the dashboard, as good looking as any I've seen. The instrument panel uses lighted white needles and white digits behind smoked glass. The analog gauges are complimented by warning lights as usual, but this time the lights are projected onto the smoked glass to catch the driver's attention, a nice piece of technology that imparts a three-dimensional feel.\nAmong the gauges is a 160-m.p.h. speedometer, and Toyota says each car is tested at something more than 100 m.p.h. before it goes into the showroom. The point, the company adds, is that capability at such speeds translates into superb performance in the low and mid-ranges.\nNeither Lexus nor Infiniti has any trouble achieving speeds that will irritate the troopers, but there is a very different feel to the two sedans.\nInfiniti is stiffer, more like Mercedes. Lexus is silkier. But both are super cars and the price is much the same. You just have to remember which is which.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T21:34:12Z","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/sports/about-cars-a-change-of-heart-leads-to-lexus.html"}

{"text":"West Ham manager Slaven Bilic felt a sense of \"relief\" after Diafra Sakho's late goal secured victory over Swansea and eased the pressure on him.\nThe atmosphere at London Stadium had been tense with fans unhappy about the performance of Bilic's side for the majority of the game.\nBut Sakho eased some of the scrutiny on Bilic when he got on the end of fellow substitute Arthur Masuaku's cross in the 90th minute and stabbed the ball home from close range.\n\"It is a relief, a great three points for us,\" Bilic said. \"I know it is shallow when the manager says there is pressure, but that makes a difference.\n\"To keep the support of the crowd we need to keep producing minute after minute and we did not do that in the first half. The guys on the bench lifted the team and crowd.\"\nSwansea were positive with their approach but a long-range effort from Wilfried Bony, parried by Joe Hart, in the first half was the best they had to show for their endeavour.\nHome fans chanted \"sacked in the morning\" at Bilic when his side trailed 3-0 in a 3-2 defeat by Tottenham last weekend.\nFor the most of this contest there was little respite for the Croat as his side laboured against a disciplined and organised Swansea side.\nIndeed there were jeers and boos for Bilic's double substitution when Masuaku and Sakho were introduced for Javier Hernandez and Andre Ayew.\nUltimately, the 49-year-old's decision to throw on both players made the difference, though, as Masuaku's superb run and cross found Sakho's perfectly timed run.\nWith West Ham's next three matches against Burnley, Brighton and Crystal Palace, Bilic will hope the confidence from this victory can spur his side on to greater things.\nSwansea managed just 10 shots on target before this encounter, which head coach Paul Clement blamed on a hectic end to the transfer window.\nTheir play was largely tidy and they used the ball intelligently, with Renato Sanches in particular catching the eye for the visitors.\nHowever, there was a stark lack of cutting edge to Swansea's play. Despite the presence of Tammy Abraham, Jordan Ayew and Bony - for the first half at least - they managed just one shot on target in the entire contest.\n\"A combination of the delivery and the movement need to be better in the final third,\" Clement said. \"We are closer to getting the balance right, but there is still work to be done.\"\nSwansea's first away defeat sent them into the bottom three and, unless Clement gives them more bite in attack, another relegation battle beckons this season.\nThe powerful striker's partnership with Javier Hernandez never really clicked but he was a menace to the Swansea backline. Carroll seems to be getting sharper and his all-round workrate was unrelenting. He was unfortunate not to score when he struck the corner of the goal with an improvised shot.\nThis game produced a total of just 15 shots; only Burnley v Huddersfield on 23 September featured fewer in the top flight this season (13).\nWest Ham have registered three clean sheets in their last four Premier League games, after managing none in the five before that.\nSwansea conceded their first away Premier League goal in 495 minutes of action and suffered their first away defeat of the season.\nFour of the 10 Premier League games where winning goals have been scored in the 90th minute or later in 2017 so far have been against Swansea.\nDiafra Sakho netted his first Premier League goal since November 2016, when he scored against Manchester United.\nSix of West Ham's seven league goals this season have come in the second half, which equates to a league-high 86% proportion.\nWest Ham goalkeeper Joe Hart: \"It was a difficult atmosphere in some ways. I'm never going to criticise the fans, they come here and pay their money and have a right to their opinion.\n\"We have to focus on the win. We have had seven points since the international break [at the beginning of September].\n\"It is on all of us to take the pressure off. We don't get sucked into the speculation, we just stick together and fight hard.\"\nSwansea head coach Paul Clement: \"I think the result was a little harsh in that I don't think that they weren't better than us as such.\n\"We just did not defend that last attack very well. They created a really good scoring chance, which is what we didn't do.\n\"We did not stop the cross coming in, did not defend it in the box and if you concede that late you do not give yourself much chance.\"\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"\"We did not play well in the first half after a good first 10 minutes, making basic mistakes and Swansea were much better on the ball. We have to play better and we can play better.\n\"The changes were crucial with Manuel Lanzini, Arthur Masuaku and Diafra Sakho coming on.\n\"We played a very offensive formation in the first half but lacked the link between the defence and attack and that was why Lanzini made a big impact.\"\nWest Ham face a tricky trip to Burnley on Saturday, 14 October (15:00 BST), while Swansea host newly promoted Huddersfield at the Liberty Stadium at the same time on the same day.\nMatch ends, West Ham United 1, Swansea City 0.\nSecond Half ends, West Ham United 1, Swansea City 0.\nAttempt blocked.

Aid trucks, some guarded by blue-helmeted United Nations peacekeepers, were seen leaving the airport. Water trucks also were spotted in parts of Port-au-Prince.\n\"There's energy in the air,\" said Haitian-born J.B. Diederich, who lives in Miami but returned to Haiti for a few days after the earthquake.\nMore U.N. convoys were seen moving through the city than in previous days, and so could vehicles for large nongovernmental organizations.\nHaitian police seemed to take a more active role, directing traffic and getting out of their vehicles to deal with some problem or other. For several days after the earthquake, heavily armed police officers were often seen speeding by in their trucks but did not seem to stop or do much.\nThere also seemed to be more street vendors Wednesday.\nSome banks and wire-transfer companies plan to open Thursday, as do some stores, Diederich said.\nTo be certain, Port-au-Prince still has a ways to go. But on Wednesday, the city seemed ready to leave the tragedy behind.\nAny U.S. citizen who wants to leave Haiti on a U.S. military transport aircraft can do so simply by going to the airport and applying for voluntary departure at a State Department office placed on the tarmac.\nAbout 5,000 people have left in the past week, an official said.\nThe service is available to U.S. citizens or anyone escorting a U.S. citizen who is a minor. Although the flights are initially free, the U.S. will try to recoup costs from individual passengers.\nThe cargo planes would return to the United States empty if they weren't transporting citizens.\nA handful of Cuban citizens stood in a line next to the U.S. State Department tent at the airport while about 100 U.S. citizens were processed for a flight Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Cubans wanted out, too, but there were no waiting planes. There weren't even any indications that a Cuban plane would arrive at all.\n\"Here everyone resolves their problems, and we don't even have a way to get home,\" said a woman who did not want to give her name.\nNone of the three people interviewed by a CNN reporter would give their names. They laughed nervously when first asked and then said it would be too dangerous for them to comment openly.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T21:28:51Z","url":"http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/20/haiti.notebook/index.html"}

{"text":"A Houston-area mother and son are suing activist Quanell X, alleging he passed himself off as a lawyer and took money for legal services he never delivered.\nThe seeds of the dispute started last year, when Mahalia John paid Quanell - whose real name is Ralph Evans - $2,500 to get her son's criminal record expunged, according to court filings.\nQuanell allegedly told the Johns they could get rid of their existing lawyer and let him take over. But then, the family says, Quanell never delivered.\n\"Mr. Evans wrongfully held himself himself out to be an attorney,\" the suit alleges. \"Mr. Evans provided zero services to Ms. John at anytime, and specifically no services related to the contract and payment for services to him.\"\n\"At no time have I ever told anyone that I am an attorney or that I practice law,\" he said. \"Whenever someone brings me onto a case, on the contract it clearly state in bold that I am not an attorney.\"\nThe lawsuit, filed in Harris County court Monday, is the second such claim against Quanell in as many months. In June, Latorsha and Wiley Smith filed a lawsuit claiming they'd paid $3,500 for legal representation and also received \"zero services.\"\nAttorney Drew Willey is handling both cases, and asking for a $10,000 penalty in addition to at least $100,000 in damages.\nEarlier this year, the People's New Black Panther Party parted ways with Quanell amid ongoing allegations he'd failed to deliver services to families he was paid to represent.\n\"This has been going on for over a decade in the community,\" Yahcanon Ben Yah, the party's national chairman, said at the time. \"He has been in this situation before and what we want to do now is come out and let the people know that we do not condone his actions.

{"text":"Cara Simmons, right, and her sister, Glori Nicholson, react to news that she now owns a Cleveland Heights home.\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cara Simmons has never liked surprises. But surprises in her lifetime never included the keys and title to a freshly renovated house.\n\"I'm going to have to change my mind on surprises,\" she said.\nSimmons, of Cleveland Heights, was the \"victim\" of a \"Prank it Forward\" prank perpetuated by DEFY media. She was sent by her employer, Maid Brite, to help prepare a client for a party and instead ended up tasting a gourmet meal, getting a new wardrobe and, the kicker, the house she was there to clean was actually hers to keep. Fully furnished and decorated.\nNearly 5 million have watched the episode on DEFY's break.com Web site. Simmons has become a media darling, appearing on \"The Queen Latifah Show\" among others.\nBecoming an instant viral sensation came as a bit of a surprise to Simmons, too.\n\"I had no idea what was going on. It was the most amazing prank,\" said Simmons, 36, a Cleveland native and Shaw High School grad.\nHer boss at Maid Brite, Mary Jo Dean, answered a query from a DEFY Media producer looking for a deserving prank \"victim\" in Cleveland. She provided info on all of her employees, asking them for information under the ruse that it was for the company Facebook page. It was narrowed down to three women, all single moms, and the producer recorded video of them, saying it was a company video.\nSimmons' sister, Glori Nicholson, who was also in the video praising her and who was \"pranked\" with a trip with her sister to Mexico, also works at Maid Brite and was one of the finalists. They chose Cara Simmons because of her emotion and her story.\nDean said she didn't know the house was part of the prank until the last minute.\n\"I was in shock and stunned and crying,\" she said. \"I was hoping for a car.\"\nIn the first \"Prank it Forward\" in April, an LA waitress got \"tips\" of cash, a trip, a new job offer and a car.\nThe video of Simmons' big day notes that she had had medical issues. They were severe. Simmons said she suffered from ulcerative colitis, which had gone undiagnosed.\n\"It's extremely painful and I was battling that and there were times when I had to be out of work without any income. I faced eviction a few times,\" she said. \"I'm blessed to have people in my life to pull me through and hold my hand. It was tough. My kids stay with other people because I couldn't get up and get them to school.\"\nHer condition was diagnosed at MetroHealth hospital and she is now taking medication to manage it.\nDEFY agreed with Dean that Simmons was deserving of a prank and partnered with Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater Cleveland to make it happen.\nLou Tisler, executive director of that organization, said it was imperative to find a home in Cleveland Heights, as Simmons' three children – Cierra-Mia, 17, Kiarah, 16 and St. Gavin, 6 – attend Cleveland Heights schools.\nTisler said Ocwen Financial Corporation donated the Cleveland Heights home and property, which had been in foreclosure. DEFY came up with $65,000 for rehab. Simmons will own the home in a land trust deal, meaning the property is owned by NHS but leased to her (99 years, renewable, no fee.) She can deed it over to her children. If she sells the house, the land-trust deal assures the house stays in the hands of low to moderate income buyers, Tisler said.\nSimmons hasn't moved into the home yet. She's still in a rental a few miles away and working to prepare for home ownership.\n\"I'm kind of taking my time and making sure I understand everything,\" she said.\n\"We want to make sure she can actually afford it going forward. To know in Cleveland Heights, with the tax base, what it means to own a home with taxes and maintenance. We're really working with her on a deep level.\"\nSimmons said it's been an education.\n\"They're doing an amazing job preparing me for the things I need to do and not do. They are walking me through it and holding my hand,\" she said.\nSoon, certainly before Christmas, she'll move in and fulfill a dream.\n\"I have never owned a home. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would ever be able to own a home. It was the same chance as walking on the moon, that's how I felt about it,\" she said.\n\"But I have always wanted to own a home and I remember being young and having a home with my family, and my parents got a divorce and it changed and we moved, but I remember the happiness there,\" she said. \"I think my family will just create awesome memories in this house.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-25T10:12:48Z","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/tipoff/2014/11/behind_the_scenes_of_the_prank.html"}
{"text":"Although the recently leaked audio of Hillary Clinton speaking to campaign donors back in February about her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his basement-dwelling millennial supporters is hardly as damning as some have suggested, it does serve as an important reminder of the sharp divisions that surfaced during the Democratic primaries between progressives and Democratic partisans, and why many Sanders supporters remain deeply skeptical of Clinton one month before the presidential election.\nClinton, who admits in one of the soundbites to occupying “the center-left to the center-right” of the political spectrum, comes across as mildly condescending — yet also sympathetic — to Sanders’ millennial base. None of what she says is at all surprising, and most of her commentary is accurate when it comes to understanding why so many millennials supported the democratic socialist.\nClinton, ever the realist, goes on to call Sanders’ entire campaign a “false promise,” and mockingly remarks that she is still trying to figure out what he means by a \"political revolution.\"\nEight months later, many people continue to misconstrue what Sanders meant by calling for a political revolution, and assume — like Clinton — that the senator’s campaign was pie in the sky idealism at best, demagoguery at worst.\nOf course, while Sanders had a historic run, he didn't win the nomination — and many of his younger supporters remain bitter about this fact (especially after it was revealed that the DNC has been pulling for Clinton behind the scenes). Recent polling shows that Clinton continues to be very unpopular with millennials, albeit not quite as unpopular as the Donald, whose blatant xenophobia and sexism are repellent to most people under 30. Millennial voters (18-29) dislike both Clinton and Trump so much that only 41 percent of them say that they are certain to vote in November, according to an ABC/Washington Post poll from last week. The survey also found that under-30 voters prefer Clinton over Trump by only 2 points, compared to a 30-point preference for President Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012.\nSo did the Sanders campaign simply bring about more disillusionment and cynicism among young voters? And was the senator making false promises that he knew he couldn’t keep?\nThis is essentially what Sanders meant by a political revolution, and it’s a message that has long been espoused by those on the left, from socialists and anarchists to unionists and civil rights activists. Put simply, political and social change is in the hands of the people, and no meaningful or radical reform will happen as long as the populace passively accepts the status quo and assumes that revolving-door bureaucrats and billionaire-backed politicians have their interests at heart.\nHillary Clinton takes more of a top-down approach to politics, and gladly stands in the political center (leaning more toward the left or right depending on who she’s talking to). The former secretary of state considers Sanders’ populism naive and unrealistic, and accepts the technocratic method that has dominated the Democratic Party for the past 30 years.\nBut what exactly has modern technocratic liberalism achieved? Some of the Democratic Party’s most important achievements — most notably the Affordable Care Act — are also some of the most jumbled, bureaucratic and corporate-friendly pieces of legislation in modern history (Bill Clinton slipped up a few days ago when he called Obamacare the \"craziest thing in the world,\" which he has since walked back). A fine example of the technocratic liberal is MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, who said in 2014 that \"Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” and that “the stupidity of the American voter” was critical for ACA to pass.\nOf course, this kind of convoluted legislation, watered down by special interest demands and intentionally opaque, is almost inevitable in the current political system. And this is exactly why Sanders was calling for a popular movement to combat the status quo. It is naive to think that revolving-door bureaucrats and politicians desperate for campaign cash would ever agree to radical reform without a popular movement demanding it from below. With this in mind, is it not more accurate to describe Sanders as a realist than a utopian?","timestamp":"2019-04-25T21:52:19Z","url":"https://www.salon.com/2016/10/08/technocratic-for-the-people-what-hillary-clinton-gets-wrong-about-bernie-sanders-political-revolution/"}

It ranges beyond strictly Air Force topics to provide a framework of context for why U.S. service members deployed to the region. Much of the context is not as far removed from the USAF as it might first appear, as any time senior leaders discussed potential U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia throughout the 1950's, nearly all scenarios prominently featured air assets of the USAF and/or carrier-based U.S. Navy (USN) aircraft.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T19:14:20Z","url":"https://www.afhistory.af.mil/"}
{"text":"Millions of American workers in their 50s and 60s want, or need, to keep working past the traditional retirement age of 65 — either part-time or full-time. But after attending Columbia University’s 2017 Age Boom Academy program for journalists, Exploring Inequities in Health, Work and Retirement, I’ve learned how difficult (if not impossible) that can be for many of them.\nBut I also learned from the international Age Boom Academy experts that there are a few things employers, the U.S. government and older workers could do to make staying employed for additional years of our longer lives a more likely reality. The time is right: By 2020, one in four American workers will be over 55.\nBut just imagine the payoffs if the nation made it easier for people who are physically and mentally able to continue working to do so.\nFor those staying in the workforce: better health (cognitive and physical) and finances, more social engagement and higher life satisfaction “Early retirement appears to have a significant negative impact on the cognitive ability of people in their early 60s,” wrote Age Boom Academy speakers Susann Rohwedder, associate director of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging and Robert J. Willis, a University of Michigan economics professor, in a 2010 academic article. And “complete retirement leads to a 23% to 29% increase in difficulties associated with mobility and daily activities,” according to a paper by Ursula Staudinger, founding director of the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center; Age Boom Academy director Ruth Finkelstein and other researchers.\nThe financial payoff — from additional years of salary and, ideally, retirement plan contributions — is obvious, if sometimes overlooked. “We too often frame the conversation about finding purpose in later life, rather than economic survival,” said Finkelstein, who is associate director of the Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center.\nWorking longer, said Axel Börsch-Supan of the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging, also may make you happier. He cited research showing that people who retired early wish they’d retired 1.8 years later, on average. “People regret retiring too early,” he noted.\nFor the U.S. government: more income taxes, Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and a stronger economy The longer people continue working, the more they provide tax revenues and the more they're likely to spend.\n“We have longer lives, so let’s use them,” said Staudinger, a Columbia professor of sociomedical sciences and psychology.\nWhat follows are a few things that would help Americans work longer and delay full-stop retirement, if they want and can, based on research and insights dispensed at Age Boom Academy. In coming weeks, you’ll see more about work, health and retirement from my Next Avenue colleagues Emily Gurnon, Kerry Hannon and Chris Farrell, who also attended the program.\nOnly 5% of U.S. companies offered a formal phased retirement program, according to the 2016 Society for Human Resource Management survey. Phased retirement is one of the 10 “age smart policies and practices” on Finkelstein’s list of them. “Flexibility” is another.\nMake jobs less routine and more interesting for older workers. “Small changes in repetitive jobs can make a big effect in the cognitive health of older workers,” said Staudinger.\n“It’s very important for employers to keep motivation up by giving workers interesting jobs. That makes you more productive as you age,” said Börsch-Supan. “Productivity declines for people with routine jobs, like opening letters.” Let the robots do those tasks; increasingly, they can. In Germany’s auto and insurance industries, Börsch-Supan said, employers intentionally retool their workers to keep them current and enthusiastic.\nMake workspaces more amenable to older workers, especially blue-collar ones. BMW famously spent just $50,000 to overhaul one of its assembly lines in 2007 and make it more older-worker friendly (adding chairs, enlarging computer screen typefaces, that sort of thing). Productivity rose 7% and absenteeism dropped from 7% to 2%.\n“Health and safety protections might make work less odious,” said Finkelstein. Staudinger cited a study where workers in physically strenuous settings were given 20 minutes of daily physical therapy exercises, which resulted in reduced sick days. “The benefit was way more than the investment,” she added.\nBegin an end to the time-honored seniority pay structure. Granted, it would be highly controversial not to pay people more for each year they work at an employer. But it may be time to consider this switch, as has been happening in Japan. Perhaps the way to start would be on a pro-rata basis, with older employees who move from full-time to part-time work at their firms or nonprofits.\nThis change in thinking about pay could help prevent managers from getting rid of otherwise valuable full-time workers in their 50s and 60s merely because they cost more than those in their 20s, 30s and 40s.\nChange the Medicare rules for people working after 65. Under current law, if an employer has 20 or more employees, its group health plan generally pays health benefits for workers 65 and older first and Medicare kicks in for coverage after that. That’s a strong disincentive for employers to retain or hire workers 65 or older. “I’m an expensive employee,” said Willis, 76, noting that the University of Michigan pays for his health insurance.\nPass age discrimination legislation to prevent employers from getting off the hook so easily. As Age Boom participant and ProPublica reporter Peter Gosselin has written zealously lately, a 2009 Supreme Court ruling (Gross v. FBL Financial Services) has made it near impossible to win an age-discrimination case. The Gross decision said an employee who thinks he was a victim of age discrimination must show he wouldn’t have suffered it “but for” his age.\n“Age discrimination remains widespread and difficult to challenge, 50 years after the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,” said Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the City University of New York.\nGonzales and his colleagues have created a Workforce Age Discrimination Scale which determined that age discrimination is significantly related to an increased desire to retire among older workers.\nThink more entrepreneurial. This doesn’t necessarily mean leaving your employer to start a business, although that could be worth considering. It’s more about reassessing what Staudinger calls your “competency profile” and finding the job that best matches it.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T14:51:05Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2017/06/13/what-could-help-americans-work-more-years/"}

{"text":"A look at Fremont9, the newest downtown residential project on Fremont Street and 9th Street, Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2018.\nThe Downtown Project’s quest to revitalize downtown Las Vegas has always been hampered by a lack of available housing.\nFremont9, a five-story mid-rise that offers 232 residential units and 15,000 square feet of retail space in downtown’s East Village District, could help change that. Amid construction and preparations for this weekend’s Life is Beautiful festival, a group of developers on Tuesday morning cut the ribbon on a new luxury apartment tower.\nRent at Fremont9 ranges from $845 per month for a 395-square-foot studio to $3,961 per month for a 1,330-square-foot three-bedroom apartment. Parking is extra, but residents who fully embrace the Fremont9 ethos won’t be driving that much anyway.\nIf it seems unusual to have a music festival going up across the street from a housing complex, that’s a feature not a bug of Fremont9. Every resident receives a free pass to the festival. Located at 901 Fremont Street, on the corner of Fremont Street and 9th Street, Fremont9 is built for residents who want to be surrounded by hip downtown bars and restaurants.\nFremont9 came about as a partnership between the Downtown Project, which owned the land, and real estate investors the Wolff Co., which took the lead on bringing the project to fruition. Construction costs were $43 million to $44 million, said Nate Carlson of the Wolff Co.\nThe roughly 15,000 square feet of retail space is ready and waiting to host those three Cs. On the day of ribbon cutting, expansive floor-to-ceiling windows on the ground floor revealed empty space inside, pure possibility.\n“The space can be devised to accommodate different tenants. Currently, it is open so that they do not limit the tenants they can work with,” says Fremont9 spokesperson Megan Fazio, who notes that leasing is still in the early stages because the opening is so recent.\nA grocery store would be an ideal tenant. Within walking distance, the Market on 611 Fremont Street has downsized its grocery options to make room for Bronze Cafe. The Family Food Mart on 1102 Fremont Street is also within walking distance, but it is no luxury bodega.\nMeanwhile, established local retailers are thrilled about the planned influx of well-heeled residents. Cathy Brooks of Hydrant Club, a dog daycare on 109 N. 9th Street, says she has been eagerly awaiting Fremont9's opening since the groundbreaking. The property allows dogs under a certain weight.\nOne type of retail that won’t be found at Fremont9 is A‌i‌r‌b‌n‌b‌. Just like subleasing, it’s forbidden by property management. This is in contrast with nearby condo tower The Ogden (150 N. Las Vegas Blvd.), which because it is owner-occupied has a variety of units available on A‌i‌r‌b‌n‌b‌.\nIn line with the national trend of builders focusing on the high-end market, which includes the recently opened Lotus LV in Chinatown, Fremont9 offers a host of enviable amenities. There are stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops and built-in blackout shades to match the oversized windows. In addition to a pool and yoga room, the fitness room features a wooden floor reclaimed from a high school gym. Hand-painted murals add an artsy allure to common areas. The Wolff Co.’s Nate Carlson says that the edgy vibe was carefully curated to foster a sense of creativity that aligns with downtown.\nAdditional amenities include common rooms with a video wall, a music wall, billiards and a TopBrewer brand app-powered espresso machine. There’s an “entertainment kitchen” and “community dining space.” Interior courtyards have bocce ball, ping pong and barbecue grills. Bicycle storage and 24/7 on-demand parcel lockers complete the urban lifestyle.\nSo much luxury does not come cheap, and the central downtown location comes at an extra price. Luxury apartments elsewhere in the valley are significantly less expensive. A 1,440-sqare-foot unit at Elysian at The District rents for $2,522 per month, which is nearly $1,500 less than a comparable unit at Fremont9. Apartments at The Well in Henderson’s Union Village, which are also owned by The Wolff Group, range from $1,051 for 465 square feet to $1,977 for 1,201 square feet.\nUrban living giveth and taketh away. The advantage of living downtown comes in the form of walkability. The disadvantage of high-density living is the loss of free parking. A parking space at Fremont9 will set residents back another $100-$250 per month, depending on whether they choose a garage or carport. Residents who prefer a more budget option are encouraged to rent a space from the nearby municipal “Llama Lot.” Or they can always try their luck finding a free space on the street.\nPotential residents have not been deterred. Carlson says that in 30 days of being open, the property has become about 37 to 38 percent occupied.\nDowntown Project executive vice president of operations Michael Downs is most proud of the location of Fremont9 and how the property is helping transform the area. In addition to new construction, Downs says that the Downtown Project is working to capitalize on demand for housing by renovating properties they already own.\nAbout a block away from Fremont9 is the 10-unit Nolana, which Downs said became 100 percent occupied within a month of going on the market. DTP is also working on renovations of Fergusons and the Downtowner, which will become mixed-use spaces. The newly renovated Cassia, an 18-unit apartment complex on 9th street and Bridger, will open next week.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T17:03:47Z","url":"https://vegasinc.lasvegassun.com/business/2018/sep/19/fremont9-luxury-apartments-splash-downtown-vegas/"}

Reg reader Stuart McConnachie, who also forwarded the binhex theory, guesses the identical overcharge is the result of a rounding error.

{"text":"HELENA, Mont. — U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte is pinning his third campaign in two years on Montana residents being better off economically since President Donald Trump took office and that the voters will give him some of the credit.\nGianforte has tied his political fortunes to Trump as he seeks his first full term in Montana's only House seat. He won a special election last year to serve the remainder of Ryan Zinke's term after Zinke resigned to become Interior Department secretary.\nGianforte has had to fend off renewed criticism over his assault on Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs the day before that special election. His Democratic opponent, Kathleen Williams, has made it a campaign issue, and Trump praised him for it during a recent rally.\nThe entrepreneur-turned-politician initially gave a tepid endorsement of the president during a failed campaign for governor in the same 2016 Montana election that Trump won in a landslide, then found himself on the winning side in the 2017 special election when he became a full-throated Trump supporter.\n\"Thank God Donald Trump is our president,\" Gianforte said to cheers during a recent rally in East Helena. \"You know why we're doing this. In America, we've always believed that if you work hard, follow the rules and persevere, you can make a better life for yourself. That's the American dream. \"\nGianforte has centered his campaign on emphasizing his 16 months in office and telling voters that he's working hand in hand with the president.\nHe's cited his trips on Air Force One and visits to the Oval Office. His speeches are peppered with \"we\" and \"us\" when he talks about the economy, as in, \"We've gotten the economy going,\" and \"We now have more jobs open in the country than people looking for work,\" as he said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.\nWilliams, a former state lawmaker and water specialist for state government and a nonprofit organization, said she doesn't believe Gianforte's time in office gives him an advantage.\n\"He's hiding behind his incumbency. Well — he's barely an incumbent,\" she told the AP. \"He hasn't done that much. So, I don't think it's a disadvantage at all.\"\nWilliams was the only woman running in a crowded Democratic primary in June, beating out two better-funded men in a year that has seen a record number of women running for office.\nShe is seeking to become the first Democrat to hold the House seat since Pat Williams left in 1997. She also would be the first woman to hold the office since Jeannette Rankin left in 1943.\nLibertarian Elinor Swanson is also on the ballot.\nWilliams, 57, has centered her campaign on the themes of improving health care and access to it, along with protecting the environment and Montana's outdoor heritage. In a dig at Trump and Gianforte, she also says restoring civility and integrity to Congress and restoring America's place in the world are among her top priorities.\nGianforte, 57, is a technology entrepreneur who turned to politics after selling his software company, RightNow Technologies, to Oracle for $1.8 billion in 2011. He says his top issues are undoing Obama-era regulations in a bid to promote economic growth, improving community safety by addressing the methamphetamine crisis, protecting gun rights and increasing access to public lands.\nWilliams has steadily been attacking Gianforte's record. In October, she stepped up those attacks to include the assault against Jacobs last year.\nGianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for throwing the reporter to the ground when he tried to ask the candidate a question.\nWilliams released an ad with audio of the assault taken from Jacobs' recorder on the same day that Trump praised Gianforte for the attack, thrusting it back into the spotlight in the final weeks of the campaign.\nIt received additional attention when Jacobs' lawyer sent Gianforte's lawyer a letter accusing the congressman of lying about the attack and mischaracterizing the terms of a settlement.\nGianforte also ratcheted up his political attacks. His campaign has sent out daily statements that call Williams \"extreme\" on various issues and released an ad tying her to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, whom Williams said she wouldn't support if elected.\nGianforte says Williams has misrepresented his record, especially when accusing him of not meeting with constituents. He cites telephone conferences with them and regular radio appearances as examples of his accessibility.\n\"I think it's a false narrative being promoted by my opponent to try and create a wedge, and frankly, it's not true,\" he said.\nWilliams said Gianforte has distorted her positions, falsely saying she opposes gun rights, and that Montana voters will be able to see through him.\n\"Apparently, he's desperate for power,\" Williams said of the new attacks. \"Montanans value truth and integrity and honesty. It's not happening in his campaign.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-24T13:16:24Z","url":"http://www.startribune.com/gianforte-s-fortunes-tied-to-trump-in-montana-house-race/499563881/"}
{"text":"Originally Published: August 13, 2015 8:02 p.m.\nA few months ago, a customer asked if we had a book called \"Six Who Came To Serve,\" which he said was about several people who came here to serve the Prescott community, but he did not know who had written it. Then another customer asked about the book. I couldn't find such a book through our normal distributors, but continued to pursue the search since not much has been written about that side of Prescott's history. I finally located the author, Prescott Daily Courier columnist Tom Cantlon, who was able to provide the books and to come to the store to talk about it and about his other book of columns, \"Early Essays.\"\nThe six, Kathleen Murphy, Brad Newman, Max Bell, Gordon Glau, Don Ostendorf, and John Allen, all began work in the Prescott organizations they were to grow and direct for 30 years in the early 1960s. Cantlon weaves each of their stories together, beginning with their early histories and the effect that had in shaping their passionate desires to help the people in the Prescott community. Then he has each of them tell their stories, recounting just what they were able to accomplish and how they went about doing it.\nAccording to Cantlon, for Brad Newman, putting his exceptional employees into immediate and practical work contributed greatly to success. John Allen, too, found success in putting his staff into immediate practical action, even if it entailed moving into a new building without heat in late November to get the job done. \"Today you can't do that,\" Allen said.\nFor Kathleen Murphy, among other things, it took pluck, as when she gift-wrapped her dress as a consolation prize for a sexist high-up she had triumphed over.\nWorking well with other local agencies and innovation were other methods that brought success mentioned by Murphy as well as by Don Ostendorf, Greg Glau and Max Bell.\nThis review only touches on a few of the things it took for these six dedicated people to have such a profound impact on the Prescott community.

{"text":"Like the miniskirts and long hair that raised eyebrows in an earlier era, body piercing has emerged as a '90s symbol of teenage rebellion. Pierced cheeks, eyebrows, tongues, navels, and unmentionables are popping up on teenagers across the nation, and the trend shows no signs of ebbing anytime soon.\nParents have complained to lawmakers that they have no say in their fashion-conscious teenagers' decisions to get pierced. Others worry about health risks of piercing--most commonly, treatable skin infections, but also the remote possibility of contracting infectious diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS from unsterilized piercing instruments.\nSpurred by these concerns, state legislatures are reining in the trend. More than half of the nation's states have provisions on the books regulating the body-piercing industry, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Oregon, for example, require parental consent for minors seeking to get pierced. Several other states are debating the issue.\n\"This year was the year for body piercing and tattooing,\" said Lisa Speissegger, who covers health policy for the NCSL. As the trend spreads, she said, \"I expect most legislatures will have looked into this.\"\nAlthough it is under fire for allegedly misusing state money, the Lawrence, Mass., school district will have its entire $80 million budget for the 1997-1998 school year paid for by the state.\nThe payment arrangement is the result of the state's 1993 Education Reform Act, which gave a boost in state aid to poorer districts. Lawrence, the only district to be fully funded by the state, is Massachusetts' poorest.\nBut Education Commissioner Robert V. Antonucci has warned the district to watch its spending, or risk losing its underwriter.\nReports of the 11,650-student district's questionable spending surfaced last fall, and included revelations that reform dollars were being used for $3,000 laptop computers, cut flowers, and bagpipe lessons even as Lawrence High School was being stripped of its accreditation.\nIn February, Gov. William F. Weld appointed an audit board to investigate how Lawrence and the Bay State's 371 other districts are spending the $1.3 billion each year in additional aid made available by the 1993 law. The state auditor will release a report on school spending later this month.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T11:23:15Z","url":"https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1997/05/14/33stjour.h16.html"}
{"text":"The latest lawsuit to target the proposed Clippers arena in Inglewood alleges two city-linked boards violated state laws governing open meetings and the environmental impact of construction projects in June when they approved disposing of land connected to the plan.\nIn a complaint filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the group Inglewood Residents Against Takings and Evictions asked for an injunction preventing the land’s transfer until the boards comply with the Brown Act and California’s Environmental Quality Act.\n“The failure to adequately inform the public is consistent with and further evidence of the City of Inglewood’s deliberate attempts to obfuscate the true nature of actions taken to further the Clippers Arena Project,” the 27-page complaint said.\nAt least four other lawsuits related to the arena have been filed since the privately-financed project became public in June 2017. One of those lawsuits, also filed by the Hermosa Beach law firm Chatten-Brown & Carstens representing Inglewood Residents Against Takings and Evictions, is scheduled for a hearing in December.\nThe complaint last week accused the Successor Agency to the Inglewood Redevelopment Agency (composed of Butts and Inglewood’s four other City Council members) and the Oversight Board to the Successor Agency to the Inglewood Redevelopment Agency (on which Butts serves) of not informing the public that the disposition of 13 parcels of land was connected to the arena.\nNeither meeting notice, required to be issued 72 hours before the gathering, noted the connection between the agenda items and the arena.\n“The Oversight Board failed to inform the public that the properties are proposed to be disposed of pursuant to an agreement with extensive potential impacts on thousands of Inglewood residents and businesses,” the complaint said, adding that residents “could not have reasonably understood the nature of the action or the implications of the same” from the agenda language.\nMost of the 13 parcels at issue, all vacant, are located along West Century Boulevard between South Prairie Avenue and South Yukon Avenue. Stan Kroenke’s 298-acre sports and entertainment complex that includes a stadium for the Rams and Chargers is under construction across the street.\nThe arena project is currently in an environmental review process that is expected to take 18 months. Eighty-four percent of the 23 acres that would include the arena, as well as a training facility, team offices, hotel and more, is owned by Inglewood or the two agencies.\nThough the Clippers signed an exclusive negotiating agreement with Inglewood last year to explore building the arena, the team’s lease to play at Staples Center runs through 2024.\nDevelopers are expected to release the first renderings for the arena this fall.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T19:01:08Z","url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-clippers-arena-lawsuit-20180813-story.html"}

{"text":"Showing no signs of dilution in the rules governing the controversial National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC), Union Home Minister P Chidambaram on Friday wrote to chief ministers (CMs) of 10 states to keep the issue above party politics.\nChidambaram in his letter to the CMs said that power to arrest and search was “bare minimum” essential for the anti-terror organisation. This provision has come under strong criticism from the non-Congress ruled states on the ground that it would infringe on the state’s rights.\nChidambaram, who has written identical letters to the CMs opposing this clause, said he has asked Home Secretary R K Singh to convene a meeting of state police chiefs and heads of anti-terror agencies.\nChidambaram, however, rejected the charge that NCTC infringed on the rights of the states and said the agency derives its powers from the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 that was amended in 2008. “When the Bill was introduced in December 2008 to amend the Act, it was passed by both houses of Parliament. There was no demur or opposition,” he said in the letter.\nChief ministers of Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and West Bengal had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh charging that certain provisions of NCTC had trampled on the powers of the states.\nSingh wrote back to them on Thursday saying he has asked the home minister to address their concerns. Chidambaram’s letter comes a day after the PM wrote to the agitated CMs.\n“The powers conferred under Section 43(A) of the Act must be read with the duty under Section 43 (B) to produce the person or article without unnecessary delay before the nearest police station (which will be under the state government), and the SHO of the police station will take further action in accordance with the provisions of the CrPC,” he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T17:09:17Z","url":"https://www.deccanherald.com/content/229756/keep-nctc-above-party-politics.html"}

{"text":"The Financial Post’s Geoff Zochodne did a sweep of the big banks’ economists on Oct. 1 and found that the received wisdom now is that the Bank of Canada will quicken its march to a more normal policy setting.\nBank of Montreal promptly added an extra quarter-point lift to his outlook for 2019, predicting a benchmark rate of 2.5 per cent within the next 12 months or so, a full percentage point higher than the current setting. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assumes the Bank of Canada will go ahead with an increase later this month and then follow that move with another one in January, earlier than its previous forecast. Derek Burleton of Toronto-Dominion Bank also said a hike on Oct. 24 was “virtually cemented” and that the smart money now is on three additional increases next year, rather than two.\nThe reason the professional forecasters pivoted so quickly was because logic was on their side. The central bank had identified trade uncertainty as a drag on business investment. With that anchor removed, Canada’s economy should be able to push through other headwinds with more vigour. Faster growth would spark faster inflation, leaving Canada’s central bank with little choice but to raise interest rates to constrain prices.\n“We continue to expect the Bank of Canada to resume monetary policy tightening on Oct. 24 in a context where it is hard to justify keeping interest rates below inflation now that uncertainty surrounding U.S.-Canada trade has dissipated,” Matthieu Arseneau of National Bank Financial said on Oct. 5 after Statistics Canada’s latest hiring survey showed the unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 per cent in September, one of the lowest levels on record.\nAll that makes sense. Still, let’s pump the brakes a little. It’s too soon to predict with so much certainty that the new NAFTA will alter Canada’s interest-rate path. It’s possible Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump hasn’t changed much of anything.\nWhat was the surprise on Oct. 1? The introduction of a statute that would give Washington influence over Canada’s dealings with China came out of nowhere, that’s for sure. But most, including Stephen Poloz, the Bank of Canada governor, assumed the talks themselves would get sorted.\nBefore this week, the prevailing assumption was that failure to resolve NAFTA by the Sept. 30 deadline set by the Trump administration would have forced Poloz and his deputies to leave the benchmark rate unchanged on Oct. 24, like they did at the previous policy meeting in September.\nActually, that would have depended on market reaction and feedback from the central bank’s contacts in the real economy. Policymakers have stated explicitly that they intend to raise interest rates gradually, and the data since its pause on Sept. 5 have been fairly strong. The Bank of Canada estimates that a “normal” benchmark interest rate — one that neither encourages borrowing nor impedes it — is between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. That’s still a long way from where the benchmark rate is now, so policymakers might have been prepared to raise rates even if negotiations had collapsed.\nThe NAFTA talks were noise, not signal; the signal will be in indicators of business investment, and we don’t have those yet. The first good look will come when the Bank of Canada releases its next Business Outlook Survey, on Dec. 21. Policymakers put a lot of weight on that report, but it only reveals intentions. Poloz will want to see evidence of actual spending, too, and that will require patience. Consider: David Bensadoun, chief executive of ALDO Group Inc., told me in an interview last month that it would take six to nine months for him to simply shift from one supplier in Asia to another. It will be well into 2019 before the central bank decides if it can stop worrying about business investment.\nUnlike most of their counterparts on Bay Street, the economists at RBC Capital Markets were unmoved by the week’s big trade story. Non-energy exports have been slow to catch fire despite a couple of years of strong global demand. Uncertainty is part of the problem, but a bigger one probably is that Canada has been muscled out of its traditional export markets by more aggressive competitors, according to RBC.\nA new free-trade agreement that looks a lot like the old free-trade agreement won’t fix Canada’s competitiveness issues. One of the reasons the Bank of Canada has promised to raise interest rates gradually is because the country’s exporters need a crutch. That didn’t change overnight on Sept. 30.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T15:20:04Z","url":"https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/time-to-pump-the-brakes-on-post-usmca-rate-hike-consensus"}
{"text":"Cyrus Vance Jr. during the inaugural National Prosecutorial Summit, October 21, 2014.\nFor most of his eight years as Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr. has kept a low enough profile that politicos pause a second at the mention of his name, remembering that he isn’t his father, the Washington wise man who served as Jimmy Carter’s secretary of state. Junior’s biggest initiative has been effective but characteristically wonkish: applying data analysis to crime-fighting.\nCy Jr.’s name recognition certainly has skyrocketed in the past two weeks. He’s under fire as never before, accused of bad judgment and dubious ethics. First came news that he’d dropped a 2012 criminal investigation of Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. over their misleading statements to prospective condo buyers—after a conversation with Trump family lawyer Marc Kasowitz, one of the largest donors to Vance’s political campaigns (Vance has said that Kasowitz and the contributions “had no influence whatsoever on my decision-making in the case”). Then The New Yorker, as part of a devastating story by Ronan Farrow, released two minutes of audio, recorded in 2015 by the New York Police Department, in which Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, now accused by more than two dozen women of sexual harassment and assault, essentially admits to groping a 22-year-old Filipina-Italian model and actress, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.\nA spokeswoman for Vance said the Strauss-Kahn episode did not affect the office’s subsequent pursuit of sexual-assault cases “in the slightest,” and pointed to other high-profile defendants who have been successfully prosecuted, for similar offenses, by the district attorney. Yet with Weinstein’s piggishness finally exposed, Vance is enduring the harshest glare of his low-key tenure, with his competence and ethics questioned. Not that he’s in danger of losing his job anytime soon: he ran unopposed in New York’s Democratic primary in September, and next month, in the general election, Cyrus Vance Jr. will face only a long-shot write-in opponent.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T10:50:05Z","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/could-cy-vance-have-prosecuted-harvey-weinstein-for-sexual-assault"}

{"text":"School Shooters Are Rarely Female. What Does That Mean for Schools?\nPolice arrested a 12-year-old girl suspected of shooting two students in the classroom of Salvador Castro Middle School in Los Angeles Thursday morning. Later that evening, they said they believed the shooting was unintentional and that the student had been booked on charges of negligent discharge of a firearm, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nBut before police shared details of the shooting or the suspect's motive, her gender stood out in news reports.\nSchool shooting suspects are almost always male. Why is that? And what does it mean for school safety?\nFor much of the day Thursday, the incident seemed like a typical school shooting, apart from the gender and young age of the suspected shooter.\nA 15-year-old boy was in critical but stable condition with a gunshot wound to the head, and a 15-year-old girl was in fair condition after she was shot in the wrist, police said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. Three others, an adult and two students, suffered more minor abrasion injuries, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nPolice later said they believed the girl discharged the semiautomatic handgun unintentionally.\n\"​​​Someone decided to bring a gun, I guess someone was accidentally playing around with it,\" a student told the Times. \"They thought it was a fake gun.\"\nPolice arrested the suspect and evacuated students from the school before launching an investigation. Officials had not named the suspect by Thursday evening.\nWhile it is rare, there have also been female suspects in intentional school shootings.\nThere's a common misconception that school attackers are all young, white, socially isolated men who play too many violent video games. But school safety experts have said that profile is far too narrow and that schools need to be responsive to the safety concerns and social and emotional needs presented by all students to create a safe environment.\nBut it is striking that most school shootings, and most mass shootings in general, are perpetrated by male suspects. An Education Week analysis of news reports found four incidents where at least one person was injured as the result of a shooting at a K-12 school or school-related event in 2018. Of those incidents, only the Los Angeles shooting involved a female suspect. The trend is even starker looking back through years of data collected by other organizations; only a handful of identified suspects are women or girls.\n\"Most violent crime is perpetrated by males,\" said Peter Langman, a psychologist who studies school shootings and has authored several books about them. \"The fact that school shooters are typically male is part of the overall phenomenon of violence being a predominantly male phenomenon.\"\nIn the case of \"rampage shootings,\" perpetrators often have a sense of \"damaged masculinity,\" which Langman defines as a sense of failure or inadequacy in parts of their life that they have linked to male identity, like sexuality or physical strength, he said.\nSome bullying researchers have also said concerns about heterosexual, masculine gender norms can feed bullying problems among male students. They've urged schools to adopt bullying policies that prohibit harassment on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\"There is actually no stereotype,\" Dewey Cornell, the director of the Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia said in 2014. \"There is a human tendency to look for predictive factors, but if we apply those to the general population, we will find many false positives.\"\n\"A 2002 report by the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center, prepared after the agency analyzed 37 school attacks that occurred between 1974 and 2000, concluded that \"there is no accurate or useful 'profile' of students who engaged in targeted school violence.\"\nActs of school violence have been carried out by attackers of all races, ages, disciplinary histories, and family backgrounds. And, though perpetrators are typically male, women have also played roles in mass attacks, experts on such incidents say.\nIn the events analyzed, attackers fell all along the social spectrum, from popular students to \"loners,\" the Secret Service report said.\nWhile the agency didn't find common demographic threads, it did note some psychological trends among attackers: Many \"felt bullied, persecuted, or injured by others prior to the attack,\" many had a history of suicide attempts or feelings of depression or desperation, and most had no history of criminal behavior.\nAnd, in 31 of the 37 events studied by the Secret Service, shooters told at least one person about their plans beforehand, the report said. Threat-assessment experts say that such \"leakage\" is common, and that attackers often leave more subtle clues that they are distressed, even if they don't explicitly detail their plans in conversations.\"\nSo, while most shooters are male, schools should seek to be aware of the needs of all students, working to create a supportive environment and reduce social isolation, safety experts said. That's because school shooters don't usually \"just snap,\" and often hint at their plans in advance. Addressing school climate concerns is important for the educational success of all students, even if they don't have a violent intent, researchers say.\nPolice provided very few details about the circumstances behind the Los Angeles shooting Thursday, and they did not say if the school had any previous concerns about the student they arrested, how she obtained the weapon, or how she came to fire it in school.\nCornell has worked to develop a threat-assessment model that schools can use to respond to such concerns. Education Week's Lisa Stark recently interviewed Cornell for this piece she did for the PBS Newshour about preventing school violence.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T16:44:10Z","url":"https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rulesforengagement/2018/02/school_shooters_are_rarely_female_what_does_that_mean_for_schools.html"}

With nods to seasonal favorites (hello, Mr. Nutmeg), festive twists on old classics and quirky concoctions sure make you host(ess) of the year, you can’t go wrong with this compilation of “spirited” drinks.\nCranberries are a staple of the holiday season. In fact, according to Michigan State University, it’s likely the tart red fruit graced the first Thanksgiving table (but likely not in the jellied form often enjoyed today). Don’t stand by while those cranberries play second fiddle to turkey all season long. This festive martini from Cheers to the Host combines smooth Gentleman Jack with tart cranberry juice, then tops it all off with a splash of sweet ginger ale for a martini that’s anything but dirty.\nWith the pressure of hosting the perfect holiday soiree, you’ve got more to worry about than your beverage cart (although, to be honest, that’s likely what’s most important to your guests). This simple cocktail is easy on the grocery list and puts a sweet spotlight on a seasonal standard: ginger. Combine Gentleman Jack with either ginger ale or ginger beer (there’s a difference, as explained in the recipe), then top with a squeeze of fresh lime. It’s a crowd pleaser you’ll never have to sweat over.\nIt may be the season’s most divisive flavor, but those who love eggnog really love eggnog. But the same old cocktail year after year can get tired, so put a twist on (but not a twist in, because, gross) your eggnog this year by spiking it with something unexpected. This version from All Recipes adds whiskey to the traditional rum for an unexpected delight. Sprinkle with a little nutmeg and you’ll be sure to thrill your guests — well, the ones who like eggnog, anyway.\nIt’s the holiday season, so you can do things you usually don’t — like opt for an espresso cocktail rather than the same old espresso after dinner (or lunch, no judgment here). This luscious cocktail from Drink Me embraces everyone’s favorite vices: coffee, cream, vanilla and really good whiskey. Combine Gentleman Jack with vanilla sugar syrup, espresso and coffee cream liqueur for a good shake. Dust with chocolate shavings if your celebration calls for a little (more) indulgence.\nThe weather outside is frightful, so a hot cocktail is more than delightful — it’s practically required. Redbook calls this recipe one of the coziest cocktails for cold weekends. Bonus: It’s easy to make, with no shaker required! Combining whiskey, vermouth, taverna and maple syrup with hot water, this drink certainly goes down smooth. Stand by tradition and serve this in a canning jar, or get cozy with your favorite holiday mug. And feel free to make a little extra — there’s a long winter ahead.\nIf apples, oranges, cloves and cinnamon sticks don’t say “I’m never venturing out into the snow ever again,” then what does? These flavors will make you want to stay in all evening — especially if you opt for the warm version. This recipe from Mollie Stone’s Markets mixes the coziest flavors of the year — cinnamon, cloves and apple cider — with Gentleman Jack for a festive drink you can serve warm or cold. Just simmer the ingredients together and you’re ready to drink and be merry (the “eat” part is optional).","timestamp":"2019-04-18T15:46:16Z","url":"https://ktar.com/story/2310556/top-holiday-drink-recipes/"}

That was the largest single donation in the school’s history.\n“I would not be here if it were not for my time at RIT,\" said McChord at the time. \"This is where I first had the idea of starting my company.\"\nMcCord hopes he will have more time now to build relationships with RIT staff and students, and help facilitate future business success stories out of the university, he said Tuesday.\nDatto, was the region’s first START-UP NY company when it opened in downtown Rochester four years ago. The company recently unveiled a new space in The Metropolitan, complete with a slide and sleeping pods.\n\"I continue to be an enormous advocate in Rochester....and of course Datto continues to hire and grow in Rochester as well,\" he said. The space has the capacity for 350 to 400 employees, and there are about 120 positions open in Rochester right now, said McChord.\nWeller echoed that sentiment, saying that Rochester has been a \"phenomenal location for us.\"\n\"It's part of the fabric,\" Weller said.\nIncludes reporting from Sean Lahman and Meaghan McDermott.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T19:07:08Z","url":"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2018/10/23/austin-mcchord-datto-ceo-step-down-datto-ceo-role/1740958002/"}
{"text":"We are somewhere in the jungle, deep in the heart of the cinematic and moral darkness that the movie industry has made of Vietnam. We are in the land of \"Rambo: First Blood II\" (citywide). Ominous Jerry Goldsmith music throbs. The air reeks with sweat and tangled foliage. A squad of Soviets is searching for one man, one walking hunk of slaughter and vengeance: John Rambo--beside whom Superman is a wimp and James Bond a Piccadilly hairdresser.\nTheir tread is soft, their faces wary. Rambo, armed with nothing but a knife, and bow and arrow, has already wasted at least a hundred of their best. He is obviously no one to be trifled with.\nOne of the soldiers pauses by an embankment of pure mud. Suddenly, the mud stirs. The mud breathes. The mud glares angrily at the marauding Soviet. The mud reaches out with one tawny mud-arm, throttles the invader and sends a hunting knife deep into his chest. Blood and mud commingle, and at last we see: This is no ordinary mudbank, this is the indefatigable Rambo, in another of his multitudinous (if muddy) disguises--Rambo the mud-man, battalion of one.\nThe absurdity of this sequence should alert you to the movie surrounding it. \"Rambo\" is an inane sequel to a fairly good melodrama; another example of an attempt to repeat an earlier success that goes wildly out of scale.\nIn \"First Blood,\" Sylvester Stallone's Rambo was a disconsolate Vietnam vet who, pushed too far in a small Northwestern town, battled to the death with its police, and nearly won.\nSomehow--perhaps because of Stallone's taciturn charisma, perhaps care in the direction, perhaps sheer speed--this incredible tale was made plausible. But nothing on earth, not even narration by Walter Cronkite, could perform that miracle here.\nNow, Rambo is not battling a mere town, a mere police force, a mere highway patrol. Now he is battling the combined Soviet and Vietnamese armies--and his own Washington superiors as well. And, from Stallone's glower when he asks Green Beret commander Richard Crenna, \"Are they gonna let us win this time?\" we see that only \"they\" could stop him. Hand this man a switchblade and he could carve off the U.S.S.R. with one stroke and hurl it into space.\nThat's the problem with the movie. If a character can seemingly do anything, it's hard to feel tension or concern about his fate. (At least, Superman had kryptonite.) We are left with nothing but detached aesthetic appreciation: watching Rambo race through several million dollars worth of explosions and aerial attacks, coruscant fireballs billowing everywhere and bodies flying hither and yon. Except for anyone irretrievably into violent power fantasies, this will probably soon pall.\nThere's more than an addled premise (Rambo alone rescuing America's MIAs). There's the sort of love interest you thought vanished with Debra Paget's old Indian robes: the alleged Vietnamese guide Co Bao (Julia Nickson), who wears mascara and guerrilla pantaloons, has light eyes and speaks dialogue of the \"we go now, forget me never\" variety.\nOne cannot call the film unprofessional. The cast is good, Jack Cardiff photographs Acapulco (disguised as Indochina) stunningly, Mark Goldblatt and Mark Helfrich edit with machine-gun crispness and a dozen stunt men and pilots continually raise the hair on your head. Director George Cosmatos (\"The Cassandra Crossing\") marshals these forces with the gusto of a Westmoreland, the warmth of a Patton, the wit of a Zhukov.\nBut \"Rambo\" is a movie with absolutely no inner life. It's a series of exhortations punctuated by bomb bursts. (The screenplay, co-written by Stallone and \"The Terminator's\" James Cameron, oddly combines Cameron's zingy paranoia with Stallone's muscle-flexing optimism.) At the end, when Rambo, asked what he wants out of life, screams hoarsely that America must recognize and accept Vietnam vets, it seems less a logical response from a fatigued (and mud-spattered) hero than Stallone yelling his guts out to audiences everywhere.\nWouldn't it be nobler testimonial to the men who suffered in Vietnam to recognize their non-combatant contributions and to help them in battling scourges like indifference and Agent Orange-related diseases, rather than dream up multimillion-dollar fantasies about winning a war that ended more than a decade ago?\n'RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD II' A Tri-Star release.

{"text":"The cryptocurrency craze is reaching frenzied levels as 2017 draws to a close.\nBarely in the cents when trading was started at the beginning of this decade, the price of the signature currency - bitcoin - has jumped some twentyfold this year from nearly US$ 1,000 to surge past the US$20,000 mark.\nWhile monetary authorities in various parts of the world are sounding the alarm about the intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies, there is a lesser-known danger posed by these \"cryptos\" (as they are sometimes known). Beneath the veneer of a fast buck, little attention is paid to the exact magnitude of energy that is required round the clock to churn out such currencies.\nA crypto is generated in cyberspace where so-called \"miners\" verify and link transactions to blocks and solve what is called \"proof-of-work\" problems. These are complicated mathematical problems that get increasingly harder to solve. Miners thus have to demonstrate the work done to find a \"hash\" that is acceptable and this is shown through the amount of processing power used. In other words, the value of a crypto comes from the computations done.\nTherein lies the problem. Computer processing in itself is energy intensive. To create cryptos, much electricity is needed to run the processors. In addition, these emit much heat when in operation. Huge fans are needed to cool the systems so that they do not break down, and this causes even more energy to be used.\nThe ongoing race is for the miners to have the fastest processors to solve problems of escalating difficulty. In the beginning, consumer-grade systems such as graphics processing units could be used to generate cryptos. But this is not possible now and professional miners currently deploy high-end application-specific integrated circuit chips which are solely dedicated for crypto-mining.\nThe race for cryptos has reached a stage where a whole new industry of cryptocurrency mining is being spawned.\nChina alone accounts for 58 per cent of the bitcoin mines. But the \"dirty secret\" is that many of these mines run on electricity from coal, which is a most environmentally unfriendly source of energy (in total, China gets 60 per cent of its electricity from coal). As an illustration, there is a mine in Inner Mongolia, a province of China, which has eight metal warehouses, each 100m long, with a total of 25,000 computers just to mine bitcoins. Interestingly, there are also clusters of mines in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan that tap the on-site sources of hydroelectricity.\nOther countries are chasing the crypto trophy too. It is reported that the Russians are seriously keen on dominating crypto mining. We are facing a stage where massive amounts of energy will be consumed for the creation of cryptos. This goes beyond the bitcoin itself. In fact, there are now more than 1,300 types of cryptos and the number is increasing rapidly given the ongoing rage of ICOs - initial coin offerings.\nSo how much energy is actually utilised in the production of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoins? As a quick gauge, a single bitcoin transaction has been reported to use the same amount of energy to power nine homes in the United States for one day.\nThe total computing power amassed by the bitcoin network is some 100,000 times larger than the world's 500 fastest supercomputers put together.\nIn terms of energy amount, the bitcoin hardware taps some 31 terawatt-hours per year (1 terawatt is 1 trillion watts or 1 million million watts). This amount is greater than the energy usage of 150 countries or three-quarters of all countries in the world.\nThe even worse news is that the energy consumption of bitcoins is rising at an increasing rate per day. As of now, this rate is estimated to be 450 gigawatts per day (1 gigawatt is 1 billion watts).\nAs a related worry, there are even cases where cyber criminals are using \"botnets\" to exploit the processing power of their victims' computers through hidden software embedded in popular websites. There are probably about 220 such websites that carry these software with a global reach of some 500 million users. In other words, half a billion people may be unwittingly mining cryptos for other people who exploit free computing power for their illegitimate benefits.\nBut the greatest worry is what will happen if cryptos' ravenous appetite for power continues unchecked. According to one projection by Digiconomist, a cryptocurrency publication, more energy will be exhausted by bitcoins than the whole of the US by July 2019, and the entire world's energy consumption will be surpassed by the end of 2020.\nLet's compare crypto transactions with those of traditional credit cards. Digiconomist estimated that the present Visa payment system uses the energy equivalent of 50,000 US households to run 350 million transactions, while bitcoin uses the energy equivalent of 2.8 million US households to run 350,000 transactions. In other words, bitcoin transactions are 56,000 times more energy hungry than Visa's.\nSo the whole crypto craze is not just about the rise and rise of prices. It is also about the fallout from crypto mining's massive and ever-increasing demand for energy. While some analysts disagree with Digiconomist's projection, there is no dispute over crypto mining's very serious - and rising - drain on energy resources.\nWith all the rhetoric and efforts expended to mitigate global warming and climate change, it seems quite out of place that we forget about the elephant in the room, namely bitcoin. While the miners and speculators are laughing all the way to the bank, the rest of us are paying the price for their free-riding on the environment.\nthe bitcoin hardware taps some 31 terawatt-hours per year. This amount is greater than the energy usage of 150 countries or three-quarters of all countries in the world.\nNaturally, regulation is the solution for any problem that has an externality where costs are borne by others. This is indeed the case for pollution, as we see in carbon taxes or carbon trading schemes.\nBut cryptos are difficult to regulate as it is difficult to ring-fence the transactions. Tax, in particular, is not feasible. Buyers and sellers will find any jurisdiction that offers the best deal and, in cyberspace, locating such havens is not difficult.\nA new global financial order is probably necessary for effective monitoring of crypto advancements before the planet experiences a burnout. That's probably a tall order given the transboundary nature of the problem, not to mention its virtual dimension.\nGovernments around the world can try to band together and outlaw cryptos altogether but that may not be possible given the inherent nature of the underlying technology. Indeed, cryptos riding on the so-called blockchain approach may have reached the point of no return.\nCryptos are here to stay. The damage their creation is likely to inflict on energy and environmental sustainability is real. We cannot stand by and watch while crypto-scrapers dig for profits at our expense. While they have their blockchains, we lose our food chains.\nAs individual consumers, we can probably do our bit to protect the world. So, before we buy that bitcoin, think again. •The writer is director of the Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations at NUS Business School, National University of Singapore.

{"text":"Rubber stamp likely in early 2015.\nNBN Co expects to have reached a deal to resign its $11.2 billion definitive agreements with Telstra by the end of the year, with the network builder’s chief executive today revealing the two had reached material agreement on the new contract.\nThe Coalition Government had originally promised to have the historic renegotiation complete by mid-2014, but Telstra boss David Thodey recently said he expected the discussions to continue into 2015.\nThe signing of the new contract will be vital for the Coalition’s rollout of its new multi-technology mix NBN, which replaces the former predominantly FTTP-approach with a mixture of network technologies - including a larger focus on fibre-to-the-node using Telstra’s infrastructure.\nCommunications Minister Malcolm Turnbull in February said the deal would be done “certainly by the middle of the year”, but delays in negotiations relating to where the responsibility for certain issues lies; the regulatory issue of the TPG fibre-to-the-basement threat; and the technical guidelines for the MTM, such as who maintains the last leg of copper lines stretched the discussions out.\nThe ACCC has since ruled TPG’s rollout of FTTB in capital cities was not in breach of NBN anti-cherry picking provisions, while the federal government is planning to force telcos undertaking such efforts to functionally separate their wholesale and retail businesses and offer rival service providers regulated wholesale services.\nAt the network builder’s first quarter results briefing today, NBN Co chief executive Bill Morrow said the new agreement was “very close to being signed” and the issue now was more around specific language included in the contract rather than any material differences.\nHe said he expected the deal to be signed before the end of the year, and the following regulatory and government approvals to stretch into 2015.\nNBN Co is also working to resign its $834 million (in today's value) contract with Optus for its HFC network, which Morrow expected would be completed at the same time as the new Telstra deal.\nNBN Co reported revenue growth of 32 percent to $29 million for its first quarter of fiscal 2015, and a 16 percent boost in serviceable premises to 639,927 as at the end of September. End users with an active service came in 27 percent higher at 266,984.\nWhen questioned on the discrepancy in the amount of serviceable premises compared to those taking up the service - especially given NBN Co’s goal of 70 percent penetration for the 8 million premises to be connected by 2020 - Morrow said the penetration rate within the 15 FSAMs to be switched off copper indicated the “signs were positive” that the company would reach that goal.\nHe also revealed NBN Co had integrated all its 121 points of interconnect, and expected the remainder of the transit network - which will link all the POIs with 54,000 kilometres of fibre - to be completed this year.\nMorrow also trumpeted the company’s FTTN trial in the NSW suburb of Umina, claiming previously announced average peak download and upload speeds of 90Mbps and 36Mbps respectively.\nHowever, NBN Co chief customer officer John Simon revealed those premises were located close to the node - between 300 and 500 metres away - and the speeds fell to around 50Mbps when the premise was located between 700 and 800 metres out.\nHe stressed it was an “early trial” on a limited number of customers, and NBN Co would be able to achieve a more accurate statistical sample when it commercialises the nodes later next year.\n“Obviously as you go further away, the line rate on the copper drops,” Simon said.\nChief operating officer Greg Adcock emphasised that only four of the customers involved in the trial were receiving speeds under 50 Mbps.\n“This is a trial and we are learning,” he said.\n“We do have an obligation set by the Government that 90 percent of the fixed-line footprint will be at 50Mbps and no-one will be less than 25Mbps,” CEO Morrow said.\nNBN Co reported capital expenditure of $677 million for the period - with a total of $6.3 million so far in the project - and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $252 million.\nOperating expenses came in at $281 million, while the company received $997 million worth of Government funding, bringing its total of the allocated $29.5 billion so far to $9.4 billion.\nAverage revenue per use grew four percent to $39.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T16:43:45Z","url":"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/nbn-co-expects-telstra-deal-to-be-signed-by-christmas-397113"}

The North American market will hit the No. 2 spot with $1.5 billion, while Asia ($1.1 billion) and the rest of the world ($0.6 billion) will follow.\nPut together, the VR industry will generate $5.1 billion in 2016, according to SuperData's report.\nThat's up from $660 million in 2015, when headsets were only available to developers. SuperData added that it expects the VR market to swell to $8.9 billion in 2017 and climb to $12.3 billion in 2018.\nIn terms of sales by model, SuperData predicts that \"light\" mobile VR experiences, such as Google Cardboard, will lead the charge with 27.1 million units sold in 2016. Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are estimated to sell a combined 6.6 million units, \"Premium\" mobile VR devices like Samsung Gear VR will move 2.5 million units, while Sony's PlayStation VR will come in last with 1.9 million.\nBy the end of 2016, there VR market will reach an install base of 55.8 million consumers, SuperData said.\n\"Looking at the consumer market in more detail, we observe that especially younger consumer groups show a strong interest in virtual reality,\" SuperData said in the report. \"However, this consumer group does do not have the spending power necessary to support high-end devices. It is the more mature demographics that have the disposable income, with 18-54-year-olds saying they're willing to spend around $280 for hardware. Likewise, emerging markets like China are volume-reliant since average user revenue is low. Platform holders will initially heavily subsidize their hardware to build up significant market share.\"\nThe report also sheds some light on gamer interest by genre.

{"text":"She's been flying back and forth between New York and South Africa every week as she films The Giver.\nBut the strain of the international travel appeared to have little to no affect on Katie Holmes as she took a break from shooting in Cape Town, on Friday, perhaps thanks to some well applied make-up.\nThe 34-year-old looked remarkably rested and relaxed as she checked her phone in-between scenes on set of the adaptation of the classic children's novel.\nThe actress sported a brown leather trench coat as she leaned against a building during her break.\nScrolling through her phone, Katie did belie a hint of fatigue while keeping warm in a pair of motorcycle boots.\nCompleting her costume was a pair of jeans as she wore her dark locks in a snug bun.\nThe star has been making the gruelling flight between the two continents - which takes a minimum of 18 hours - regularly so she can spend time with daughter Suri, seven, on the weekends but still be back to film her new movie during the week.\nBut it was only two days prior that Katie was spotted struggling to stifle a series of yawns as she emerged from hair and makeup on the Cape Town set on Wednesday.\nWhile she was about to step in front of a camera, the Thank You For Smoking star seemed like she was having trouble just putting one foot in front of the other.\nChatting to the production crew, the actress looked over some additional lines as she shuffled along in a long white robe that she wore over a pair of grey pants and grey T-shirt.\nThe star certainly looked different from when she stepped off the plane the day before on Tuesday.\nWith not a spot of makeup on and with her locks hardly brushed, she looked like she was far from ready for her closeup.\nPoorly fitting jeans and nondescript sweater didn't help elevate her appearance.\nThe dressed down look was a sharp contrast to the cover girl look she proudly showed off in Manhattan just three days earlier.\nWith groomed hair and nicely applied lip gloss and eye makeup, she sparkled, looking every bit the glamorous movie star that she is.\nBut the dedicated actress is clearly intent upon giving her all to The Giver, which is based on the controversial best-selling novel by Lois Lowry.\nThe book, and now the film, tells the story about a society which has gone to great - and sinister - extremes to make everything equal and peaceful.\nThe science fiction film is based around Jonas (played by Brenton Thwaites), who learns of the real world outside his idyllic life.\nKatie plays his mother, while True Blood star Alexander Skarsgard portrays his father.\nThe children's novel initially created controversy with many criticising the inappropriateness of the subject matter for children.\nThe Giver is slated for release on August 15 2014.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T00:25:12Z","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2512478/Katie-Holmes-beats-jet-lag-applied-make-set-The-Giver-gruelling-week-travel-filming.html"}

{"text":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer has always been one of my great heroes of the faith. Such appreciation, of course, hardly makes me distinct. Bonhoeffer, the German pastor-theologian who opposed the Nazis and was executed in a concentration camp, is passionately admired by millions of Christians.\nOne could even compare him to Athanasius, the defender of Christ's divinity whose brave stance also drew state persecution. The fourth-century bishop's unflinching willingness to defy even emperors and their armies was honored with the title \"Athanasius contra mundum\" (against the world).\nCharles Marsh's welcome biography, Strange Glory: A Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Knopf), paints a painstaking portrait of a faithful disciple every bit as resolute against Aryanism as Athanasius was against Arians. Marsh's exquisite eye for detail reveals the sheer unlikelihood of Bonhoeffer's emergence as the boldest opponent of efforts to Nazify the German church.\nAthanasius was bishop of Alexandria, the most powerful ecclesiastical figure in the Eastern empire. He wielded so much influence that emperors were afraid of opposing him too forcefully, lest they provoke a popular uprising.\nBut what power did Bonhoeffer wield in 1933? He was 27 years old, financially dependent on his parents, and virtually bereft of experience in the working world. His sole professional appointment was an unpaid, non-tenure-track position as a voluntary lecturer.

{"text":"Trump hugs a US flag at a rally in October.\nOne of the United States' most important defense alliances may be unraveled or reoriented by President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office, based on a review of his campaign statements, in a shake-up that would affect the country's longtime role as a global police officer.\nIt's a position that aligns closely with that of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose spokesman said on Thursday that Putin and Trump \"set out the same main foreign policy principles, and that is incredible.\"\n\"It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in comments broadcast by Russian state TV's Channel One.\n\"And that is probably a good basis for our moderate optimism that they will at least be able to start a dialogue to start to clear out the Augean stables in our bilateral relations,\" he said.\nPeskov's comments came after reports emerged Thursday morning that the Trump campaign had been in contact with the Kremlin before the election.\nTrump has questioned the value of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization along the campaign trail. He has postulated that the US should not be obligated to come to the defense of its NATO allies if they \"aren't paying their bills.\"\nNotably, President Barack Obama has also criticized some NATO members in the past for not paying their fair share, and many foreign policy experts have argued that member countries should be pressured by the US to contribute more to the organization's operating costs.\nAn Abrams main battle tank for US troops deployed in the Baltics as part of NATO's Operation Atlantic Resolve.\nBut none has gone as far as to suggest, as Trump has, that the US disengage from the alliance completely because some of its members are not living up to various financial obligations.\nAs many experts say, the value of being allied with strategically positioned nations around the world — and being perceived as a global leader — far outweighs the financial losses that the US might incur from picking up some of the slack.\n\"Sooner or later, the mess created by a disengaged US will become a threat to the US itself, and the US will have to clean it up eventually to a much larger cost,\" Magnus Petersson, the head of the Centre for Transatlantic Studies at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, told NBC earlier this year.\nIan Bremmer, president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group, wrote in an article published Wednesday that a disengaged America and weakened NATO would lead to a strengthened Asian bloc capable of providing an alternative to \"lower-tier allies\" looking for protection.\nBetween May and July of this year, the Russians heightened their military posture throughout Europe and spurred talk of a renewed intervention in Ukraine.\nThe country stopped short of provoking an armed NATO response, but it warned Europe that it could find itself in Russia's \"crosshairs\" if NATO didn't back down from plans to conduct war games in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\nUS Army soldiers guard as Air Force F-22 Raptor fighters are parked in the military air base in Siauliai, Lithuania.\n\"The newer members of NATO — and especially the Baltics — have reason to be very concerned,\" Stephen Biddle, an adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations and professor of political science at George Washington University, told Business Insider on Wednesday.\n\"They're not rich enough or big enough to defend themselves against the Russians, and a Trump administration's willingness to help them is very unclear,\" he said.\nIt's more unclear given Trump's stated admiration for Putin, as well as his apparent desire to work more closely with Russia to fight terrorism once he takes office.\nFrom threats about pulling out of NATO to altering the GOP's policy on Ukraine— which has long called for arming Ukrainian soldiers against pro-Russian rebels — Trump's rhetoric has consistently aligned with a narrative that continues to overwhelm the collective Russian psyche: namely, that the US is overly meddlesome and \"globalist.\"\nUS-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, largely because of two major Russian interventions, in Crimea and in Syria, since 2014.\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg congratulated Trump on his election victory in a statement on Wednesday. But he reminded the president-elect of the \"solemn\" and \"unconditioned\" commitment all NATO members have to the organization.\n\"NATO's security guarantee is a treaty commitment,\" said Stoltenberg, who cautioned over the summer that NATO's security depends on US security, and vice versa.\n\"All allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other,\" he said.

{"text":"As the car that practically spearheaded Toyota’s rise as the country’s best-selling automotive brand, the Toyota Vios needs little introduction. It’s the modern day ‘people’s car,’ attracting car shoppers with its affordability, easy maintenance, and of course, its Toyota badge. There was just one problem: its NZ engine, now more than a decade old, was starting to show its age. In terms of fuel economy, it wasn’t keeping up with the competition, and consumers were starting to notice. Toyota isn’t the country’s top automotive marque for nothing, however, and they’ve been keenly listening in to their costumers’ wants and needs. Their response comes in the form of the Vios’ new powertrain — Toyota’s Dual VVT-I 1NR-FE engine paired with a CVT transmission. Let’s take a deeper look to see what else has changed.\nThe Toyota Vios hasn’t changed its looks much since 2013, and that’s a testament to how well the design holds up over time. Its well-proportioned silhouette is complemented by a large grille, flanked by two chrome-plated foglamp housings. At the rear, the trunk’s chrome strip extends its design across the rear tail lights. It’s a nice touch and shows some attention to detail which you don’t normally see in entry level vehicles. A small spoiler highlights the rear, giving the Vios a touch of sporty attitude. It’s an easy design to play around with, though its looks would be much improved with wheels larger than the 15-inch alloys it comes with.\nIf you’ve got a keen eye, you’ll notice some slight changes with the interior. There are new silver highlights on the AVT touchscreen and shift knob, and brushed aluminum details on the dash and door panels. The soft-touch plastics and leather stitched-style treatment on the dash enhance the premium level of the cabin, to the point where you’ll almost forget you’re in a B-segment vehicle. Typical of Toyota, the interior build quality is remarkable to a car in this price category. Buttons and knobs feel solid to the touch, and the instrument cluster is clear and highly legible. There’s also ample space at the rear for three medium-sized adults, while two large adults will have nothing to complain about. The Vios’ steering wheel still doesn’t support telescopic adjustments, but getting into a comfortable driving position wasn’t a problem at all.\nOn paper, Toyota’s new NR engine seems like a step down from the old NZ power plant. At 108hp and 140Nm of torque, the new engine has slightly less torque than its predecessor. Whatever the specs are on paper, it’s a different story in the driver’s seat. The engine response is noticeably quicker at low speeds compared to the previous model. Where you once had to get the revs going to gain speed, acceleration happens at a more linear pace, and the Vios feels perfectly at home cruising at speeds of 100 km/h without any drama.\nThe CVT transmission does take a bit of driving excitement away, but is a sensible addition to the Vios, given its practical nature. The end goal is, after all, improved fuel economy. So how does it do? Thanks to the Dual VVT-I engine (which adjusts timings on both intake and exhaust camshafts) and CVT transmission, the Toyota Vios achieves an average of 10 kilometers per liter on mixed city and highway driving conditions. On pure highway conditions, 15 kilometers per liter is easily attainable. Goal achieved? We certainly think so.\nMany have tried to take a slice of the B-segment pie away from the Vios, but Toyota now has all the bases covered and locked down. The Vios offers driver and passenger airbags, complete connectivity to Bluetooth and MirrorLink devices, as well as six speakers, which is a lot of value for a sub-P1M car. With improved fuel efficiency, trustworthy Toyota reliability, and a P902,000 price tag, practicality simply doesn’t get any better than this.\nThe Philippines sells 300,000 brand new vehicles a year without retiring the same number of older cars. That’s one of the reasons why we have traffic gridlock.\n1.3 engine at 10km per liter?\nPrado is 2.7 and consume the same.\nThis is what old engine is ma konsumo.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T20:59:37Z","url":"https://newsbits.mb.com.ph/2017/01/20/best-selling-for-a-reason/"}
{"text":"Stephen Leone & Daniel Neumark, Attosecond Physics Laboratory, UC Berkeley.\nhe entire semiconductor industry, not to mention Silicon Valley, is built on the propensity of electrons in silicon to get kicked out of their atomic shells and become free. These mobile electrons are routed and switched though transistors, carrying the digital information that characterizes our age. An international team of physicists and chemists based at the University of California, Berkeley, has for the first time taken snapshots of this ephemeral event using attosecond pulses of soft x-ray light lasting only a few billionths of a billionth of a second.\nWhile earlier femtosecond lasers were unable to resolve the jump from the valence shell of the silicon atom across the band-gap into the conduction electron region, the new experiments now show that this transition takes less than 450 attoseconds.\n\"Though this excitation step is too fast for traditional experiments, our novel technique allowed us to record individual snapshots that can be composed into a 'movie' revealing the timing sequence of the process,\" explains Stephen Leone, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and physics.\nLeone, his UC Berkeley colleagues and collaborators from the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität in Munich, Germany, the University of Tsukuba, Japan, and the Molecular Foundry at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report their achievement in the Dec. 12 issue of the journal Science.\nLeone notes that more than a century has elapsed since the discovery that light can make certain materials conductive. The first movie of this transition follows the excitation of electrons across the band-gap in silicon with the help of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy, developed in the Attosecond Physics Laboratory run by Leone and Daniel Neumark, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry.\nIn semiconducting materials, electrons are initially localized around the individual atoms forming the crystal and thus cannot move or contribute to electrical currents. When light hits these materials or a voltage is applied, some of the electrons absorb energy and get excited into mobile states in which the electrons can move through the material. The localized electrons take a \"quantum jump\" into the conduction band, tunneling through the barrier that normally keeps them bound to atoms.\nThese mobile electrons make the semiconductor material conductive so that an applied voltage results in a flowing current. This behavior allows engineers to make silicon switches, known as transistors, which have become the basis of all digital electronics.\nThe researchers used attosecond XUV spectroscopy like an attosecond stop watch to follow the electron's transition. They exposed a silicon crystal to ultrashort flashes of visible light emitted by a laser source. The subsequent illumination with x-ray-pulses of only a few tens of attoseconds (10-18 seconds) in duration allowed the researchers to take snapshots of the evolution of the excitation process triggered by the laser pulses.\nUnambiguous interpretation of the experimental data was facilitated by a series of supercomputer simulations carried out by researchers at the University of Tsukuba and the Molecular Foundry. The simulations modeled both the excitation process and the subsequent interaction of x-ray pulses with the silicon crystal.\nThe excitation of a semiconductor with light is traditionally conceived as a process involving two distinct events. First, the electrons absorb light and get excited. Afterwards, the lattice, composed of the individual atoms in the crystal, rearranges in response to this redistribution of electrons, turning part of the absorbed energy into heat carried by vibrational waves called phonons.\nIn analyzing their data, the team found clear indications that this hypothesis is true. They showed that initially, only the electrons react to the impinging light while the atomic lattice remains unaffected. Long after the excitation laser pulse has left the sample -- some 60 femtoseconds later -- they observed the onset of a collective movement of the atoms, that is, phonons. This is near the 64 femtosecond period of the fastest lattice vibrations.\nBased on current theory, the researchers calculated that the lattice spacing rebounded about 6 picometers (10-12 meters) as a result of the electron jump, consistent with other estimates.\n\"These results represent a clean example of attosecond science applied to a complex and fundamentally important system,\" Neumark says.\nThe unprecedented temporal resolution of this attosecond technology will allow scientists to resolve extremely brief electronic processes in solids that to date seemed too fast to be approached experimentally, says Martin Schultze, who was a guest researcher in Leone's lab last year, visiting from the Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München. This poses new challenges to the theory of light-matter interactions, including the excitation step, its timescale and the interpretation of experimental x-ray spectra.\n\"But here is also an advantage,\" Schultze adds. \"With our ultrashort excitation and probing pulses, the atoms in the crystal can be considered frozen during the interaction. That eases the theoretical treatment a lot.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-25T21:44:03Z","url":"http://esciencenews.com/articles/2014/12/11/scientists.measure.speedy.electrons.silicon"}

{"text":"LONDON (ICIS)--Italy-headquartered energy group Eni is readying its Ravenna plant for a 50% capacity expansion during maintenance in August, a company source said on Tuesday.\nThe Ravenna site on the Adriatic coast, between Venice and San Marino, can produce either methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) or ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) and is currently geared to make the former.\nRavenna has a capacity of 140,000 tonnes, according to the ICIS Plants and Projects database, and so a 50% increase would lift this to around 210,000 tonnes.\nLasting for two and a half months, the expansion will allow the plant to more fully cater to Eni’s northern Italian refineries’ needs.\nIt is understood these currently require extra MTBE to be bought, beyond Ravenna’s current output.\nWhether the plant will be run at full level once the expansion is complete will depend on the availability of the feedstock for MTBE, Raffinate-1, which is still uncertain, suggested the source.\nThis is a reference to a possible tightening availability of C4 streams thanks to a potential switch in the production process upstream which has previously taken place during the summer.\nThere has typically been a swap away from using naphtha cracking, and instead cracking the heating fuel liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which is often cheaper during summer months because it is in less demand. This produces less crude C4, which is where Raffinate-1 comes from.\nAvailability of Raffinate-1 would therefore typically be down during the summer, as suggested by another MTBE seller in the past week.\nHowever this seasonal swing is believed to have smoothed out in recent years, with crackers finding LPG to have consistently provided better margins throughout the whole of the year.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T00:42:35Z","url":"https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2016/07/05/10013614/eni-s-italy-mtbe-plant-to-grow-capacity-50-in-august"}
{"text":"There are the rivalries that infect the heart, never to be repeated. If you loved the Brooklyn Dodgers then you hated the Giants. And here, if you cheer for Magallanes, then you despise Caracas.\nEdgardo Alfonzo, the Mets' rising star, is the third baseman for Magallanes, the team situated in this city, and for years, his older brother Edgar played for Caracas -- the big brother of all cities in Venezuela, the capital, a two-hour drive east of here. The Alfonzos competed ferociously in the winter league, feeding the feud.\nIn that crucible, Edgardo Alfonzo developed the skills that have turned him into a budding star in New York, the major market in the major leagues. He hit .315 last season, ranked second in the National League with a .417 batting average with runners in scoring position, and finished second in Gold Glove Award voting, behind San Diego's Ken Caminiti. Eligible for salary arbitration this winter, he is in a position to make a great deal of money. In large measure, he has Edgar and the rivalry with his brother to thank for that.\nIn one game between Magallanes and Caracas, Edgardo charged a slow grounder hit by his brother, fielded it near the mound and threw spectacularly to first for the out, glancing pointedly at Edgar afterward.\nAn inning or two later, Edgardo slammed a line drive destined for the left-field corner, until speared by Edgar Alfonzo, the Caracas diving third baseman.\nHaving restored order, Edgar grinned, and Caracas fans excitedly waved their flags and blew into noisemakers. They understood the feud: Caracas vs. Magallanes, Edgar vs. Edgardo. But they could not see all the layers in the dense relationship between rival siblings.\n''It's something that's hard to put into words,'' said Edgardo, the youngest of four Alfonzo children, sitting last week in Villa Madrid, a restaurant here.\nEdgar, the first-born, came along in 1967, the year after his parents met and married, in a case of love at first sight. Edgar Alfonzo Sr. was on a job when he met Mercedes Pino, and in spite of the objections of her mother, they married within four months. Edgar Sr. drove a truck for a medical supplier, keeping him away from home in the small town of Miranda (population: 1,000) until late at night, or a week or two at a time.\nHe casually followed the careers of the best Venezuelan baseball players, such as Luis Aparicio and Vic Davalillo, but he did not play the game. Rather, he played jacks, gambling for money as a teen-ager. Baseball, he thought, was something only tots should play, certainly not a prospective vocation.\nFor growing boys, baseball was a waste of valuable time, he thought, a lure away from school and the education that could prove pivotal in their lives. The children of Edgar and Mercedes would concentrate on their school and go to a university; he would see to that.\nBut Edgar Jr. could not forget about baseball, and when his father's job took him out of Miranda, the boy would sneak off to play. Mercedes Alfonzo knew what her oldest son was doing, but never told her husband. When Edgar Sr. returned from work, Edgar could only sit home and wince over the thought of his friends playing nearby.\nBut the periods of inactivity hardly dulled his skills. By the time he was 14, Edgar was playing baseball with young adults, 20 or 21 years old, and one afternoon, before an important game, a handful of them went to the Alfonzo house to speak with Edgar Sr. Your son is a very good player, one of them told the father, and you should come watch him play today.\nEdgar Sr. agreed, and the boy, distracted by the presence of his father and feeling as if this was a one-day audition, struck out three times. He returned home crestfallen, certain that his father would be furious.\n''I know you were nervous because I was there,'' Edgar Sr. told his son, and they made a deal: Edgar Jr. had one year to prove himself. If he could not, he would quit baseball for good and then concentrate on school. Attending a game shortly thereafter, Edgar Sr. found himself being pestered by a friend convinced of Edgar's greatness. His friend bet Edgar Sr. that the boy would hit a home run that day, and when Edgar did so, his father lost a six pack of beer. Happily.\nWithin three years, Edgar Jr. signed a contract to play for Caracas. The first time the skinny teen-ager appeared on television in Miranda, Edgardo could hear his neighbors yelling in their houses, shouting, laughing. Asked last week about the moment, their father paused, his eyes watering. ''My first son,'' he said in Spanish, before looking down.\nPride surged through Edgardo, then 11 years old, tempered by concern for his brother's success. ''I was hoping nobody would hit a ball to him,'' Edgardo recalled.\nTo Edgardo, who was still playing in the sandlots, his older brother was a hero, someone to emulate. They had always been close. On those rare moments they bickered, their father would admonish them. You must not fight, Edgar Sr. would say. You are brothers.\nEdgar signed with the California Angels when he was 17, and his departure for the United States was traumatic, with all the Alfonzos gathered at the airport in Caracas. He called home three times his first day away, homesick, but, his father recalled, he sounded both sad and excited. Edgar was pursuing his dream.\nHe would return to Miranda every fall, sharing his used equipment and experience with his two brothers. Even when Edgardo was little, Edgar was sure his little brother would be a great player. He remembers watching Edgardo play a Little League game when he was 11. Twice Edgardo stopped grounders with a dive and rose to make wicked throws, and the line drives off his bat generated a peculiar sound.\nEdgar gradually climbed through the minors, establishing himself as a useful utility player. But his batting average fluctuated, injuries hampered him, and he did not have the speed to steal bases or the power to hit home runs consistently. In 1990, he had 2 hits in 11 at-bats for Class AAA Edmonton, and thereafter, his career bogged down in the minor leagues.\nHis kid brother, Edgardo, playing shortstop and second base, turned 17 in 1990, and thought about signing with Caracas. Edgar, then 23, encouraged him to consider all his options. Another team would have more opportunity; Caracas had a logjam of older players. Edgardo signed to play with Magallanes in Venezuela, and with the Mets in the United States. Edgar bragged to his manager with Caracas, Phil Regan, that Edgardo would be a terrific player.\nThat summer, Tamargo said, it became apparent Edgardo would be a good major league player or better.\nThat summer, Edgar realized that his career might stall in the minor leagues or worse. He was playing for Class AA Bowie, in the Baltimore organization, in the same league as his brother. The first time Bowie played at Binghamton, Edgar went to Edgardo's small, shared apartment for dinner.\nEdgar Alfonzo, now 30, lives with his wife and children in Texas, and departed Monday to play in Taiwan. After three major league seasons, Edgardo Alfonzo, now 24, is a celebrity in Venezuela, his stature approaching that of Andres Galarraga of the Atlanta Braves. The first time Alfonzo played for Magallanes this season, fans at Jose Bernardo Perez Stadium stood and cheered. At the Villa Madrid, patrons and waiters occasionally interrupt him as he discusses Edgar.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T19:20:29Z","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/14/sports/baseball-lessons-sibling-rivalry-alfonzo-learned-game-competitor-his-brother.html"}
{"text":"— It’s not quite Eloise at the Plaza, but Olivia the Pig had a good thing going in the Village. The star of the children’s book (and now television) series, and her author Ian Falconer, had been living in a townhouse at 45 West 9th Street for the past three years, purchased for $4.6 million. According to city records, the house sold for $4.1 million back in May, though the deal was only filed yesterday. The original asking price, from Sept. 22 (one week after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, it should be noted) was $7.1 million. The buyer was Kirat Singh, a managing director at Bank of America, and Yue Chen. There hasn’t been a new Olivia book since Olivia Helps with Christmas in 2007, but Mr. Falconer’s new collaboration with David Sedaris, Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary, should help make up for his loss on the house.\n— Congrats to Elliman super-broker Dolly Lenz. Following yesterday’s big news that there’d been a split between her team and the storied-but-troubled Apthorp, Lenz finally sold a spectacularly remade limestone townhouse at 123 East 61st Street, according to city records. The house was purchased back in 2007 for $7.9 million, had a brand-new facade put on — “rich mahogany-clad bay windows and high ironwork entrance gate convey classic Upper East Side elegance,” according to Ms. Lenz’ listing — and was then put back on the market in February of last year for $17.5 million. That not being the best time for such a sale, the price was knocked down to $13.95 million in July 2009. The final price was $12.1 million, well below asking but still representing a handsome profit, even after renovations.

{"text":"Google's artificial-intelligence researchers at DeepMind have developed a new algorithm that improves its game-play capabilities.\nAfter mastering dozens of 2D Atari games, and whopping humans at Go, Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence (AI) is now taking on new 3D navigation and puzzle-solving games.\nOne of these new games that DeepMind's AI agents are tackling is ant soccer, in which it's learned how to chase down a ball, dribble, and then score a goal.\nWhat's impressive, DeepMind's David Silver explained in a blogpost, is that its AI is capable of solving the ant soccer challenge \"without any prior knowledge of the dynamics\", reflecting recent advances it's made in 'reinforcement learning' (RL), or learning through trial and error.\nTo get these results, DeepMind has combined RL with deep learning of neural networks and its Deep Q-Network (DQN), an algorithm that stores a bot's experiences and estimates rewards it can expect after taking a particular action.\nIt was this algorithm that allowed it to master dozens of 2D games on an Atari 2600, but Silver says it's now developed a far better version of the algorithm.\nFor example, it can now train a single neural network to learn multiple Atari games. The technique is also being used to power recommendations in Google.\n\"We have also built a massively distributed deep RL system, known as Gorila, that utilises the Google Cloud platform to speed up training time by an order of magnitude; this system has been applied to recommender systems within Google,\" Silver noted.\nHowever, the ability to learn how to play soccer comes from DeepMind's newly developed 'asynchronous actor-critic algorithm, A3C', which the company set out in a revised paper last week, demonstrating that it could use standard multi-core CPUs to surpass GPU-based algorithms at solving motor-control problems and navigating random 3D mazes using visual input.\n\"It achieves state-of-the-art results, using a fraction of the training time of DQN and a fraction of the resource consumption of Gorila,\" Silver noted.\nDeepMind is testing this against Labyrinth, \"a challenging suite of 3D navigation and puzzle-solving environments\". The agents only use visual cues to figure out the map to \"discover and exploit\" rewards, Silver said.\n\"Amazingly, the A3C algorithm achieves human-level performance, out of the box, on many Labyrinth tasks,\" he wrote.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T04:51:02Z","url":"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-google-deepminds-ant-soccer-skills-can-help-improve-your-search-results/"}
{"text":"ORLANDO, Fla. -- While Lenny Wilkens was speaking with reporters outside of the Milk House Gym at Walt Disney World, New York Knicks president and head coach Isiah Thomas, the man who fired Wilkens two years ago, hugged the Hall of Fame coach and before a short conversation.\nPerhaps Thomas was sharing with Wilkens the Knicks' interest in acquiring Rashard Lewis. According to NBA insiders, the Knicks could make the Sonics a sign-and-trade offer for Lewis that could include Seattle natives Nate Robinson and Jamal Crawford.\nCrawford is owed $35 million over the next four seasons, and the Knicks could add Robinson's contract or that of Channing Frye to come within 75 percent of a new Lewis deal, per rules of the collective bargaining agreement.\nWilkens said Tuesday that the Sonics plan to sign Lewis, who opted out of his contract Friday and will be an unrestricted free agent July 1. To execute a sign-and-trade, the Sonics would have to sign Lewis to a new contract and then trade him.\nThe Sonics have the advantage in re-signing Lewis because they can offer him a six-year deal, compared with five for other clubs, and give Lewis 10.5 percent increases per season, compared with 8 percent for other clubs.\n\" He is a young player who was having a great year, and he wants to explore the market,\" Wilkens said. \"Yes (there are plans to re-sign him). He is an asset for us. We still want him, and we're going to try everything we can get him signed.\"\nThe Knicks, however, have made Lewis a major priority. They sorely lack a scoring small forward but would have to unload one of their unwanted contracts -- Crawford, Jerome James, Quentin Richardson, Malik Rose -- to acquire a quality player.\nIt's uncertain whether the Sonics would be interested in Crawford because of his contract and history of erratic shooting. He averaged 17.6 points per game this season but shot just 40 percent.\nWILLIAMS ABSENT: Former Roosevelt High standout Marcus Williams will not participate in the pre-draft camp and is not on the list of players set to take physicals.

{"text":"Learning how to answer tough interview questions can help you get the job you want.\nInterview questions that ask you what you will contribute to the company are designed to help employers weed out the best applicants. Your answer to this kind of question should demonstrate that you've done your homework on the company and understand its needs, and that you have the ability to think under pressure.\nResearch the company and the position you are applying for so you know how to formulate your answers. Read through the company's website to learn more about its culture, mission, strategic vision, management team and history. Try to find news or industry articles on the company that detail some of its recent growth initiatives as well as its strategy for winning market share from competitors. Find out what the company's current needs and priorities are and then use that information to answer the questions with confidence and without hesitation.\nProvide specific examples from your past work experiences that demonstrate how you used your skills to benefit previous employers. For example, you might discuss a recent project you completed on time and under budget, or how you set up a new software program that helped the company improve its performance. Explain in detail any contributions that you made for previous employers that helped them reach their goals. Next, explain how these skills and experiences can benefit the company you're interviewing with, using your research on the company to help inform your answers. If you aren't afraid to work overtime, let the hiring manager know that you are willing to work until your job is done and not watch the clock.\nWhen you are asked how you can contribute to the company, incorporate your own goals into what you can contribute to the company, then explain that you are looking for a career opportunity that leads to additional responsibilities. This will help highlight your drive and ambition and let the interviewer know that you are looking for something long-term. For example, if your personal goal is to bring in 10 new clients each month to exceed your own personal sales goals, this goal will also help increase your potential employer's sales and client base. You can also explain that you would like to increase your knowledge about the position by attending evening classes or learning a new software program. This goal will make you more valuable as a potential employee.\nBefore the interview, make a list of your strengths. Monster, an online career resource website, suggests that once you outline your strengths there should be at least three or four that match the job description. Provide specific examples of how your strengths align with the open position, and how they can help the company improve its performance.

{"text":"Aduro Biotech is laying off more than a third of its workforce in a restructuring intended to keep its focus on its cancer drugs now in clinical development.\nThe corporate shakeup will cut the headcount of Aduro (NASDAQ: ADRO) by 37 percent, the company announced Wednesday. At the end of the third quarter of last year, Aduro’s workforce totaled 155 full-time employees, including 117 in research and development, according to the Berkeley, CA, company’s quarterly report. Aduro says the remaining workers will turn their attention to the company’s lead programs.\nAduro develops immunotherapies, treatments that aim to coax the patient’s immune system to fight disease. The company’s lead therapeutic candidate focuses on activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) receptor in immune system cells, which is hoped can set off immune responses that tackle tumors. That drug, ADU-S100, is being developed in partnership with Novartis (NYSE: NVS), which committed $250 million up front to Aduro in 2015 to develop STING drugs. The Aduro STING drug is currently in Phase 1 testing in breast, head and neck, and renal cell cancers, as well as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Last month, Aduro added Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) as a partner in an alliance targeting the STING pathway to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. The deal calls for Lilly to provide Aduro with research funding.\nAnother partner, Merck (NYSE: MRK), has licensed an Aduro antibody that targets a molecule called CD27. The Aduro antibody at the center of that alliance, which was signed in 2015, is in preclinical development.\nNot all of Aduro’s partnerships have worked out. In October, Aduro disclosed that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) subsidiary Janssen Biotech would end its four-year alliance with the company and return rights to drugs that were being developed for lung and prostate cancers.\nIn addition to its STING drugs, Aduro says it will also focus on developing drugs that block a protein called APRIL, which is found in high levels in patients diagnosed with cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and colorectal carcinoma. The APRIL-blocking antibody drug BION-1301 is currently being tested in a Phase 1/2 study in multiple myeloma.\nAduro did not say how much money it expects the restructuring will save. The company says it finished 2018 with $277.9 million in cash.

Visibility was less than 2,000 metres on some roads.\nThe new policy has not been announced on the force's social media accounts.\nLast November, Abu Dhabi's transport authority gave the green-light for a new safety scheme slashing speeds on roads during bad weather, such as heavy rain, sandstorms and thick fog.\nThe Department of Transport's traffic safety committee agreed a plan to cut speed limits to 80kph when visibility for drivers is reduced to 200 metres or less.\nMotorists will be alerted to the reduced speed limits by notices on smart towers - structures displaying road messages - located on routes throughout the emirate.\nThe scheme will allow authorities to swiftly reduce limits and improve safety with quick effect during fog and dust storms.\nA leading UAE road safety campaigner backed the initiative, but also called on motorists to use common sense and adapt to adverse conditions.\n“It should go without saying that the speed limit has to go down and the distance between vehicles has to go up when visibility is poor,” said Thomas Edelmann, managing director of RoadSafetyUAE.\n“The level of driver attention also has to go up as well.

Phil Johnson has also returned from YM after three goal-studded seasons at Gorings Mead since he left Hassocks in the summer of 2015.\nJohnson was ruled out of this one through injury but the acquisition of him and Benson, both of whom featured in the Premier Division's golden boot chart last season, should help ensure that Hassocks manage more than the 38 goals they scored last time out which left them as the second lowest scorers in the division.\nIt was Heath who started the better of the two sides with Stuart Chester's pace and crossing ability and Fender's presence giving Harris and his back four of Harry Mills, Webster, Jordan Badger and Bradley Bant plenty to think about.\nFender had the first clear cut chance of the game when a lovely through ball from Lee Carney put him clear but he dragged his shot just wide of the post.\nAfter weathering the storm, Spencer Slaughter and Matt Berridge began to give Hassocks some control in midfield and the impressive Jake Lindsey drew a save from Heath's new goalkeeper Mark Fox with a long range effort.\nSpinks then found Benson with a visionary pass and Benson showed good strength to barge one-time Hassocks defender Glen Woodburn off the ball to leave himself one-on-one with Fox. Remarkably, referee Robert King awarded a free kick to Heath, much to the annoyance of everyone in red.\nThe last chance of the first half came when Hassocks failed to clear a corner with the ball eventually falling just outside the area to Marlon Maxwell but his brilliant connection was only rewarded with the shot flying just over the bar.\nNeither side seemed to have played to their potential in the first half with the main talking point being not about any of the new signings on the pitch, but the addition of Dark Fruits cider to the bar which went down a treat with supporters.\nHassocks were quickest out the blocks in the second half with Wilkins causing trouble down the right flank, his pull back finding Spinks who drew another comfortable save from Fox.\nHeath then had the best chance of the game, Ben Hands delivering a superb cross right onto the head of Fender but his powerful head was wonderfully kept out by the reflexes of Harris.\nThat save seemed to galvanise the Robins and Benson and the outstanding Berridge both went close to beat Fox before Spinks put the ball into the penalty area and just as Wilkins was about to pull the trigger, he was clumsily bundled over by Woodburn.\nMr King pointed straight to the spot and Benson made no mistake with the spot kick, beating Fox with ease to give the Robins the lead.\nIt was all Hassocks after that with Benson the centre of attention. He breezed his way into the box but instead of shooting, opted for the unselfish pass to Wilkins who was slightly off balance and as a result couldn't hit the target.\nHeath equalised shortly after with a real sucker punch. Scott Weller delivered a defence splitting pass to Fender who used his strength and pace to blast through and smash home an equaliser for 1-1.\nHassocks made a double change in response as Dan Stokes and Harvey Blake, the fifth new face on the day having signed from Mid Sussex Premier Division side Sporting Lindfield, took to the field.\nBlake had a lively cameo in his first 10 minutes in senior football. He was denied a debut goal by an excellent save from Fox after Wilkins had broken down the wing to cross and Blake then turned provider with a marauding run down the flank from which he found Benson but the Hassocks striker couldn't get the sort of connection he was looking for and it resulted in a comfortable save for Fox.\nThat was the final chance of the game with a draw just about the right result. There were certainly plenty of positives to take for the Robins ahead of a stern test against one of the title favourites, Chichester City on Tuesday night.\nHassocks: Alex Harris; Harry Mills, Jordan Badger, Dan Wesbter, Bradley Bant; Jack Wilkins, Spencer Slaughter, Matt Berridge, Jake Lindsey; Alex Spinks; Liam Benson.\nSubs: Dan Stokes, Harvey Blake (used).","timestamp":"2019-04-19T02:16:51Z","url":"https://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/sport/football/new-era-at-hassocks-starts-with-a-draw-1-8591545"}

{"text":"Lloyd Hull, seen here in 2014 with a D-Day shell casing fired from the USS Laffey, was a beloved Greenwich resident. His family is paying tribute to him with a concert in his memory from the London Philharmonic.\nGREENWICH — A local performance by the London Philharmonic will be dedicated to a Greenwich icon.\nWhile in the area for concerts this month at Lincoln Center, the London Philharmonic Orchestra will also pay a visit to Stamford for gala performance at 8 p.m. April 16 at The Palace theater.\nThe Stamford concert, a benefit for the local Young Artists Philharmonic, will be performed in memory of Lloyd Hull, a longtime Greenwich resident, World War II veteran and dedicated town volunteer. The choice to honor his memory was made by his one of his daughters, Lady Victoria Robey, an officer of the order of the British Empire who is also chairman of the philharmonic.\nShe, along with a committee of family members and Greenwich residents, organized the one-night stop in Stamford for the the 100-piece London Philharmonic.\nHull, who died in January 2018 at the age of 95, was known for his love of music. Singing was not Hull’s forte, said Bea Crumbine, a longtime friend and the town’s ambassador at large. But his musical tastes ranged from patriotic songs and Gilbert and Sullivan to Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Handel and “anything big and bold,” she said.\nWhat made Hull happiest, was hearing his wife, Mary, singing in the choir at church on Sundays, said Crumbine, who is part of the organizing committee.\nRobey agreed, saying that bringing people together was of great importance to her father.\n\"I am touched and honored that a world-renowned orchestra would come to our area and perform in honor of my father,\" Weicker said. \"I know Dad would have loved that some of the proceeds will benefit the Young Artists Philharmonic. It’s a great way to bring people together with music which is the universal language.\"\nTours by the London Philharmonic are planned years in advance, Robey said, so adding in a performance is not easy.\nBut when she saw the concerts lined up for Lincoln Center, Robey said it made sense to try to get the philharmonic to Connecticut. Chief executive and artistic director Tim Walker was open to the idea, she said, paving the way for the concert to come together.\nThe concert will open with Beethoven’s Egmont followed by Canadian violinist James Ehnes leading the way the Violin Concerto by Jean Sibelius. After the intermission, the orchestra will perform Gustav Mahler’s First Symphony.\nMembers of the Young Artists Philharmonic, based in Old Greenwich, will be part of a flute choir that will greet guests when they arrive at The Palace. That group will include eight students from Greenwich: Katharine Singer Jensen, Alexa Cervantes, Valeria Morales, Fiona Chen, Alondra Santana, Hannah Bang and Krishna Reddy.\nThe London Philharmonic’s work with the youth orchestra is part of its commitment to education. Robey said the orchestra works closely with London Music Masters, an organization called that teaches classical music in schools in England to children who might otherwise not have access to it.\nTickets are on sale at www.palacestamford.org.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T13:03:28Z","url":"https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/London-Philharmonic-will-pay-tribute-to-Greenwich-13737762.php"}
{"text":"A judge wrote that Chicago has shown a ‘‘likelihood of success’’ in its arguments that Attorney General Jeff Sessions overstepped his authority with the requirements.\nCHICAGO — Attorney General Jeff Sessions can’t follow through — at least for now — with his threat to withhold public safety grant money to Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities for refusing to impose new tough immigration policies, a judge ruled Friday in a legal defeat for the Trump administration.\nIn what is at least a temporary victory for cities that have defied Sessions, US District Judge Harry Leinenweber ruled that the Justice Department could not impose the requirements.\nHe said the city had shown a ‘‘likelihood of success’’ in arguing that Sessions exceeded his authority with the new conditions. Among them are requirements that cities notify immigration agents when someone in the country illegally is about to be released from local jails and to allow agents access to the jails.\nThe city had asked the judge for a ‘‘nationwide’’ temporary injunction this week, asking the judge not to allow the Justice Department to impose the requirements until the city’s lawsuit against the department plays out in court.\nChicago has applied for $2.2 million in the federal grant money — $1.5 million for the city and the rest for Cook County and 10 other suburbs. But in a recent court hearing, attorneys representing the city said that more than 30 other jurisdictions across the United States filed court briefs supporting Chicago’s lawsuit and have up to $35 million in grants at stake. At least seven cities and counties, including Seattle and San Francisco, as well as the state of California, are refusing to cooperate with the new federal rules.\nDuring a hearing, Ron Safer, an attorney representing the city, said that if the Justice Department prevailed, it could use the same argument to ‘‘seize’’ even more authority to tie grant money to doing what he wants.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T06:20:21Z","url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/09/15/judge-says-sessions-can-deny-grant-money-for-sanctuary-cities/QnqLBuObiYYyJwSBpxfl6O/story.html?s_campaign=breakingnews:newsletter"}
{"text":"Every June, the Los Angeles-based Women In Film foundation throws a lavish awards ceremony to celebrate women who are at the forefront of the industry.\nFounded in 1973 by Tichi Wilkerson Kassel – former editor in chief of The Hollywood Reporter – the Crystal & Lucy Awards recognise and promote talented female directors, actors, ­cinematographers, producers and critics, to help them break through the so-called “celluloid ceiling”.\nWomen in film still face plenty of obstacles, as seen in the recent Harvey Weinstein scandal and the resultant #TimesUp movement, as well as reports on the gender pay gap. A case in point: for the reshoots for 2017 film All the Money in the World, actor Mark Wahlberg earned US$2 million (Dh7.3m) for 10 days’ work, while his co-star Michelle Williams reportedly got paid $80 a day for the same period.\nFashion house Max Mara is a fervent supporter of Women In Film (WIF) – and this relationship began long before the topic of female empowerment became trendy, says MariaGiulia Prezioso Maramotti, Max Mara’s vice president for the United States and global brand ambassador. “Max Mara’s mission has been to empower women, by dressing them, for the past 67 years,” ­Maramotti explains. “It was just natural that we entered into a partnership with WIF as part of our way of communicating to our customers.\nThe Max Mara customer of which she speaks is, of course, female and drawn to the elegant, unfussy womenswear that the brand is famed for. Founded by Achille Maramotti in Italy in 1951, Max Mara’s aim was to blend high-end cuts and style with industrial tailoring techniques. In an era when most clothes were still handmade, this shift in approach was a game changer, ­offering garments that were still beautifully designed, but available at a far more affordable price.\nAlmost uniquely, the brand spoke to working women, creating smart, ­highly wearable solutions. The reaction was spectacular, with ladies flocking to snap up its creations. One piece in particular became an instant classic: the 101801 camel coat in supple wool and cashmere, which is still a bestseller. Coupling a quiet, ­under-the-radar aesthetic with smart yet practical dressing meant that by the time of his death in 2005, Achille Maramotti was the head of a company worth an estimated $1.2 billion. Today, the company is still owned and run by the Maramotti clan, with Achille’s granddaughter MariaGiulia representing the third generation of the family.\nThe brand’s partnership with WIF comes in the form of financial sponsorship, and led to the creation of the Max Mara Face of the Future Award, which every year selects one emerging actress deserving of special recognition. Past recipients including Kate Mara, Hailee Steinfeld, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth Banks, Ginnifer Goodwin and Emily Blunt, showing that Max Mara is not only ahead of the game in terms of promoting equality, but has a pretty good eye for talent, too.\nWhen not doling out accolades to up-and-coming talents, Max Mara runs a serious business trying to anticipate and cater to the needs of an ever-­evolving audience. Its ability to weather the vagaries of consumer demand can perhaps be attributed to the brand’s internal stability, both in terms of the consistency of still being owned by the same family, and of having the same designer at its helm for 30 years. The British-born creative Ian Griffiths has fashioned collections for Max Mara for more than three decades, and yet far from being a household name, most people have never heard of him.\n“The idea of a designer like Ian Griffiths being with the company for three decades means that he has grown with it, and there has been an intertwining between his vision and the one of the brand, which was obviously not revolutionary, yet evolved organically.\nFar from being staid and predictable, however, Griffiths has been – quietly – challenging boundaries. Max Mara was one of the first big-name brands to put the hijab-wearing Halima Aden on the runway in 2017, kick-starting not only her career, but forcing other designers to start thinking about diversity. Following in the footsteps of founder Achille, Griffiths has worked hard behind the scenes to ensure that the label keeps apace with the lives of modern women.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T02:57:39Z","url":"https://www.thenational.ae/lifestyle/fashion/max-mara-is-all-about-film-fashion-and-female-empowerment-1.750982"}

As a Republican, he served as mayor of Warwick from 1992 to 1999, when he was appointed to the U.S. Senate following the death of his father, Sen. John H. Chafee.

{"text":"It's a talented field and too close to call, but we're going to try.\nTo prepare for the 2019 Juno Awards, we're breaking down each of the four classical categories.\nHaving already analyzed the large ensemble category, we now turn our attention to classical album of the year: solo or chamber.\nNote how this category is a showdown this year between Analekta Records (three nominations) and Hyperion Records (two nominations). Whereas a number of the albums nominated in the large ensemble category are live recordings, all five nominees in the solo/chamber category are studio recordings, and the sound quality is consistently high. Two of the nominees are first-timers (Wan and Pouliot), Richard-Hamelin is enjoying his second nomination, while Gryphon Trio, Hamelin and Hewitt are Juno veterans with 11, 16 and 17 nominations, respectively.\nIt's a deserving bunch. Who's missing?\nIf there were room for a couple more nominees, we'd have liked to see Eybler Quartet's Beethoven String Quartets, Op. 18, Nos. 1-3 on the list. With their adherence to Beethoven's controversial original metronome marks, the members of Eybler Quartet got us to hear those familiar pieces in a new way, which is always exciting. Another great listen was Lachrimae, a collection of music by John Dowland played by Nigel North (lute) and Les Voix humaines (viol consort). We surrendered ourselves to the undulating phrases of these pavanes and galliards, so seductively played.\nAlas, there's only room for five. Here's our breakdown of this year's nominees, including predictions for who should win and who will win.\nThis September 2018 release marked the culmination of phase 1 of Wan and Richard-Hamelin's project to perform and record the complete cycle of Beethoven's 10 sonatas for violin and piano. Their partners in the endeavour are the Arte Musica Foundation, which presents the duo in concert at Montreal's Bourgie Hall, and Analekta Records, which holds recording sessions and produces the albums. It's a winning formula, as Vol. 1 of the series attests.\nHere, they play the three sonatas Beethoven published in 1803 as his Op. 30, works poised on the cusp: No. 6 is the most classical of the three; No. 7 the most Romantic; No. 8 falls stylistically somewhere in the middle.\nRichard-Hamelin applies a firm tone to the ominous piano opening of the seventh sonata, to which Wan replies with bite and assertive melodic leaps. Then, a translucent violin timbre draws you into the second movement's intimate tête-à-tête.\nIn Sonata No. 8, both musicians have fun with the frenzy of the first movement's churning compound meter before taking turns with the gracious melody of the second movement. A rustic dance, the third movement finds Richard-Hamelin setting the pace hurdy-gurdy-style while Wan fiddles away with abandon. It's a romp.\nBy contrast, the sixth sonata, which opens the album, is perfectly genteel. There's uncanny consensus on the phrasing in the outer movements, while the Adagio is the album's highlight with Wan providing nuanced colours and Richard-Hamelin transforming his piano part into a languorous Nocturne.\nWan and Richard-Hamelin form a winning duo. But will they win the Juno?\nWhile her global Bach Odyssey is ongoing, Hewitt has also been toiling away on two other projects for Hyperion Records: she's eight albums into the complete Beethoven piano sonatas, and she has released a second volume in her exploration of the keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, the latter of which got this Juno nod.\nFor this album, Hewitt was drawn to the sonatas with surprising elements, which she evidently enjoys accentuating. For instance, she leans deliciously on the bass line of K206, the longest piece on the album, to underscore an unusual shift from E major to E-flat minor. In K429, the absence of any melody to speak of does not deter her from making beautiful sense of this barcarolle, with its suspenseful pauses and descending runs. In K82, she treats us to one of the few Scarlatti sonatas that's written in fugal form. Of course, Hewitt knows fugues and she executes this one's 3/8 meter with characteristic clarity and elegance.\nAre the tempos a bit cautious? Maybe, although as audiences we've come to expect breakneck speed in Scarlatti's sonatas, which doesn't necessarily cast them in the best light. The ones Hewitt has chosen for this album reveal how wide-ranging these pieces are, in fact.\nHewitt has been nominated in this category six times since her last win in 2005. Will this album turn the tide?\nThis goes down as one of the best debut albums we've heard in a long time, and it was just one accomplishment among many for Pouliot in 2018: he won the Women's Musical Club of Toronto's 2018 Career Development Award and the Virginia Parker Prize, and his loan of the Canada Council's 1729 Guarneri del Gesù violin, valued at $6 million, was renewed for another three-year term.\nIt's on that instrument that he recorded these works by Ravel and Debussy, alongside his associate from the Colburn School in Los Angeles, pianist Hsin-I Huang. Pouliot's effusive personality is well-suited to Ravel's Tzigane, which he plays with raffish slides and perfectly tuned double stops. He and Huang make Ravel's familiar G Major Sonata sound brand new, with technical brilliance and astute characterizations throughout.\nSome violinists employ an austere tone for Debussy's moody Violin Sonata, his last completed work. Not Pouliot, whose rich, vibrant timbre brings greater intensity to its first movement and accentuates the impish nature of the second. He and Huang use the episodic structure of the third movement to tell a story so vivid it stays with you long after the music has ended.\nPouliot is on a roll. Will it continue with his first Juno Award?\nReleased in January 2018 to celebrate Gryphon Trio's 25th anniversary, this album pairs two works composed approximately 100 years ago: Maurice Ravel's famous Piano Trio in A Minor from 1914 and Clarke's Piano Trio, written in 1921. The album's title, The End of Flowers, refers to the devastation caused by World War I. \"Completed within the early frenzy and aftermath of this bleak chapter in human history, these brilliant works were not intended as memorials but stand as a testament to the enduring power of life and art,\" writes Gryphon Trio cellist Roman Borys in the album's notes.\nThe album begins with Clarke's trio, the heavier of the two. Pianist Jamie Parker establishes a violent mood with the dissonant machine-gun theme that opens the work and ties its three movements together. Lyrical passages come as a relief — for instance, in the second movement, when the strings shift to harmonics for a delicate accompanying motif while the piano introduces a simple melody, it's like a ray of light. The musicians do a fine job expressing the third movement's conflicting ideas of optimism and regret, the latter intruding in the form of a mournful bugle call.\nIn Ravel's ingenious trio, the musicians display the full range of their artistry. Props to violinist Annalee Patipatanakoon for her heartfelt restraint while introducing the lovely second theme of the first movement. There are shades of La Valse in their performance of the sprightly second movement, and warmly spun lines in the Passacaille. The final movement turns the three musicians loose in a rollicking sonata form in which they revel in electrifying tremolos, bombastic piano chords and the bouncy ride of an irregular meter. It's quite a climax!\nGryphon Trio's 25th anniversary was a party. Will the celebrations extend to a Juno win?\nCan you believe Hamelin made more than 75 albums for Hyperion Records without recording a note of music by Franz Schubert? It's a situation he amended in April with this highly anticipated record pairing Schubert's final piano sonata and his second set of Impromptus. \"I could have done it before,\" Hamelin told us when the album came out. \"It wasn't just a question of my developing a relationship with the work, it was also waiting until the trust of the public in what I do, in what I could do with it, would become greater and greater.\" It's safe to say he has earned that trust, and then some.\nHamelin, who's been playing the Sonata in B-flat Major in concert for decades, uses a remarkably restrained tempo for the opening movement, not only drawing attention to detail but also preparing the way for Schubert's varied treatment of the wistful main theme. Sensitive souls should proceed with caution in the second movement, whose A section Hamelin imbues with a feeling of inexorable regret — emotional stuff. A light touch and perfectly controlled dynamics make the third movement scherzo glow from within, and in the fourth movement, Hamelin unites the seemingly disparate ideas with intelligent timing and awesome technique.\nIn Schubert's Op. 142, which Hamelin says \"is probably as close to a sonata as it could be without actually being one,\" he invites us to hear the four Impromptus as a unified work, one without the tragic overtones of the final sonata. He plays down the sturm und drang of the first Impromptu in favour of a more tender interpretation. In the second Impromptu, we love the silky homogeneity of the chords and the lilting effect of his agogic treatment of the main theme. The variations of the third have all the charm of a strophic Lied, while Hamelin turns the scherzo and trio of the fourth into a demonic dance seemingly summoned from the pages of Goethe.\nFans seized this album when it was released. Will Hamelin seize a Juno trophy?\nWe got swept up in the excitement surrounding rising violin star Pouliot. His debut album is a joy to listen to and we think it deserves the Juno.\nThe Juno jury will be understandably wowed by Hamelin's Schubert statement, and the award will go to him.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T23:46:02Z","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/music/junos/features/classical-junos-who-should-win-the-solo-chamber-category-1.5018135"}
{"text":"Walter Chen is the founder and CEO of iDoneThis, the easiest way to share and celebrate what you get done at work, every day. On his downtime, he blogs about management, entrepreneurship, and happiness on the iDoneThis blog.\nGetting rid of managers may seem like just another tech trend, but much of the skepticism around going “bossless” or flat is due to misleading terminology. We don’t quite have a good vocabulary for it yet — no managers doesn’t mean no management, and flat structure doesn’t mean everyone has equal sway.\nPower, leadership, and even hierarchy still exist in these alternative structures, but instead of running along career ladders and hanging out in corner offices, they tend to be decentralized and dynamic rather than static and top-down.\nAt its heart, the move away from bosses is a reaction against command and control management. Bossy practices and overbearing pecking orders disconnect people from meaning and intrinsic motivation at work.\nTalented people don’t go into startups to follow step-by-step directions and wait for approval at every turn. They want to move fast, break things, discover, and create — not be treated like children.\nYour company doesn’t have to get rid of managers or implement some formal system to adopt practices that will help your employees flourish. You do, however, have to build a foundation of trust and set up ways to guide and enable your employees to be collaborative, peer-managing leaders.\nMoving towards bosslessness, as with these three approaches, is a process of figuring out a better way for great employees to thrive and develop great companies.\nEssentially, I try to create little mini-managers, each responsible for managing a single person: themselves.\nAt first this is mainly about teaching people how to figure out what to work on right now (prioritization). Then it’s more a matter of building their confidence both in themselves and their team to a point where they just do things they know is right without even talking to me (autonomy).\nRather than assigning and approving tasks at every turn, then, management is about keeping people in motion and getting out of their way.\nWhen you equip people with the knowledge they need to move forward, you don’t have to keep telling them what to do. Freeing the flow of information from gatekeepers and bottlenecks increases agility and resourcefulness.\nFor the multibillion dollar games company, Supercell, that takes the form of daily morning emails with details from project progress and revenue figures to help orient not just some top circle but every employee. CEO Ilkka Paananen explains: “If you provide people with the key information, you don’t need to tell people what to do, they can figure it out for themselves.\nBuzzfeed also makes work details transparent, inspired by a process started at Google called “Snippets”. Everyone sends in an email with what they get done and what they need help with to keep moving. Since people can subscribe to each other’s updates, Snippets provides an at-a-glance view of what’s happening in the company.\n[T]hat means that instead of everyone being the same, you embrace that everyone is different, and you look at the strength of connections between people, the communication channels, and how information travels amongst them.\nThese connections and channels are an important, often overlooked source of motivation, support, and information. Bosses don’t always know best, but peers tend to be equipped with the most relevant knowledge to provide feedback and recognition. They know when someone is stepping up or slacking because they see and deal with it first-hand.\nOne study by Greg Stewart and Stephen Courtright even found that when peers in cohesive self-managing teams have some control over each other’s rewards — such as raises, bonuses, and promotions, which traditionally exist as top-down edicts — both individual and team performance improve.\nShopify’s internal tool Unicorn is one such peer-driven bonus system where employees can give public kudos for great work and support. This also furnishes managers with on-the-ground information about how to best help people succeed.\nShopify’s bonus system won’t work for every team or company. Managing people rather than tasks requires you to think about your particular culture and people to implement the best tools and processes.\nWhat works for one organization’s culture may not for another, but the characteristics they share will be that people do great work together based on a sense of autonomy, trust, and shared accountability.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T22:32:50Z","url":"https://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/04/07/manage-talented-people-bossing-around/"}
{"text":"Russia is not in talks with Syria about supplying the Assad regime with its S-300 advanced air defense system and does not think they are needed, Vladimir Kozhin, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was quoted as saying on Friday in the Russian newspaper Izvestiya. Kozhin oversees military assistance to other countries.\nThe comments follow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Moscow this week, in which he presented to Putin \"Israel's obligation and right to defend itself against Iranian aggression, from Syrian territory.\"\nThe Syrian army has for years sought to obtain the S-300 system to counter Israeli air superiority, and Israel has in turn lobbied the Kremlin to refrain from supplying them. Iran received its first S-300 batteries in 2016, nearly a decade after Tehran paid for it.\nRussia last month hinted it would supply the weapons to Assad, over Israeli objections, after Western military strikes on Syria. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the strikes had removed any moral obligation Russia had to withhold the missiles and Russia's Kommersant daily cited unnamed military sources as saying deliveries might begin imminently.\nBut Kozhin's comments, made so soon after Netanyahu's Moscow talks with Putin, suggest the Israeli leader's hard lobbying efforts have, for the time being, paid off.\n\"For now, we're not talking about any deliveries of new modern [air defense] systems,\" Izvestia cited Kozhin as saying when asked about the possibility of supplying Syria with S-300s. The Syrian military already had \"everything it needed,\" Kozhin added.\nOn Thursday, Israel said it had attacked nearly all of Iran's military infrastructure in Syria after Iranian forces fired rockets at Israeli-held territory. S-300s could have significantly complicated the Israeli strikes.\nThe Israel Air Force said it destroyed five anti-aircraft batteries, all Russian-made models, in the attack.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:45:40Z","url":"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/russia-not-in-talks-with-syria-to-supply-s-300-system-1.6076063"}

He is the son of Dominic and Mary McGlinchey, two leaders of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) and was present at their murders in Drogheda and Dundalk in 1994 and 1987.\n“Republicanism is a very honourable thing if done in an honourable way. We shouldn’t be dishonouring it by the mindless use of violence,” Mr McGlinchey said in a wide-ranging interview with The Irish Times .\nSenior dissidents are facing trial while hundreds of others have been prosecuted by the PSNI and Garda in recent years. “I haven’t said to anybody pack up and go home . . . what I am saying is that we should not be bound by the weapons. Just because they are there does not mean that they have to be used”.\nIn further conversation yesterday, he deplored the Good Friday murder of former Continuity IRA commander Tommy Crossan in Belfast, while sardonically adding that the killing had “little to do with the armed struggle”.\nMr McGlinchey, with a name and a pedigree that carries weight in dissident circles, is the most senior such republican to raise these questions with dissidents.\nHe resigned from Sinn Féin in 2007 in protest at the decision to support policing. He was also named in court as being the getaway driver in the 2009 dissident attack on Massereene British army base in Antrim in which British soldiers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey were murdered. He was interviewed by the PSNI about the attack. He denied any involvement.\nHe also claimed that his father, who was shot dead six months before the groundbreaking IRA ceasefire of 1994, was killed “to facilitate the peace process”.\nThose responsible, he contended, were one of three groups: the IRA, British military intelligence or people acting for the Irish government. Mr McGlinchey’s comments about dissident republicans seriously considering ending their campaigns of violence come as the various groups face severe pressure from the PSNI, the Garda and MI5.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T05:56:55Z","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mcglinchey-urges-dissidents-to-consider-ending-armed-campaign-1.1769314"}

{"text":"A car called the Excel is to go on sale in the United States for the first time Thursday morning. It is an unremarkable looking vehicle, resembling many of the small, efficient Japanese cars that have wrested a large share of the market from the domestic Big Three.\nThe Excel, though, is not from Japan. It is being imported from Korea, where its manufacturer, the Hyundai Corporation, is one of the nation's leading manufacturing groups. The Hyundai Excel is the first of what could be a torrent of small cars made in Korea and other Asian countries headed for American shores.\nThe 1970's saw the rise of the Japanese, aided by two gasoline supply scares that shifted consumer demand to small cars with high fuel economy. Last year imports, the vast majority of them Japanese, claimed 23.8 percent of the American car market.\nMany Korean-made cars will arrive here bearing familiar domestic labels, as the American auto companies join industries such as shoes, textiles and consumer electronics in shifting production to developing nations to take advantage of low-cost labor. According to the United Automobile Workers union, wages and benefits for Korean auto workers average $2.16 an hour, compared with about $13 an hour in Japan and over $20 an hour in the United States.\nIn addition, Ford has an affiliate in Taiwan, Ford Lio Ho, that it says will produce a small car for sale in Canada within the next few years. The American Motors Corporation is assembling Jeep models with a Chinese partner in Peking, and A.M.C. officials are saying those vehicles may be shipped to the United States.\nHyundai clearly plans to use its labor cost advantage to help establish the brand name, pricing its bottom-of-the-line model at $4,995. But only 20 percent of its first-year sales will be of these stripped-down models. Most of the cars are expected to sell in the $5,500 to $6,500 range, still less than most comparably equipped Japanese or domestic models cost. And the increase in the value of the yen is putting upward pressure on Japanese car prices in this country.\nUnlike the Yugo, an even lower priced Yugoslavian-made car that made its debut in the American market in the fall, and has gotten some unfavorable reviews for its features and quality, the Hyundai Excel has been glowingly praised by the automotive press.\nHyundai sales will be limited by the capacity of its sole assembly plant to 100,000 shipments in the first year, but most auto analysts expect the cars to be sold as fast as they arrive. The new brand, which is not subject to any import restraints, was given an unintended boost by the Japanese Government, which extended restraints on exports by that country's car producers for another year.\nMost analysts and auto executives here expect the third world imports to eventually become an important factor in the American car market. Since demand is not expected to grow anywhere as quickly as supply, some existing producers are likely to lose market share, and possibly go out of business.\nHyundai officials say they have plans to bring in other, more expensive, car models into the American market if the Excel is successful.\nMichael Luckey, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said, ''They're talking about 5 percent of the market by 1990.'' Five percent of an 11 million car market would be 550,000 units, or about what the No. 2 importer, the Nissan Motor Company, sold last year. The Toyota Motor Corporation is No. 1.\nOne reason Hyundai has been able to beat its Korean competitors to the American market is its ties to the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan. Mitsubishi provided the technology for the Excel's front-wheel-drive engine and transmission. In return, Mitsubishi will sell 30,000 of the 100,000 Excels bound for America.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T08:23:10Z","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/business/korea-s-4995-excel-enters-us-auto-fray.html"}
{"text":"As India bans foreign surrogacy, clinics look towards Cambodia, but what will it mean for the rights of surrogates?\nNew Delhi, India - Rita* tucks hungrily into a plate of steaming white rice, daal (lentils), a mixed-vegetable curry, yoghurt and a green salad.\nHer just-washed hair is gathered at the nape of her neck in a loose bun and the bold, flower print of her tunic stretches out over her heavily pregnant belly. She sits cross-legged on the bed in her sunny room in the yellow surrogate house, just off the main road on the outskirts of Gurgaon, a hub of domestic and international businesses and sparkling malls and eateries bordering New Delhi.\nRita is one of the last surrogates in India carrying a child for a foreign couple. In October last year, when Rita was around five months pregnant, the Indian Council for Medical Research sent a notification (PDF) to all fertility clinics, ordering them \"not to entertain any foreigners for availing surrogacy services in India\".\nEarlier, in a written affidavit to the Supreme Court, the Indian government had confirmed it \"does not support commercial surrogacy\" and that the new law will have provisions to \"prohibit and penalise commercial surrogacy services\".\nAn Asian Age report says that as the government finds it a \"contentious\" issue, addressing it \"is the need of the hour\".\nIndia has been criticised for its failure to regulate its surrogacy industry and seems determined to address surrogacy as a standalone issue: the much-discussed Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, drafted in 2007 by the then Congress government, of which surrogacy was a part, has now been been narrowed down to deal with just surrogacy and will be renamed the Surrogacy Regulation Bill.\nIt is at present being discussed by a group of ministers headed by union health minister J P Nadda.\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research directive followed the release of draft legislation by India's health ministry prohibiting foreigners - except those with family origins in India - from employing Indian surrogates.\nThe new law is in its final stages and is expected to be passed soon, outlawing foreign surrogacy with the aim of protecting the rights of surrogate mothers.\nFacing losses in what was a lucrative trade - India's surrogacy industry is estimated to be worth around $500m per year - Indian clinics have started moving out to Cambodia, a country with ambiguous surrogacy laws and a visa-on-arrival facility for Indian nationals. More than a dozen Thai and Indian clinics are already operating there.\n\"I am aware of a few Indian and Nepali clinics that have set up in Cambodia,\" says Sam Everingham, director of events and content for the Australia-based Families through Surrogacy. \"The surrogates come from Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. Some may also come from India - that's not clear yet.\"\nNon-Indian surrogates often charge anything from $15,000 upwards, and in the US, for example, where commercial surrogacy is allowed only in certain states, it can cost upwards of $150,000. In India, however, the costs are often well under $30,000.\n\"Prospective parents won't want to pay that amount, especially for a country where surrogacy laws are ambiguous,\" says Nepal-based Preeti Bista, cofounder of My Fertility Angel Cambodia.\nThese clinics will undoubtedly begin hiring Indian surrogates in Cambodia, Bista believes, simply because \"they are cheaper\".\nAnd some surrogates do not seem averse to this. Hundreds of them had protested against the ban outside the ICMR offices when the ruling was passed.\n\"I was struggling to pay off a debt of $8,000,\" Rita says. \"I left my home for nine months to stay in a new place. I am grateful I didn't have to travel, but I wouldn't mind if I had to.\"\nThat desperation isn't only shared by the surrogate mothers and their families. Surrogacy in India is also the last resort for many infertile couples in countries where surrogacy is either banned or prohibitively expensive.\n\"The difference between surrogacy costs in India and the US for most infertile couples is the difference between having the option to have a child or not,\" says New York-based hotelier Arnon Magal, who struggled with infertility for years and sought alternatives, including IVF treatments in Israel and Cyprus and two failed surrogacy pregnancies in India. He was hoping to again hire a surrogate in India this year.\nBut the ban comes after years of controversies that have plagued the industry, including accusations by rights groups of exploitation of surrogate mothers.\nBut Mark Henaghan, a New Zealand-based law professor, who follows the issue closely, believes that outlawing international surrogacy will only lead to more abuse of the surrogates.\n\"It is unlikely that the entire industry will cease now that it has been banned. It seems more likely that a black market or underground industry will spring up in its place, which will afford much less protection for everyone involved, especially the surrogates and the resulting children,\" says Henaghan.\nThis was the result when, in 2012, India banned single and gay-couple surrogacy. Neighbouring Nepal, which allowed surrogacy as long as the surrogate was not a Nepalese citizen, emerged as an offshore surrogacy hub with Indian clinics impregnating and then smuggling Indian surrogates across the border into Nepal for deliveries - a foreign country where the mothers' rights were not clearly defined.\nIt all came to a head in April last year when a massive earthquake hit Nepal and many Indian surrogates were stranded as Israel airlifted its own citizens and their babies, leaving the surrogates stranded in a quake-ravaged country. The country suspended commercial surrogacy the following August.\nBista was a coordinator for an international fertility agency that worked through an Indian clinic when the Nepal earthquake hit. She says they had to send surrogate mothers who were mid-term in their pregnancies back to India, while some others stayed behind in temporary shelters in Nepal to wait out their pregnancies.\n\"That was horrible,\" she says.\n\"Even before the earthquake, there were agencies in Nepal who kept surrogates in overcrowded surrogate houses with 10 or so in a room. Some of them had their children and husbands with them. There was no work for the husbands and it was a very harassing situation for them,\" she continues.\n\"I wouldn't deny it won't happen in Cambodia. The only way out is to regulate. When governments ban, people find other locations to continue. And in fact such bans make the surrogates more vulnerable in a third country,\" Bista says.\nInvestigations by various journalists and rights groups into the lives of surrogate mothers revealed mistreatment in the surrogate houses, a lack of nutritious food and poor hygiene. The surrogates were also often emotionally distressed.\n\"Most of the women said they are happy but their answers seemed rehearsed to me,\" says Janak Sapkota, a local journalist who covered the issue in the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake. \"They missed home, their families and their villages.\"\nEveringham, of Families through Surrogacy, visited Cambodia last year to assess the situation and found it far from ideal.\n\"There is no legislation protecting the rights of the surrogate, child or intended parents,\" he says. \"The ban [in India] will push intended parents to engage in far riskier places like Cambodia, where there is a serious lack of medical support services, such as neonatal care units.\"\n\"There is a strong demand for surrogacy and for people to use surrogates to have their genetic child,\" Henaghan says.\n\"Where there is demand, it will always find a market.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-26T08:06:54Z","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/nepal-indian-surrogacy-clinics-move-cambodia-160614112517994.html"}

The celebration dates back thousands of years to pagan spring and fertility rites. Over time, Christianity incorporated popular traditions, and the excess and debauchery of the Mardi Gras season eventually became a prelude to Lent.\nThis year, Fat Tuesday falls on March 5.\nAcadiana has become known as the family friendly alternative to New Orleans Mardi Gras — drawing crowds of more than 300,000 from around the nation and the world.\nSo, if you are new to the area or one of thousands of visitors, welcome. Consider us your guide to all things Mardi Gras.\nLafayette's Mardi Gras parades begin dowtown at the junction of Simcoe, Surrey and Jefferson streets. The three-mile route winds through downtown and down Johnston to College, ending at Cajun Field.\nIn Lafayette, parade season traditionally kicks off with is the Krewe of Rio. This year, Rio will be pre-empted by Lafayette's first walking parade, the Krewe des Canailles, which takes place on Friday, Feb. 22.\nIn the society world, Mardi Gras is like the World Series of social events. Only it takes place over many, many weeks. The gowns, the tuxes, the royalty, the pageants — local Mardi Gras krewes prepare all year for their ball. They are grand affairs that follow time-honored traditions. Even if you don't belong to a krewe or you weren't lucky enough to get a ball invitation, you may want to consult the schedule. Traffic around party venues can be a bear during Mardi Gras.\nQUIZ: How much do you know about Lafayette's krewes?\nIn many areas, king cake is associated with the festival of Epiphany at the end of the Christmas season. In South Louisiana, it is synonymous with Mardi Gras.\nLike a traditional French king cake made of puff pastry and marzipan? Prefer a king cake that's braided, filled and fried up like a doughnut? How about a whole-wheat or a gluten-free one? In Acadiana, the king cake options are plenty.\nIn Cajun Country, Mardi Gras isn't just an event, it describes those dressed in rags and masks who — traditionally — go door to door for community feast ingredients.\nThe Courir de Mardi Gras, held in many small towns around Acadiana, features costumed men and women on horseback and trucks who travel the countryside to beg neighbors for ingredients to a gumbo, usually with a musical band and onlookers following behind. Once they back in town, a communal gumbo is traditionally cooked and enjoyed, sometimes accompanied by a fais do-do or community dance.\nYou can experience courirs in such communities as Church Point and Mamou.

{"text":"The European Commission wants new powers to oversee the way new cars are approved before they are sold, but it has never used a key scrutinising power it has had for more than eight years, the EUobserver has learned.\nUnder current rules, the commission can ask a member state to submit assessments of the test facilities that carry out certification tasks including emissions testing.\nBut this website learned from a freedom of information request that the commission has never asked for such a report, raising questions about its proposal in January that it should be given more powers.\nIn order to be allowed to sell a car on the European market, manufacturers need to obtain a certificate, a so-called type approval.\nThese are handed out by national authorities like the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) in the UK or the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) in Germany.\nHowever, most of the authorities outsource the actual testing to private companies.\nThese companies, designated as so-called technical services, have come under scrutiny in the past nine months since it emerged that they had been unable to detect Volkswagen Group (VW) using software to fool the emissions test.\nSince these companies are paid directly by car makers, critics of the system are worried there is a conflict of interest.\nAccording to a 2007 directive, national governments are in charge of making sure that the technical services have the proper skills and technical knowledge to do their job.\nThe directive required member states to demonstrate those skills by providing an assessment report, at least once every three years.\n“The assessment report shall be communicated to the commission upon request,” the legislation said.\nThis website filed a freedom of information request with the commission on 12 April, and asked for all assessment reports the commission had so far received.\nOn Monday (30 May), the commission told this website that it never had received such documents.\n“We regret to inform you that no documents were found that would correspond to the description given in your application,” the commission's directorate for industry said in a letter.\nThat's because the commission never asked for them.\n\"We have not had reason to question the technical capability of technical services,\" EU commission spokeswoman Lucia Caudet told this website.\n\"Our focus is on improving the testing methodology and the independence of testing.\n\"We are introducing robust tests to measure emissions in real driving conditions, and will keep refining and reviewing the tests to ensure the strictest emissions limits are really met.\n\"We have also tabled a full overhaul of the type approval system, including proposals to avoid potential conflicts of interest of technical services, more stringent performance criteria, and regular and independent audits.\"\nIf the proposal, which needs approval from member states and the EU parliament, is adopted, the commission would be granted the power “to suspend, restrict or withdraw the designation of technical services that are under-performing and too lax in applying the rules”.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T10:05:20Z","url":"https://euobserver.com/dieselgate/133611"}
{"text":"It’s been almost eight years since the last recession ended in June 2009, Steve Rick, CUNA Mutual Group chief economist, explained in an interview with HousingWire.\nWith economists predicting the next two years won’t bring a recession, that could put the economy on track for its longest period without a recession in modern history, Rick explained.\nIn fact, he explained that there are no major imbalances in the market at this point that could bring on a recession.\nThis week, the ADP National Employment Report predicted strong growth for January with the highest increase in jobs since June 2016. It’s predicted increase of 246,000 is significantly higher than previous months.\nRick’s forecast for Friday’s jobs report is a bit more modest at 225,000 jobs, but still significantly above the last several months. He explained that the jump in business optimism since the election of President Donald Trump pushed many employers to create new jobs.\nIn fact, Trump’s stimulus plans could even push the economy to 3% inflation, instead of the anticipated 2%, Rick said.\nEarlier this week, the Federal Open Market Committee opted not to raise rates during its first meeting of the year, confirming economists’ expectations that they will take a more “wait and see” approach.\nHowever, that was only the first of eight scheduled meetings for 2017.\nBut another economist insisted that even the projected three rate hikes is too many. Jason Obradovich, New American Funding executive vice president of capital markets, explained in an interview with HousingWire that for all its intentions, the Fed probably won’t be raising rates as much as it would like in 2017.\nIf the Fed does raise rates too fast, Rick explained that could bring an economic slowdown, or even a recession.\nFor now, however, the economy is currently enjoying its third longest period without a recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The longest period was 10 years in the 1990s and the second was just under nine years in the 1960s.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T21:56:34Z","url":"https://www.housingwire.com/articles/39120-years-and-counting-economy-could-set-record-with-no-recession-in-sight"}

{"text":"We learned last week that the radio show Brian Ward and I host on AM 1280 the Patriot is coming to an end. The station has sold our 12-1 hour on Saturdays to someone who is willing to pay for the privilege of broadcasting. They are working on selling the 11-12 hour and expect to do so within the next few weeks. Apparently the amount the station can command by filling the time slot with infomercials exceeds the advertising revenue for our show, even though our ratings have been good. Very good, if you take into account our zero budget and the station’s erratic signal, and add those who listen on the internet.\nBut that’s how it goes. Our relationship with WWTC has always been a marriage of convenience; no money ever changed hands. Because they didn’t pay us, the station never told us what to do. It’s been a remarkable thing, over the last five or six years, to be able to commandeer a radio station for two hours a week to do whatever we wanted. I’ve often said that everyone should have a radio show.\nThere is a great deal I will miss about being on the Patriot. Because of our involvement in local politics and connections made through this web site (along with a certain amount of chutzpah on our part) a remarkable succession of guests appeared on our program. The opportunity to interview authors, politicians and others was great, and I often podcasted those interviews as well. I will, of course, miss our annual appearances at the Minnesota State Fair.\nThe 12-1 hour is already gone, but this morning I will do a farewell show from 11 to 12, central time. Brian is too brokenhearted (or ticked off at the Patriot, I’m not sure which) to appear, but I will do a one-hour show to say goodbye to our listeners and leave them with some final thoughts.\nThere is an outside chance that the show might be reincarnated on another station. Most likely, though, it will be time to turn the page on this aspect of our civic involvement.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T08:33:27Z","url":"https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2011/01/028042.php"}
{"text":"NEW DELHI: Over fifteen years after the Concorde — the world’s first and only supersonic aircraft to be used commercially — retired, US aerospace major Boeing has announced it is working on the next-gen aircraft that will be able to go faster than the speed of sound.\nBoeing has partnered with an American company, Aerion Supersonic, to build a business jet AS2 that can go upto Mach 1.4 or about 1,600 mph — that is up to 70% faster than today’s business jets. The AS2 will save about three hours on a trans-Atlantic flight and is slated for first flight in 2023.\nBoeing announced Tuesday Aerion’s AS2 will be the first supersonic business jet to market, with the aircraft major providing financial, engineering and industrial resources. “As part of the agreement, Boeing made a significant investment in Aerion to accelerate technology development and aircraft design, and unlock supersonic air travel for new markets… Boeing will provide engineering, manufacturing and flight test resources, as well as strategic vertical content, to bring Aerion’s AS2 supersonic business jet to market,” Boeing said in a statement.\n“Boeing is leading a mobility transformation that will safely and efficiently connect the world faster than ever before. This is a strategic and disciplined leading-edge investment in further maturing supersonic technology. Through this partnership that combines Aerion’s supersonic expertise with Boeing’s global industrial scale and commercial aviation experience, we have the right team to build the future of sustainable supersonic flight,” said Steve Nordlund, VP and GM of Boeing NeXT. Boeing NeXt is working on a “new mobility ecosystem” that include autonomous air vehicles and passenger-carrying hypersonic aircraft.\nFounded in 2003 to develop new, more efficient aerodynamic technologies for supersonic aircraft, Aerion introduced its AS2 12-passenger business jet design in 2014. The company unveiled the AS2’s GE Affinity engine design in 2018.\n“Aerion is the industry leader mapping out a successful, sustainable return to supersonic flight. The AS2 is the launch point for the future of regulatory-compliant and efficient supersonic flight. Together with Boeing, we’re creating a faster, more connected future with tremendous possibilities for enhancing humanity’s productivity and potential,” said Tom Vice, chairman, president and CEO of Aerion.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T00:19:32Z","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/boeing-ties-up-with-aerion-to-develop-supersonic-aircraft/articleshow/67865328.cms"}

The ceremony, sponsored by The Islamic Society-Jabalyia (ISJ) and Viva Palestina-Malaysia, was attended by dozens of activists at the prisoners’ tent at the Square of the Unknown Soldier in Gaza City.\n\"This event takes place in order to support Palestinian political prisoners in their struggle for their inalienable human rights. A year ago, CPDS announced a creative writing contest to promote prisoners rights. We received more than 20 submissions by activists from different countries. This competition is to encourage people to keep telling the story of Palestinians’ suffering. Today we are celebrating those activists and encouraging other young writers who can convey the message of those who sacrificed their happiness, families and future to defend our collective rights as Palestinians,\" said Dr Mahmoud Alhirthani, CPDS chairman.\n\"Without the support of different bodies, this effort would not have succeeded. Thanks to the Islamic Society in Jabalia and thanks to Viva Palestina Malaysia, who help CPDS and provide us with the support necessary to stand by the prisoners. This support is enabling an Arabic opera to be subtitled in English and a number of reports on the prisoners to be translated into English,\" he added.\nThe event, the first of its kind in Gaza, was attended by ex-prisoner Chris Bandak, who was freed in the last swap which took place in October 2011 and deported to Gaza. In his speech, Bandak highlighted the importance of supporting prisoners.\n\"Palestinian prisoners expect us to stand by them.

{"text":"France was stepping up efforts on Monday to persuade world powers to impose a no-fly zone over Libya, as Muammar Gaddafi’s troops battled rebel fighters for control of the strategic oil town of Brega.\nFrance said on Sunday it would consult other powers “in the coming hours” to try to set up such a zone to assure the protection of civilians “in the face of the terrible violence suffered by the Libyan population”.\nIt said the Arab League’s weekend call on the United Nations to impose such a zone showed the world’s concern for Libyan civilians.\nArab support satisfies one of three conditions set by Nato for it to police Libyan air space. The others were proof that its help was needed, and a UN Security Council resolution.\nOn the ground, government troops advancing east took Brega early on Sunday in what looked like an increasingly confident drive towards the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.\nHowever, the rebels, inspired by the overthrow of the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents to try to end Gaddafi’s four-decade rule, said they had re-taken Brega on Sunday night. There was no way of verifying the rival claims.\nThe government, whose forces had previously captured Ras Lanuf, another oil town 100km west of Brega, said earlier it was certain of victory and threatened to “bury” the rebels, whom it linked to al-Qaeda and “foreign security services”.\nGaddafi himself met the Russian, Chinese and Indian ambassadors and urged their countries to invest in Libya’s oil sector, badly disrupted by the uprising and the flight of tens of thousands of expatriates oil workers.\nLibyan oil exports have been badly disrupted by the fighting, lack of staff, international sanctions and the refusal of international banks to fund trade deals.\nSome experts say it may take a year for output to recover to its previous level of about 1,6-million barrels per day.\nInternational crude prices fell by about $1 a barrel on Gaddafi regaining territory over the weekend.\nAt the United Nations, a diplomat told Reuters the Security Council would hold consultations on a no-fly zone on Monday.\nRussia and China, diplomats said, would have difficulty vetoing authorisation for a no-fly when the Arab League had requested it.\nEnvoys said Moscow and Beijing might prefer to abstain when the issue came to a vote.\nFrance hosts a Group of Eight foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday and said they would discuss the violence in Libya.\nThe Libyan government said it would welcome an African Union panel to try to help resolve the crisis, but condemned the Arab League call for a no-fly zone, describing it as “a dangerous act for Arab security that only serves the Zionist enemy”.\nTime, however, is short for ill-equipped rebels facing far superior firepower, including warplanes and helicopters.\nA Libyan government army source told state television on Sunday: “Brega has been cleansed of armed gangs,” and rebel fighters retreating eastwards were demoralised.\nBrega is 220km south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and Ajdabiyah is the only sizeable town between them.\nThe flat desert terrain means the government’s aircraft and tanks outweigh the rebels’ enthusiasm and light weaponry, except in towns where the odds against the rebels are reduced.\nState television carried a confident official message. “We are certain of our victory, whatever the price,” it said.\n“Those acts of division will be buried together with those who committed them, who are linked to foreign security services and the terrorist organisation al Qaeda,” it said.\nLate on Sunday, rebel media officer Mustafa Gheriani told reporters in Benghazi the rebels had retaken Brega, killed 25 Gaddafi fighters and taken 20 prisoners.\nThe Libyan conflict has escalated from a popular uprising similar to protests that toppled the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt and have shaken other countries in the region. It is now more akin to a civil war.\nProtests in the capital had stopped.\nFresh from crushing the revolt in Zawiyah, west of Tripoli, elite government troops and tanks turned to Misrata, Libya’s third biggest city with 300 000 people and the only pocket of rebel resistance outside the east.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T06:32:26Z","url":"https://mg.co.za/article/2011-03-14-france-steps-up-efforts-for-libya-nofly-zone"}

{"text":"Colorado legislators have narrowly voted in a bill that would establish state-run financial services for marijuana sellers, in an effort to ease the cash-only burden afflicting commercial weed distributors.\nThe bill, which is pending approval from Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and then the Federal Reserve, would set up \"cannabis credit co-ops\" throughout the state. Because the sale of marijuana is still federally illegal, Colorado's pot sellers have found it difficult to find national banks willing to offer financial services for their businesses. This, according to Representative John Singer, has made marijuana businesses targets for criminals (with so much cash lying around) and hindered the state's ability to track revenues for tax purpose. Singer, the proposal's main backer, said that the co-ops would be \"the final piece to our pot puzzle.\"\nThe vote was the ultimate compromise for legislators who wanted to keep the cooperatives limited to marijuana businesses. But industrial hemp farmers had voiced problems about accessing banking services, specifically with co-mingling loans on crops such as wheat and corn with hemp. \"Two farmers with lines of credit were threatened, one told outright that if he grew hemp, the bank would terminate his line of credit,\" said Samantha Walsh of the Rocky Mountain Hemp Association.\nThe co-ops would be a step towards ameliorating what Attorney General Eric Holder referred to as a public safety problem. He said in January that \"Huge amounts of cash, substantial amounts of cash, just kind of lying around with no place for it to appropriately deposited is something that would worry me from just a law enforcement perspective.\"\nRepresentatives from Hickenlooper's office said that he will sign the bill. However, it still might not solve anything, as it's likely to be ultimately blocked by the Federal Reserve, because there's no provision for deposit insurance, which is required by other banks.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T04:11:46Z","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/05/banking-co-op-for-weed-sellers-approved-in-colorado/361915/"}

{"text":"On Nov. 2, when “Bohemian Rhapsody” — the biopic of Freddie Mercury, lead singer of British rock group Queen — debuts on U.S. screens, it will mark latest in a long string of highly diverse films lensed by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel.\nThe DP’s work, which goes back to the early ’80s, has encompassed war stories (“Three Kings”), dark comedy (“Confessions of a Dangerous Mind”), historical drama (“Marshall”), TV movies and series, multiple documentaries — and the genre for which he is perhaps best known – superhero movies, including “Superman Returns” and four installments of the X-Men franchise.\nSigel was attracted to visual art from a young age, and at first honed his skills as a painter. He experimented with abstraction, but always came back to more representational imagery that served a narrative. He arrived in New York City from Detroit at age 18, having been invited to the Whitney Museum’s artist-in-residence fellowship program.\nSigel soon began making personal films and, given the political turmoil of the time, he gravitated to documentaries with social topics. Soon he was travelling to the world’s hot spots with a camera, especially Central America. He shot a documentary that showed U.S. audiences the first images of the Contras’ secret militia in Nicaragua.\nHis work came to the attention of master cinematographer, director and activist Haskell Wexler, who needed a DP for what became “Latino,” a 1985 film set against Ronald Reagan’s proxy war against the Nicaraguan government. “What drew me into narrative and feature filmmaking was the desire to control the visual storytelling more than you can with photojournalism,” Sigel says.\nDespite his subsequent foray into indie and studio features, Sigel’s name still comes up among cinematographers as an under-the-radar trendsetter whose films are considered game-changers – “Drive” and “Three Kings” being the most often cited.\n“Three Kings,” directed by David O. Russell in 1999, took a bold, even risky approach to color, contrast, film stocks and lab processes that is still influential. “Drive,” directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, used the then-new Arri Alexa digital camera.\nAlong the way, Sigel has forged working relationships with numerous directors, working most often with Bryan Singer. The forthcoming “Bohemian Rhapsody” will be their 12th narrative project together.\nThe visual artist and social documentary aspects of Sigel’s mindset still have a strong impact on his choices. Director Reginald Hudlin worked with Sigel on “Marshall,” last year’s biopic about the first African-American Supreme Court Justice.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T22:20:18Z","url":"https://variety.com/2018/artisans/spotlight/queen-freddie-mercury-1202984921/"}
{"text":"Is Agunah Tamar Epstein's Remarriage Legal Without Orthodox Divorce?\nEpstein, who has conducted a high-profile, years-long campaign to force her recalcitrant ex-husband to grant her a religious bill of divorce, appeared recently to have found a way around her dilemma.\nTamar Epstein, the prominent “chained woman” whose right to remarry under traditional Jewish law was long stymied, may have finally found two Orthodox rabbis willing to help her wed again. But her fate in the broader Jewish community — and the fate of any children she may have — is anything but ensured.\nEpstein, who has conducted a high-profile, years-long campaign to force her recalcitrant ex-husband, a Capitol Hill congressional aide, to grant her a religious bill of divorce, appeared recently to have found a way around her dilemma. Traditional Jewish law bars a woman from remarrying without first receiving such a bill of divorce, even if, like Epstein, she is already civilly divorced. But on September 24, Epstein was wed to her new husband by a prominent rabbi in Memphis, Tennessee, after an unnamed Philadelphia Orthodox rabbi used a rare procedure to annul Epstein’s earlier marriage.\nThis seemed to end the 33-year-old’s status as an agunah, as such women are known in Hebrew — a term commonly translated into English as “chained woman.” But this was not necessarily the happy ending that many had hoped she would get.\nThe decision to allow Epstein to remarry ignited a firestorm within the Orthodox community. Opponents of the decision are making it clear that Epstein and any future children she may have will not find acceptance in the Orthodox community of which she considers herself a part.\n“The woman is considered married for all purposes and is forbidden for any other man until a religious court rules otherwise,” Rabbi Aharon Feldman, head of Baltimore’s Ner Israel Rabbinical College, wrote in an open letter he addressed to fellow rabbis and religious leaders. “In the meanwhile, she must leave her second ‘husband,’ and if she has children, they will be considered bastards until relieved by a religious court.” Under traditional Jewish law, children classified as bastards — mamzerim in Hebrew — are not allowed to marry other Jews who are born to women considered to be legitimately married.\nEpstein has long become the face of the struggle of chained women in America. A resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, she married Aharon Friedman in 2006; the couple’s only daughter was born a year later. In 2010 she and Friedman decided to separate; they got a civil divorce, but Friedman refused to provide his wife with a get, a religious bill of divorce, which is required under Jewish law to release the wife from the marriage. Epstein thus became an agunah, unable to remarry until her estranged husband grants her the religious divorce.\nEpstein’s plight touched the hearts of many in the metropolitan Washington Orthodox community and led to a series of articles condemning Friedman. Her sympathizers held routine demonstrations outside Capitol Hill, where Friedman works as a congressional staff aide to Rep. Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican. Several area Orthodox synagogues decided to boycott Friedman, not allowing him to pray with the congregation until he signs his wife’s get. But despite the protests, Friedman has refused to grant the religious divorce, reportedly in an attempt to use the refusal to leverage his request for changing visiting rights of the couple’s daughter in his favor.\nSome rabbinical authorities view the breakthrough that allowed Epstein to remarry as a creative solution. But others condemn it as a violation of Jewish law.\nThe breakthrough came earlier this fall, when a rabbinic authority in Philadelphia issued a heter, or permission, that annulled Epstein’s marriage based on the claim that Friedman was mentally ill at the time the couple married. The identity of this rabbinical authority was not disclosed, but according to several ultra-Orthodox websites it was likely to have been Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky, head of the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia. In the past, Kamenetsky has worked to resolve Epstein’s situation.\nAlthough the unnamed rabbinical authority was not provided with any professional mental evaluation of Friedman’s condition, the rabbi ruled that had Epstein known of these mental issues in advance, she would never have married Friedman, and therefore the marriage is annulled and Epstein is free to remarry. Annulment, while existing in traditional Jewish law, is a very rare procedure, and according to a source in the Orthodox community, it has never been used in modern times.\nEpstein’s marriage to Adam Fleischer in a traditional Jewish ceremony in Memphis was officiated by Rabbi Nota Greenblatt, who is the head of the city’s Orthodox umbrella organization, Vaad Hakehilloth, and is a well known halachic authority.\nThe controversy that ensued centered on interpretation of religious law rather than on Epstein’s right to be released from her husband. Even those critical of the unusual halachic procedure were, for the most part, sympathetic to Epstein’s plight. They reiterated their call for Friedman to issue a religious divorce.\nAll parties involved declined to discuss the permission given to Epstein for her subsequent marriage, stating it was a private, personal issue.\nAdvocates of women’s rights under Jewish law were also cautious about the broader implications of this ruling. “There is a concept of annulment in Jewish law that can be applied in some cases, but I am neutral on this topic,” said Rabbi Jeremy Stern, executive director of the Organization for the Resolution of Agunot, an organization established to help chained women be set free. Stern said his group focuses on the need for divorced men to provide their ex-wives with a get.\nMany rabbis argue that Epstein’s resort to what they view as a questionable procedure is inconsistent with Jewish law and will do nothing to solve the problem.\n“It is clear at this point that Tamar Epstein is still married to Aharon Friedman — because the heter she received to remarry is a sad joke based on a clear corruption and misuse of halachic principles,” wrote Rabbi Dovid Eidensohn, one of the ultra-Orthodox community’s leading voices on issues of marriage.\nFurthermore, rabbis who oppose the move are now working to sign up as many rabbinical voices as possible in the Orthodox community, to ensure that, in the future, the community does not accept Epstein’s annulment and the use of the practice.\n“Until now, there were a few attempts” by rabbis to annul marriages, Feldman wrote. But they changed nothing, “because the protest of our rabbis silenced them.” But this time is different. “Now, this permission is coming from an important and significant rabbi, and if we do not protest, our pact will come apart,” Feldman warned.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T20:37:37Z","url":"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/agunah-tamar-epstein-to-remarry-is-it-legal-1.5430040"}
{"text":"The Maryland teenager who terrorized his high school used his father's handgun to shoot a girl he'd just broken up with and another classmate, investigators said Wednesday.\nAustin Wyatt Rollins, 17, was later killed when he traded shots with the school resource officer at Great Mills High School, they said.\n\"Rollins and the female victim had a prior relationship that recently ended,\" the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. \"The handgun utilized by Rollins in the shooting was legally owned by Rollins' father.\"\nRollins' alleged target, 16-year-old Jaelynn Willey, remains in critical condition at a local hospital. But a 14-year-old boy who happened to be in a hallway when Rollins opened fire was released after being treated for a gunshot wound to the leg.\nIt was not clear how the teenager, who lived in Lexington Park, Maryland, got hold of his father's weapon or what make or caliber it is.\nThe Maryland shooting happened as a national debate is underway on how best to protect students from gun-toting attackers. It was rekindled by the Valentine’s Day massacre of 17 students and staffers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\nThe quick response of St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Deputy Blaine Gaskill, who had been assigned to the school last year, stands in stark contrast to that of Parkland school safety officer Scot Peterson, who resigned amid reports that he went AWOL when the shooting started.\nThe National Rifle Association has been quick to point to Gaskill as proof that armed guards and teachers are a better deterrent than gun control. But Gaskill faced a teenager armed with a handgun, not a rifle like the Parkland shooter.\nNevetheless, what Gaskill is reported to have done is extremely rare.\nThe Washington Post, which has done an analysis of dozens of school shootings, reported Wednesday that Gaskill would only be the second school resource officer to kill an active shooter since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.\nIn the aftermath of the Parkland mass killing, President Donald Trump has called for arming teachers — an idea praised by the NRA and dismissed as a “colossally stupid idea” by many educators and school safety advocates.\nStill, Florida Gov. Rick Scott last month inked a new law that defied the NRA by raising the age to buy all firearms to 21 and imposed other gun-buying restrictions — but also allowed trained school workers and teachers to arm themselves.\nMeanwhile, Gaskill got a shout out Wednesday from Stephen Willeford, who was praised in November after he fatally shot the gunman who'd killed 26 people at a Texas church in Sutherland Springs.\nIn a telephone interview with NBC News, Willeford said he would “be honored to shake the hand\" of Gaskill.\n“He’s another good guy with a gun,” he said, repeating a phrase that is part of the NRA's mantra about armed citizens being the only thing \"that can stop a bad guy with a gun.\"\nWilleford is not likely to get any argument on the good guy part from Gaskill’s boss, Sheriff Tim Cameron, or Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Both have praised the 34-year-old “tough guy” for putting his own life on the line Tuesday.\n“While it’s still tragic, he may have saved other people’s lives,” Hogan said of Gaskill in the aftermath of Tuesday’s shooting.\nGaskill has yet to make a public statement.\nWilleford's brush with fame came after he pursued Texas church shooter Devin Patrick Kelly and shot him dead. He used a rifle similar to the Ruger AR-556 that Kelley used to commit the massacre.\nIt was later revealed that Willeford was a longtime NRA gun instructor — so the powerful gun lobby, which has been fighting attempts to ban such weapons, was quick to dub him as their kind of hero.\nThey did the same for Gaskill on Tuesday.\nWilleford, who recently was the guest of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Tex., at the State of the Union address in January, has done only sporadic interview since the Nov. 5 tragedy that pulled him from obscurity.\nHis lawyer, Pamela Thompson of San Antonio, said that’s mostly been by design.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T06:22:21Z","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/good-guy-gun-hails-another-stopping-maryland-school-shooter-n858766"}

{"text":"Michelle Morris was surprised when her mom handed her the May 24th issue of Sports Illustrated and she saw her name and face staring back at her with a small write-up.\nSports Illustrated included Morris in a \"Faces in the Crowd\" segment. The item chronicled how the La Cañada High graduate propelled the University of Georgia to win the NCAA Varsity Equestrian National Championship during a sudden-death ride-off.\n\"It's always our goal to get to that point and win the national championship,\" Morris said. \"It was the most intense thing I have ever been through in my entire life. It was so exciting and a great way to end it, obviously.\"\nWhen Morris was told she would be riding in the sudden-death ride-off to help the Georgia Bulldogs to a possible win in the national championship, she showed poise and came through, said Meghan Boenig, Morris' coach at Georgia.\n\"I'm sure she was panicking somewhere, but she never showed it,\" Boenig said. \"She was able to go out there and beat her opponent by 30 points, which gave Texas A&M no chance to come back. It gave our whole team a huge breath.\"\nSomehow it got even better for Morris. Not only was she a part of a championship-winning team, but she also won the individual title in the event.\n\"The individual was actually really unexpected,\" Morris said. \"It was something I knew was possible throughout the year, but it wasn't one of my main goals because it's almost as if you think about it — it doesn't happen. You just have to keep being consistent throughout the year.\"\nThis all sounds like the perfect ending to a dramatic senior season, but it's not. Morris, who turned 21 on June 20, was only a sophomore, and has two more years at Georgia.\nMorris began her involvement in the sport by chance. While running errands with her mom, a 7-year old Morris spied a flier for a horse-riding camp, which ended up sparking her equestrian career. After attending the camp she told her mother she wanted to take riding lessons, and her interest evolved from there.\nSoon, Morris was with a trainer in Chatsworth and at 13 she began training with Karen Healy in Thousand Oaks, who she still works with today. Healy's training reinforces the basics of riding and was influential in getting her experience in shows, Morris said.\nThat is important at the college level because Morris is always riding a different horse. Often, she has to focus so much on controlling different horses with different personalities and tendencies that she has little time to worry about her skills. The experience Healy has given Morris has proven priceless.\n\"I remember [Healy] telling my parents, 'the more you get into the show ring, the less the nerves are going to be and it will just become second nature,' \" Morris said. \"Training with her has helped me out a lot with that.\"\nMorris graduated from La Cañada in 2008 and was a member of the Interscholastic Equestrian League. It was through her participation in IEL that she decided to ride in college because the team-aspect appealed to her.\nAfter deciding she wanted to ride in college during her junior year, Morris prepared a recruiting tape and sent it to the four big riding schools in the NCAA: Georgia, the University of South Carolina, Auburn and Texas A&M. NCAA rules state coaches cannot contact players until July 1 before their senior year in high school.\n\"Literally, that day, July 1, the coach from Georgia called me and said she loved my tape and invited me to come out for a recruiting visit,\" Morris said.\nDuring her recruiting visit, Morris saw all that Georgia had to offer, and it was everything she wanted in a school: a big campus, an elite football program in the South East Conference and a great telecommunications program. The Bulldogs made Morris a great scholarship offer and she signed her letter of intent.\n\"I am so happy with my decision,\" Morris said. \"It is everything I wanted in a college experience.\"\nGeorgia and Boenig are also happy with her decision, as she was named the Most Valuable Player of her team in 2010.\nNot only is Morris a great rider for the Bulldogs, who knows how to push the envelope and impress the judges, but she is a leader as well, Boenig said. She works with the program's freshmen to let them know what to expect during practices and shows.\n\"[Morris] is a technician out there,\" Boenig said. \"She knows exactly how to get a little bit more out of each maneuver and has an incredible feel for whatever horse she is riding. She can get more out of any horse than other riders.\"\nNow the question is: How does Morris improve on her sophomore season where she won nearly every major award available to her?\n\"She wants to continue to be a powerhouse,\" Boenig said. \"I'm going to ask for her to take on a bigger leadership role on the team next year.\"\nMorris said she will continue to concentrate on the goal she's always had of staying consistent in every competition; something she believes is one of the hardest things to do in any collegiate sport.\n\"Honestly, I don't know how it could be any better,\" Morris said. \"But if the next two years I am there we are able to win the team championship again that would just be fantastic.\"\nThe problem is Morris will face a new challenge next year, as opponents will be gunning for her.\n\"It isn't going to be an easy road next year because people are going to remember her,\" Boenig said. \"She has become a moving target and she has to keep moving to stay on top because they are coming back stronger and better prepared for her.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-25T20:54:19Z","url":"https://www.latimes.com/socal/la-canada-valley-sun/sports/tn-vsl-xpm-2010-06-23-tn-vsl-sp-equestrian-20100623-story.html"}
{"text":"Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has doled out sops and freebies to dalits, backward classes, minorities and economically weaker sections, considered the Congress’ vote bank, in the 2014-15 budget ahead of the crucial Lok Sabha elections. For urbanites, the budget was a raw deal as neither big projects were announced to improve living conditions, nor employment opportunities created.\nThe budget proposal presented in the Assembly on Friday had no major programmes for asset creation or new flagship schemes. At the same time, Siddaramaiah, who also holds the finance portfolio, did not impose any fresh tax on the common man despite a shortfall in revenue to the tune of Rs 3,716 crore in the current fiscal.\nIn an effort to blunt the influence of the Aam Aadmi Party in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah announced that a separate anti-corruption legislation will be enacted in the State on the lines of the Centre’s Lokpal Act. He has not honoured his promise to provide free laptops to PUC students, though SC/ST students of professional courses will get the gadget.\nSiddaramaiah restrained from imposing fresh taxes on commodities. He also left stamp and registration levies and motor vehicle taxes by and large untouched. However, prices of beer and liquor will go up.\nSiddaramaiah hiked additional excise duty on beer by 13 percentage points and imposed a 5.5-per cent Value Added Tax on spirits served in bars, clubs and star hotels in urban areas. VAT was being imposed on liquor for the first time, a move that would fetch the exchequer an additional Rs 200 crore per annum. The additional excise duty on beer will fetch another Rs 100 crore. These were the two only additional resource mobilisation measures (ARM) in the budget.\nInterestingly, the budget proposal and ARM measures will come into effect from March 1. Traditionally, new budget proposals come into effect from the start of the financial year, April 1.\nSiddaramaiah increased grants to the SC/STs under various departments from Rs 8,614 crore to Rs 15,834 crore. The biggest sop in the budget was the Rs 2,718-crore loan waiver scheme for 11.41 lakh beneficiaries who had secured loans for constructing houses under the Ashraya programme.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T08:57:11Z","url":"https://www.deccanherald.com/content/386466/no-taxes-budget-focus-weaker.html"}

Both are suspects in the deaths of Latrice Renee White, Jeremy Deon Norris and Kendrick Dwann Horn.\nRapides Parish District Attorney Phillip Terrell said Wednesday that his office intends to seek the death penalty for Matthew. A decision hasn't been made regarding the case with Ebony, he said.\nThe bodies of all three victims were found on one day — Oct. 18 — in two different locations. White's body was found lying on Melrose Street in Pineville. The 42-year-old woman had been stabbed and thrown from a car.\nHours later, the bodies of Norris, 28, and Horn, 33, were found on fire in a ditch on Old Boyce Road outside of Alexandria.\nThe siblings were arrested and charged within a week. Law enforcement officials were tight-lipped when announcing the arrests, but the indictments against the pair provide a few more details into what officials believe happened.\n\"I don't want to go into any detail about evidence and how much evidence we have, and get into the facts of the case that might hinder the DA with his prosecution of this case because it is a very, very serious case,\" said Rapides Parish Sheriff William Earl Hilton at a press conference announcing the Sonniers' arrests. \"There's gonna be a lot of court in front of us to get this through the system and to get these people convicted and bring justice to them and to the community.\"\nMatthew, 29, was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of obstruction of justice. Ebony, 31, was indicted on two counts of first-degree murder, one count of second-degree murder and two counts of obstruction of justice.\nThe second-degree murder charge against Ebony is for White's death.\nThe counts from both indictments concerning White and Horn state that the siblings \"had the specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm upon a victim who was a witness to a crime\" for the purpose of preventing their testimony in a criminal action or proceeding.\nThe indictment against Matthew alleges that he killed Norris, also known as \"Apple,\" during an armed robbery or attempted armed robbery \"while engaged in the distribution and exchange or an attempt thereof of a controlled dangerous substance.\"\nEbony was a principal to Norris' murder, alleges the indictment against her.\nThe obstruction of justice charges accuse both of removing the bodies of Norris and Horn from wherever the homicides happened, \"cleaning and attempting to clean the blood and firearms evidence from inside a blue Dodge Dakota truck\" and then wrapping both bodies in material from an above-ground swimming pool.\nThe indictments continue that the pool material was secured to the bodies with cables and that both bodies were set fire on Old Boyce Road.\nAttorneys from the Louisiana Capital Defense Project now are listed as representing Matthew in Rapides Parish Clerk of Court records. Two motions already have been filed in the case, including one to reduce bond that also is scheduled to be heard on Dec. 12.\nHugo Holland, who prosecutes death penalty cases across Louisiana, is representing the state, according to the records.\nAccording to the clerk's website, Ebony does not have an attorney yet.\nBoth remain in the Rapides Parish Detention Center.

{"text":"It is a nightmare scenario hospitals must be prepared for, although they hope those preparations will never be used.\nOn Monday, that nightmare came to Kingston General Hospital when the sound of gunshots shattered the normal hum of the busy hospital.\nMillhaven Penitentiary inmate Corey Ward is alleged to have disarmed a correctional officer and fired his gun, wounding the visiting family member of a patient in the leg. Ward has been charged with three counts of attempted murder and a review has been launched.\nIn response to the shooting, the hospital declared Code Silver, which is designed to alert staff to the existence of a person with a weapon in the hospital and to set off planned emergency procedures.\nCode Silver is the latest colour code that is part of hospital emergency preparedness. It was introduced by the Ontario Hospital Association in 2016, 25 years after a standardized system of colour codes, including Code Orange for an external disaster and Code Red for a fire, was introduced.\nCode Silver is, to a certain extent, a sign of the times, with a steady increase in gun violence across the country.\nWillmore is currently working on modules to train employees at The Ottawa Hospital on what to do in the event of a Code Silver.\nHospital shootings remain rare in Canada, although that is not the case in the United States. Between 2010 and 2011, there were 154 hospital-based shootings in the U.S., according to one study. Numbers have most likely increased since then.\nOn Monday, while Kingston General was dealing with Code Silver, a police officer, a doctor and a pharmacy resident were all shot at Chicago’s Mercy Hospital.\n“This is a rather rare event, but not so rare that we can’t pay attention to it,” said Willmore. In fact, he noted, there has been a steady rise in gun violence in Canada — especially in Ontario — in recent years.\nKingston is not the first Canadian hospital to be shattered by gunfire. In Cobourg a man shot his wife and then was shot by police at the local hospital in 2017. There have been several other shootings in hospitals across the province in recent years, including in Fort Erie and Northumberland.\nThe Ottawa Hospital, which held a Code Orange training exercise last week based on the scenario of a mass shooting in the community, is, like other hospitals, preparing for a possible shooting within one of its campuses.\nWillmore is working on a 15- to 20-minute simulation module that staff in various departments can do. The exercise gives staff a scenario involving an active shooter in the hospital and takes them through what they should do.\nThe reality of active shooters, though, is that there are few things people can do to remain safe.\nThe options are limited to running, hiding or trying to survive by whatever means possible, Willmore said. That could include fashioning weapon out of equipment in the hospital to try to disarm the shooter. The scenario also raises potentially difficult ethical questions — including whether to remain with a patient who is unable to hide.\nDr. Alan Drummond, an emergency physician at the Perth hospital and co-chair of public affairs for the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, said there is growing alarm about violence against staff in hospitals, including gun violence.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T20:19:31Z","url":"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/how-ontarios-hospitals-have-prepared-for-gun-violence"}

{"text":"SACRAMENTO — Returning to his alma mater, C.K. McClatchy High School, Attorney General Xavier Becerra stood in front of students, parents and cameras Tuesday night to deliver the Democratic response to the State of the Union in Spanish.\n“It says to other students that it does not matter where you come from, how humble your background may be, you can reach those dreams through hard work,” said C.K. McClatchy Principal Peter Lambert.\nHaving sued the Trump administration 45 times over varying issues, the attorney general is used to being at odds with the president. His speech was expected to be no exception.\n“He is the symbol of resistance in California,” said CALmatters columnist Dan Walters.\nWalters said we should expect immigration and health care to be top focuses for Becerra’s rebuttal.\n“He’ll be talking about immigration, seeing himself as kind of the embodiment of the American dream. His parents were immigrants from Mexico,” Walters told FOX40.\nWhile Tuesday night’s speeches are mostly symbolic, Walters says talking points will be geared toward party agendas for the presidential election.\nAs for students watching in the audience, just seeing an alumnus from their school on the national stage is a point of pride.\nThe attorney general’s speech was not the first time a State of the Union response was delivered in Spanish, as well as English. The first time that happened was back in 2011.\nIt is an honor to be here with you from C.K. McClatchy High School in the City of Sacramento, the capital of the State of California. I am here with future leaders of our country — McClatchy students — where I also studied, but about four decades ago!\nMy parents began their life together in the United States for the same reason that many other families come to this country: to work hard and give their children a better life. Upon leaving Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, they brought with them their faith and not much else. They trusted in the promise of this country that all those who work hard and play by the rules, have earned the opportunity to get ahead.\nI know I am the product of those who fought to open the doors of opportunity. The optimism – that characterizes the waves of immigrants who have come here – runs through my blood. And if the state of our nation can be characterized as “strong,” it is because people like my parents and yours — citizens or immigrant — built this country.\nThere is no other country like the United States.\nThe world needs us strong and ready. The world looks to us as a leader and partner.\nHow can it be, then, that our young, rich, and strong nation finds itself in a state of disorder, stress, hostility?\nHow can it be that what defines the state of our country in 2019 is the shutdown of the government at the hands President Trump? And not only once, but perhaps a second time in the coming weeks.\nIt shouldn’t surprise us that the majority of people here in the United States think that the country is moving in the wrong direction. And that four out of 10 Americans believe that this is the worst government that they have seen in their life.\nIf President Trump wanted to seriously advance comprehensive immigration reform, including border security, Democrats are and have been ready. But closing our government — and leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without work or pay — is not that way to do it.\nWe are ready to reject this foolish proposal, in court, the moment it touches the ground.\n1. They are also putting a wall between you and your doctor, dictating what services you can receive. That is why my fellow Attorneys General and I defend, in court, people like Elizabeth from Florida. Having healthcare coverage allowed her to complete university and ensured that her husband had coverage to defeat cancer. And now, Elizabeth is an attorney.\n2. Also the Trump Administration — they are putting a wall between you and the voting booth. But I have news for you here: They failed! During the November elections, Latinos, especially young people, came out to vote in historic numbers! Thank you!\n3. What else? They are also putting a wall between our veterans and their medical services. They are ready to waste millions of dollars on a border wall instead of helping our veterans who deal with long delays in hospitals.\n4. And they’re also building a wall between parents and their children, by putting children in cages that separate them from their families.\nNow that you see your power, are you ready to open new doors?\nDon’t you think that it is already the time that we in our government build schools, not walls? Then, get those hands ready to vote in the next election!\nOur system of government rewards the participation of everyone. And with 66,000 Latino citizens reaching 18 years of age, the voting age, every month, we have many hands to reward.\nAnd comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken system: Check! Check! Check!\nIn the courts and in Congress, or at the polls, we have to fight for our agenda. That is why I have fought as Attorney General in court against the President’s Administration and we are winning!\n1. In protecting the DACA program, we fought and won for 700,000 young people.\n2. In protecting the Affordable Care Act, we are the protagonists. More than four million Latinos depend on the ACA for their health insurance.\n3. In protecting college students against fraudulent loans, we fought and won for thousands of them.\nOver the years, they have reaped the fruits of their labor and dedication to their family. There is no doubt that the ‘State of the Union’ of Maria Teresa and Manuel Becerra is strong and resilient.\nIf you asked my parents what is the state of our Nation, I am sure they would paint an image more real than what President Trump presented tonight. They know what it means to work hard and to respect the rules.\nAnd they know well that to stay strong as a united people, we have to work together and push those heavy doors open so that all our children – like the students from CK McClatchy – can walk through them, and have an opportunity.\nWhether it’s with marches on the streets or marches to the polling booths, with fights in the court or through Congress, we will do what’s needed to ensure a strong and vibrant national Union.\nFriends, with faith and the strength of our labor, and respecting the diverse contributions of the American people, the United States will continue to be the home of the American Dream.\nThank you. Good night and may God bless you.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T02:22:38Z","url":"https://fox40.com/2019/02/05/attorney-general-becerra-to-deliver-state-of-the-union-response-at-sacramento-high-school/"}

Don’t you have a needle and thread I asked? No, she told me and I am not sure how to do it if I did.\nI wondered if my eighth grade sewing teacher, Mrs. Barnes, was rolling over in her grave. I can remember hemming a tea towel over and over again when I was in school because I couldn’t get the stitches even enough to please her.\nWhen I think how many things my grandkids have never learned, I realized I was glad that sewing was a requirement when I was in junior high school. It was certainly a pain at the time, but it gave me a skill I may never have had otherwise.\nAnd while no one has ever asked me to prepare a Rosy Apple Compote, I remember that was one of the first requirements in my cooking class. Our cooking teacher also taught us the presentation was as important as the food itself.\nWe had to prepare a special breakfast for Easter and I added a little red and blue food coloring to my scrambled eggs. My teacher was very impressed and I got an A, probably the only one I got in that class.\nMy dad was much less overwhelmed when I prepared my special dish for him on Easter morning. He thought it was the most disgusting mess he had ever seen and looked more like liver than eggs. Needless to say, I didn’t cook for my dad again until after I was married.\nAnd I can’t remember which class I was in when I was in high school, but one of my teachers taught us all how to balance a checkbook. I have discovered that is a lost art. Even my own kids bank online and accept whatever the bank says as their balances. I am still not that trusting.\nI’m not sure how long ago schools stopped teaching basic life skills, but it’s a shame they did. We have an entire generation of folks who have no idea how to change their own oil in the car. Of course, most people would rather have someone else do that anyway.\nBut what if the handle on your toilet breaks? Do you really need to call a handy-man for such a simple fix? I’m not one to preach about repairs. If it can’t be fixed with Duct tape or Super Glue, I am lost. But I can sure iron a crisp white dress shirt.\nI know I am somewhat of an anachronism, but we Baby Boomers may be the last generation that was prepared to take care of ourselves. Hopefully, at some point, the millennials will realize there is no app that can do the laundry, sew, cook and create a budget. Maybe those chores will have to be revisited.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T08:05:45Z","url":"https://www.coshoctontribune.com/story/opinion/2016/07/16/basic-life-skills-overlooked-school/86997362/"}

{"text":"The United States Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, says that the US cannot afford to wait for conclusive proof of Saddam Hussein's weapons programs before it attacks Iraq.\nHe equated the reluctance of America's allies to get involved with the appeasement of Nazi Germany.\nHis most outspoken remarks on Iraq to date appeared to be a deliberate move by the Bush Administration to ratchet up the anti-Saddam rhetoric in the face of scepticism at home and abroad.\nSpeaking of Nazi Germany, Mr Rumsfeld told Fox News on Tuesday: \"Think of all the countries that said, 'Well, we don't have enough evidence'.\n\"I mean Mein Kampf had been written. Hitler had indicated what he intended to do. Maybe he won't attack us. Maybe he won't do this or that. Well, there were millions of people dead because of the miscalculations.\"\nHe said the risk of a terrorist attack with a biological, chemical or nuclear weapon was so high, that the US could not wait for more evidence before acting.\nIn another development, intelligence officials on Tuesday said at least a handful of senior members of al-Qaeda had taken refuge in Iraq.\nIraq has often been cited by US officials as a haven for al-Qaeda fighters who have fled the US military campaign in Afghanistan.\n\"There are some names you'd recognise,\" a defence official said.\nThe reports of a more significant al-Qaeda presence in Iraq come as the Pentagon plans for a possible invasion. They also serve President George Bush's arguments for toppling Saddam.\nA senior US intelligence official said there was no evidence that Saddam had formally \"welcomed in or sheltered\" the terrorists.\n\"They are not the official guests of the Government,\" another official said. They were largely still \"on the run\".\nBut Mr Rumsfeld scoffed at the notion that al-Qaeda's members were hiding in Iraq without the full knowledge or protection of the Government.\nIraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday that members of al-Qaeda were operating in the northern part of Iraq and were not under the control of the Iraqi Government.\nThey were operating under the Kurdish opposition leader, Jallal Tallabani, \"an ally of Mr. Rumsfeld\".\nMeanwhile, General Wesley Clark, NATO's commander during the Kosovo war, has joined the growing ranks of US elder statesmen, including prominent Republicans and former US military commanders, in urging caution about attacking Iraq.\nGeneral Clark said on Tuesday that privately even the \"hawks\" in the US Government acknowledged that Iraq was no threat to America.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T01:01:49Z","url":"https://www.smh.com.au/world/rumsfeld-wants-to-rumble-without-proof-20020822-gdfkb7.html"}
{"text":"The long wait for Tesla's new Model 3 is almost over.\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will unveil the company's first car for the masses Thursday night. Tesla fans who can't afford the Model S, which costs between $70,000 and $140,000, have eagerly awaited this day for years. The Model 3 will be priced at about $35,000.\nTesla will start taking $1,000 deposits from buyers in stores Thursday morning, and online at 10:30 p.m. ET that night, which is when the car will be unveiled.\nBut there are still more questions than answers about the Model 3. Here's what we do -- and don't -- know about the car.\nWhen can buyers actually get one?\nTesla expects to start delivering the Model 3 in \"late 2017.\" So even if you're one of the first to reserve one, it'll still be a long wait. And ramping up production can take a while, so it could easily be 2018 before even early buyers can get their hands on a car.\nThe Model 3 will be more like Tesla's Model S sedan than its Model X crossover. But the company has kept the design under wraps. It definitely won't have the distinctive falcon wing doors of the Model X.\nHow far will it go on a charge?\nThe base model Model S has a minimum range of 240 miles, but the Model 3 probably won't go quite as far. The Model 3's battery will be smaller and lighter in order to keep the cost of the car down, and the size of the battery pack is what determines range.\nMusk has been quoted as saying 200 miles should be the minimum range for any all-electric car.\nAt $35,000, the Model 3 will cost about half the price of the base version of the Model S. And buyers will get tax breaks -- there's a $7,500 federal deduction, and some states offer as much as $2,500 in credits. The average price of all new cars today is about $34,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.\nWhat options will it offer?\nMusk said in February that Tesla might hold back on some features for the Model 3 to get the car to market faster, having learned a lesson with the much delayed Model X SUV.\n\"In retrospect, it would have better to do fewer things with the first version of Model X, and then roll in ... new technologies over time,\" Musk said. \"I do think that there was some hubris there with the Model X.\"\nOf course, some of the most talked-about Tesla features cost thousands of dollars. If they're available for a Model 3, they could quickly end the car's claim of being a moderately priced for those who add them.\nFor example, the \"ludicrous mode\" that lets the car to go 0 to 60 in only 3 seconds, adds $10,000 to the price of a Model S, and it requires all wheel drive, which adds another $5,000, as well as high performance motors that add $20,000. Autopilot features add another $2,500.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T13:52:46Z","url":"https://money.cnn.com/2016/03/30/autos/tesla-model-3/index.html"}
{"text":"Slowing economic growth in China is taking some of the glow off of one of the country’s greatest attractions for foreign businesses: consumers’ willingness to splurge on higher-priced goods as incomes rise.\nRein is the author of “The End of Copycat China,” “The End of Cheap China,” and “The War for China’s Wallet: Profiting from the New World Order.” Excerpts follow.\nQ. What’s your take on China’s economy?\nA. It’s much weaker than people realize. Labor markets are bad. Starting in October, it became very difficult for even kids from top universities like Stanford and Columbia to get jobs. When we started our business in 2005, they would graduate from the U.S. in June, they looked for a visa in the United States for three or four months, couldn't get one, and then came back to China. It used to take me a week in order for me to hire someone. I'd have to decide very quickly. Even in August 2018, we’d have to decide in a week. Now, people that I interviewed in October are still looking for jobs. The labor markets collapsed in October.\nSo from a consumer spending standpoint, that's hitting hard. They're starting to trade down. They're skipping the big-ticket items like houses and cars. They're still travelling overseas, but they're going not so much to America or the UK; they're now going more closer -- so Thailand and Japan. We're very bullish on domestic tourism.\nThe next thing is they're just trading down in general. So instead of buying a Starbucks latte, they're going to Luckin. Instead of going to Imax movie theaters, they're watching on iQiyi and online videos. So in 2019, the premiumization drive that a lot of people said consumers would do is over, and they're now trading down. A big shift.\nQ. What does all of this mean for multinationals? To what extent are multinationals caught up in China's mixed relations with the West?\nA. You haven't seen anti-American sentiment on the consumer side except for Apple. Because people feel that the United States is going into hostage diplomacy by arresting (Huawei CFO) Meng Wanzhou, people are supporting Huawei. But, in general, people aren’t buying multinationals’ (goods) not because of the economy and not because they're anti-American. It’s because they're becoming more supportive and more nationalistic when it comes to Chinese brands.\nFor instance, in 2011, we interviewed 5,000 consumers in 15 cities, and at the time 85% of consumers surveyed always buy a foreign brand over a local brand. In 2016, we did the same research. This time, 60% of consumers said they would always buy a domestic Chinese brand over foreign brand. I didn't even do the research in 2017 or last year.\nSo Apple's problems in China are not due to the economy. They're not due to anti-American sentiment. They're due to the fact that they're being out competed by Huawei, Oppo and Vivo at a much better price points.\nQ. How are multinationals as a group reacting to all of this?\nA. They're getting hit very hard. The only brands that are doing well would be heritage brands that have an incredible brand position – a Nike, Chanel, Estee Lauder. Other brands are in confused mode. They think it's the economy, but it's not. They need to adjust. They need to understand that the day Chinese just desire Western brands is over.\nQ. How should they adjust?\nA. They either need to buy a Chinese firm. They need to either go even more upmarket, in some cases they have to offer more value products.\nQ. Any recent examples of a multinational buying a Chinese firm? Multinational?\nA. You don't want to go too down. What you want to do is offer more like, “Buy five, get five.” It's more of a value play.\nA. The food market is a difficult one because companies are getting hit by Ele.me and Meituan. Anything that's 30 RMB and less is dead, because people can just buy something at half of the price. So you need to try to go more upmarket, be a little bit of premium, a little bit healthier. And then you're able to win. It's not easy.\nQ. That's what Yum is trying to do?\nA. That's what they're trying to do. I'm very negative on say McDonald's. All these guys earn a lot of trouble. For the first time in about a decade, I'm bullish on instant noodles. People are starting to buy the cheap three or four (yuan) noodles again.\nQ. When is this going to end?\nA. This is a long time period. The economy is a lot worse than people realize. None of my clients are making a lot of money. If nobody's making money, how on earth are you getting six percent growth？ I just I can't figure it out.\nA. There are two things hitting autos. First, prices are so high and people are concerned about their savings, and so they're skipping autos. It's hitting the American brands because of the tariffs. People are buying a Lexus and they're still buying a BMW because China has lowered the tariffs from Germany and Japan, but people are not buying American brands. You saw Ford’s sales dropped 50% year on year in the fourth quarter. And you also have the issue where people to use shared mobility. That's a big trend in China because it's very difficult to buy a license plate. It's expensive. I've never been able to get one. My company has had to buy all of my license plates and they cost $30,000 each. So the American auto manufacturers are in a lot of trouble. They're going to continue to double-digit (sales) drops this year.\nNow the second thing is people are hoping for an end of the trade war and they're saying if there is an end to the trade war China might lower the tariffs on cars even more. So people are taking a wait and see attitude to see is it going to be cheaper in three months. And that's what's happened with Tesla. They're waiting for when Tesla opens their factory in China in May, or when they lower their prices which they just did last week by $20,000-30,000. So the market for American autos in China is in trouble because people have no money, or if they have money, they have a wait and see attitude.\nQ. What does this shared economy mean for foreign businesses? It’s easy to think of Chinese companies like Didi benefitting and maybe a Geely, which seems to be building up a fleet to supply that sector.\nA. It’s too expensive to own a car in China, and a lot of Chinese -- younger Chinese especially -- tell us they don't even want to drive. It's too stressful, too much traffic, too expensive and too much risk of an accident. They'd much rather outsource driving either to a driver or autonomous cars.\nQ. Where can foreign companies fit into the shared space?\nA. What they can do is sell fleets. But if they sell fleets to the taxi companies, that lowers their brand image. Hyundai did that with the taxi companies; now nobody wants to buy a Hyundai. They could invest in some of the Chinese Internet players and do co-partners partnerships with them.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T04:32:44Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2019/03/17/a-big-shift-in-china-consumers-are-trading-down-author-says/"}
{"text":"On June 17, hundreds of thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent will be stateless.\nLast week, I wrote that the Dominican Republic has summarily stripped over a hundred thousand Dominicans born in the DR of Haitian parents of their citizenship and is threatening to deport them to Haiti. And though initial reports suggested that the deadline for deportation might be delayed, it now seems to be going forward as planned: In four days, hundreds of thousands of people in the Western Hemisphere will become stateless.\nWhere is the US press? Why aren’t they covering it? And why the silence from human-rights groups? The main page of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch has three posts on Venezuela. Nothing on the Dominican Republic. HRW’s director Ken Roth is a prolific voice on Twitter—yet nothing on the topic since November 11, 2014 (but do a Twitter search for @KenRoth and Venezuela and bathe in the stream).\nThe pope has spoken out, sort of. He told Dominican bishops that they “cannot be indifferent to the plight of Haitian immigrants.” Yet the impending expulsion will not be of immigrants but Dominicans of Haitian descent, born in the Dominican Republic, with family and friends and property and work in the Dominican Republic; many of them have never been to Haiti or know anyone in Haiti (though the Dominican press insists on calling them “Haitians”).\nThe Dominican government has set up a number of centers where Dominicans of Haitian descent can try to “regularize” their status, and thus avoid being expelled. It’s a charade. The offices are overcrowded, understaffed, and the needed paperwork doesn’t exist (many Dominicans of Haitian descent were born in rural areas, since their parents came to work the sugar fields, with midwifes and not in hospitals, and were therefore never issued birth certificates).\nAs of the 17th, hundreds of thousands of Haitians and Dominican-Haitians here will be rendered stateless and eligible for summary detention and deportation. The Dominican government maintains that they will not delay implementation of the law, despite pressure from the US, the UN, the OAS, and the Pope.\nThe government also announced last week that they do not intend to deport those who have already registered for legalization. However, I am documenting dozens of personal accounts from Dominican-Haitians who have gone to great lengths to register, some as much as 8-9 months ago, and as of today have not received any type of confirmation that their paperwork has even been processed. Without confirmation, they are still eligible for deportation. This does not even consider the hundreds of thousands of others who lack birth certificates and thus could not register in the first place.\nGiven the common practice of nightly police sweeps, the government solicitation of passenger buses, the official declaration of intent to pass Law 169-14 without delay on June 16, and the general history of anti-Haitian abuses on the part of law enforcement and government authorities, it is reasonable to assume that the infrastructure is now in place for mass detention and deportation of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent from the Dominican Republic. The general attitude among this vulnerable subpopulation is a mix of fear and resignation.\nThis aid worker is asking for contacts in the US press; he wants to stay anonymous but wants to report on what he sees over the next week, especially in poorer neighborhoods, where he has contacts and first-hand experience.

{"text":"Sentenced: Maurice Hennegan, 25, was sentenced to 32 years to life in prision for murdering a man who was romantically involved with Hennegan’s estranged girlfriend.\nA Bedford-Stuyvesant man will spend decades behind bars for a murderous crime of passion, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office.\nA Brooklyn judge sentenced 25-year-old Maurice Hennegan to 32 years to life in prison for gunning down a man who was romantically involved with Hennegan’s estranged girlfriend, according to prosecutors. Hennegan was convicted by a jury in March, and sentenced on April 10 by Supreme Court Justice Vincent Del Giudice.\nAccording to trial testimony, Hennegan confronted his ex-girlfriend on the morning of Sept. 28, 2016, about a relationship she had with the victim, 38-year-old Neil Thompson. Hennagan then went to the Bedford-Stuyvesant laundromat where Thompson worked, before finding him down the street, entering a deli at the corner of Hart Street and Tompkins Avenue.\nAt approximately 7:24 a.m., Hennegan followed the victim into the deli and fired a revolver multiple times from point blank range, killing Thomspson and hitting a 64-year-old bystander in the hand, prosecutors said.\nHennegan can be seen in surveillance footage from inside the deli during the incident, and he admitted his guilt in multiple text messages to associates following the shooting, but managed to evade authorities for several months, using elaborate disguises to mask his identity. The fugitive donned glasses and a fake mustache, grew out his hair, and used a walking cane, according to the District Attorney’s office.\nHennegan was eventually arrested, while in possession of 19 twists of crack-cocaine, on Feb. 16, 2017, at Varet Street near Manhattan Avenue in Williamsburg, according to prosecutors. He was convicted of second-degree murder and third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance.\nFollowing the sentencing, District Attorney Eric Gonzalez blasted the Hennegan’s recklessness and committed his office to cracking down on gun violence.\nBut all my favorite rap stars say guns be cool.

Johnson, 25, of Westerville, was being chased by troopers on I-71 when he apparently lost control of his vehicle after, running over some road spikes placed across I-71, and crashed into a guardrail.\nTroopers reportedly surrounded the man in the crashed vehicle, and after not hearing anything from him, approached the vehicle and discovered Johnson dead, reportedly of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

{"text":"Eli Sister (John C. Reilly) is a frontier hit man with a heart of gold. Familial duty forces the wouldbe shopkeeper to be one-half of a killing duo with his brother, Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix), a drunk just like their Pa. Together, they are the most-feared hired guns roaming the Oregon plains. Their mission in “The Sisters Brother” -- a darkly funny and (surprisingly) sweet Western -- is to find a prospector/chemist named Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed), torture him until he reveals his secret formula for mining gold, then kill him. Easy peasy. Especially when abetted by John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a \"lead man\" sending the brothers poetic dispatches on Warm’s whereabouts.\nThe movie -- based on the 2011 novel by Patrick deWitt and adapted and directed by France’s Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet”) -- isn’t as straightforward as it appears. This is not your grandfather’s Western. No, Audiard has more ironic thoughts on his mind, and his top-notch cast provides the perfect vessel to explore brotherhood, greed, friendship and sacrificing the life you want to live for the life you have to live.\nIt doesn’t always stick the landing. The shifts in tone are jarring, changing on a dime from Coen Brothers-esque to a more violent Tarantino vibe. I applaud the ambition, even if the slapstick and serious stuff don’t always meld. The plot moves slowly, like a man on horseback, as Audiard oscillates between the brothers and Morris tailing Warm. The film, set at the height of the Gold Rush, is lean on plot and heavy on character study, with the brothers regularly trading barbs and punches on their way to San Francisco, where all four characters will connect, much to the story’s benefit.\nBe warned: “Sisters Brothers” is not for the squeamish. There’s blood, guts, huge spiders and a cringe-worthy amputation. The body count is high, “six or seven” in the opening frame alone, as the brothers botch a job, killing everyone inside a house. Horses are not safe, either. The sibs might murder, scheme and steal, but it’s not all grim. In one standout scene, Eli has a tender, if awkward, exchange with a prostitute, asking her to re-enact the moment the woman he loves gave him a red shawl. Every night Eli cuddles that wrap while falling asleep. It is ironic bits like that that forgive the film’s early monotony.\nGyllenhaal and Ahmed share an easy screen rapport, just like they did in the underrated thriller “Nightcrawler.” Ahmed’s Warm is an earnest fellow, hoping to make a buck so he can form a “true democratic society” in Texas. Gyllenhaal’s Morris speaks with precision and writes about his travels in a “book of adventures.” Rutger Hauer (“Bladerunner”), in a blink-and-you’ll miss him cameo plays the Commodore, the brothers’ employer.\nThe terrific cast props up the writing to make the material seem better than it is. Even watching Reilly’s Eli brush his teeth for the first time is weirdly sweet. With all this talk of gold propelling the action, it’s Reilly who has the Midas touch.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T20:44:00Z","url":"https://cohasset.wickedlocal.com/entertainmentlife/20181005/movie-review-john-c-reilly-is-heart-and-soul-of-sisters-brothers"}
{"text":"Police and fire departments across the country are cracking down on officers for posting racist, violent memes and comments. But it’s not enough.\nDallas shooter Micah Johnson’s attacks towards law enforcement have incited a new wave of anti-Black Lives Matter declarations by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and others, who have called the group “inherently racist.” They believe BLM is, in part, to blame for the deaths of the five police officers.\nNow many law enforcement officers and other civil servants have been reprimanded for making offensive and even threatening social media postings describing BLM activists as racists and terrorists. Individual officers have been demoted, suspended, or in few cases, fired, after community members reported posts to city officials.\nThe name of the patrol officer was not initially released by the South Carolina police department. It was only released after it spread via social media, a model Sergeant Michael Woody from the Detroit Police Department says was followed in the case of Detective Weekley.\nAs Sergeant Woody’s statement suggests, it is likely that there are far more incidents of this nature that have been reported. Though underreported, other inappropriate social media postings by law enforcement officers have come to light this week.\nDerek Hale, a sergeant for Louisville Metro Corrections was suspended after sharing an abhorrent meme on Facebook featuring a white police officer and the words, “If we really wanted you dead all we’d have to do is stop patrolling your neighborhoods...and wait.” Two Memphis policemen were placed on suspension after one allegedly posted a Snapchat picture featuring a gun aimed at an emoji of a black man running.\nLieutenant R. Kelley Hughes, Communications Liaison for the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, told The Daily Beast that in addition to Captain Morris, another local fireman and a local paramedic were also discharged due to inappropriate or threatening social media statements related to the Columbia BLM protest.\nOfficer Rodney Lee Wilson of the Overland Park force in Kansas was also fired for threatening comments posted on Facebook. “We’ll see how much her life matters soon,” he commented on a photo that LaNaydra Williams of Dallas, Texas posted of her 5-year-old daughter, India, back in 2014. “Better be careful leaving your info open where she can be found :) Hold her close tonight it’ll be the last time [sic],” he wrote.\nIn light of these incidents, some police departments have developed specific social media policies for employees to follow. The Nashville Police Department’s policy on social media use urges employees to “act with respect and exercise common sense…do not engage in any online communications that could reflect negatively on the department or its members,” and includes a reminder that “existing rules of conduct” apply to social media usage.\nYet without specific protocols in place, it is likely to continue and many officers will keep expressing racist and/or violent views on social media without any disciplinary action.

I can&apos;t understand why this happened,\" Chen said, a pair of crutches nearby.\nThe workplace deaths of the UPS drivers — Wayne Chan, 56; Benson Louie, 50; and Mike Lefiti, 46 — shocked San Francisco and stunned UPS workers. Chen said he felt compelled to speak out about the dead drivers to speculation that Lam might have been motivated to open fire because of bullying.\nA San Francisco Police Department official has said Lam appears to have felt disrespected by co-workers, but did not know if that motivated the shooting.\nThe officer spoke on condition of anonymity because the officer was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.\nChen said Lam never indicated before the shooting that he had problems with other workers, and said he had a friendly chat with Lam about their routes on the Monday, two days before the shooting. They spoke Cantonese to each other, although Lam&apos;s ethnicity is unclear. Records show Lam moved to the United States as an infant from Thailand.\nThe day of the shooting started like any other work day, Chen said, with drivers doing warm-up stretches and listening to company announcements before they were scheduled to climb into their trademark brown UPS trucks for the day.\nChen said he was standing in his usual spot, by Chan and Louie, when he heard a loud pop like a firecracker behind him. He dismissed it as a prank but turned and saw smoke.\nHe heard a second pop and felt pain. When he looked down, he saw blood pouring down his leg.\nChen got into the cab of the truck closest to him, hoping to hobble out through the truck&apos;s rear door and slip down a hallway and into the street.\nHe was about 60 feet (18 meters) from the exit when he saw Lam blocking his path, scanning the room as if looking for someone.\n\"But I don&apos;t know who he&apos;s looking for,\" Chen said.\nHe turned back, checking to make sure he wasn&apos;t being followed. He encountered another UPS driver hiding behind a truck. That&apos;s also when Chen noticed a body on the ground. It was his friend Wayne Chan.\nTerrified to stay put, Chen decided to find a hiding place and went into an empty office, bleeding as he ran.\n\"I knew if I don&apos;t run, I may get killed,\" he said.\nPolice eventually found Chen on the floor behind a desk, unable to stand up and with his hands raised as officers had demanded. Chen found out when he was being treated at a hospital that Louie had also been killed.\n\"I keep dreaming every night when I close my eyes, that moment. It&apos;s really scary, I can tell you,\" he said. \"And you don&apos;t want it to happen next to you and around you. It&apos;s a very, very bad experience.\"\nChen said he does not know how he feels about Lam, although it&apos;s more sadness than anger.\n\"I&apos;m not even thinking like I hate him or not,\" he said. \"I&apos;m not.\"\nAP reporter Linda Wang contributed to this report.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T22:21:01Z","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/apnewsbreak-motive-baffles-ups-workplace-shooting-survivor"}

{"text":"Dave Eggers' history as the motive force behind the experimental, expectations-challenging literary-goofery platform McSweeney's hangs heavily over his new book, What Is The What. Simultaneously billed as an autobiography and a novel, it does manage to be both: Eggers interviewed Sudanese refugee Valentino Achak Deng at length about his life, then wove his horrifying story into a fictionalized narrative. Eggers' stagy, novelistic writing is jarring, and it inevitably casts every given fact into doubt. But while it's sometimes hard to take the literary tropes seriously, the autobiographical content is riveting, and in all likelihood, more accessible than any similarly massive, sprawling non-fiction treatise on Sudan's politics.\nEggers frames Deng's story with a break-in at his home: Living as a political refugee in America, Deng is assaulted and robbed in his apartment, and his ordeal stretches out throughout 475 pages as, suffering, he recalls how he suffered as a child in Sudan. A child of an African tribe, the Dinka, he grows up in an ethnically mixed area, but political events far away forcibly set Arab tribesmen from north Sudan against the Africans in the south. The rebel group SPLA, led by Dinka John Garang, is no friendlier, and Deng and his family are caught in the middle, seeking safe havens in an increasingly unstable, violent battleground. When Arab horsemen destroy Deng's village, he starts a lengthy journey that lasts more than a decade and leads to multiple countries and refugee camps.\nEggers skims over the region's voluminous religious and political divides, presenting a bare-bones version of events and concentrating on the increasingly wild rumors and hopes that the refugees live by, and on the mundane details of life for a lost child in a generation of them. In his oddest conceit, his version of Deng mentally addresses each new installment of his story to the individuals he encounters or remembers, evoking their names over and over as he describes his heartbreaking journey. He isn't telling an abstract story to the air, he's recounting his own life directly and determinately to real people, demanding that they hear and see him. Though he couches that force of will in a mild, polite voice, it's hard to resist in any format. His story comes in an odd shape, but it reads as a story that must be told, and must be attended.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T14:47:21Z","url":"https://aux.avclub.com/dave-eggers-what-is-the-what-1798202279"}
{"text":"Super Bowl LIII wasn't the most exciting championship game, with the New England Patriots beating the Los Angeles Rams 13-3.\nHowever, some bettors may have had some exciting nights if they made the right calls. Of note, some unexpected props with large odds hit, leading to a great return on investment for those making the right calls.\nScott Hastings of OddsShark posted a list of Super Bowl LIII prop bet results Sunday, and here's a look at a few unlikelier props that returned well.\nThe over/under for this game was 55.5 points, so needless to say, the one-touchdown prop brought back a huge return on investment. If you were bearish on the Rams, you received 20 times your bet.\nPats quarterback Tom Brady made 35 pass attempts on Sunday. Only one of them was picked, but it just so happened to be his first. New England had 407 total yards and only one turnover, so it wasn't as if the offense was inept on a day when defenses largely ruled. But if you were particularly pessimistic about Brady's first throw, then you won big.\nPlaying Monday Morning Quarterback, this looks like one of the best value bets on the prop sheet. Edelman was the leading postseason receiver entering the playoffs and finished that way after his 10-catch, 141-yard performance.\nLos Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman (or the officials) were to thank for this one after he was questionably called for unnecessary roughness on running back Rex Burkhead.\nNot a huge surprise here as Michel had 53 carries and five touchdowns in his two AFC playoff games leading into the Super Bowl.\nBetting this prop feels like playing Russian roulette, as it's hard to discover an edge. Still, if you bet blue, cash your slips for four times your investment.\nBettors who placed this wager may have been nervous after Pats kicker Stephen Gostkowski missed a 46-yard field goal wide left with the score tied at zero, but after three punts, he hit a 42-yarder to break the scoreless tie.\nOn a night where defenses ruled, this is a fairly surprising result. Even more shocking was that this didn't hit the over after Rams defensive end John Franklin-Myers sacked Brady late in the first quarter. L.A. had three other quarterback hits, but none of them resulted in sacks.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T04:19:10Z","url":"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2819188-super-bowl-53-prop-bets-reviewing-results-for-biggest-hits-and-misses"}

{"text":"SALT LAKE CITY — Recent reports show that Utah's charter schools are improving, but are they doing enough to keep up with charter schools in other states?\nUtah's overall score from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools went up ten points from last year, settling at 131. Despite the rise in score, Utah dropped from 12 to 20 in comparison to other states. Alliance officials say it isn't because of any mistakes Utah is making, but because other states are dramatically improving.\n\"I think that's an indication that charter schools are very popular in the country, right now, and other states are being even more aggressive than Utah is with implementing them and putting them into place,\" said Utah State Charter School Board Chair Tim Beagley.\nBeagley said they're not too worried about the drop in the rankings. Some of it can be attributed to changes in how the rankings are made. He also said the study shows some areas where Utah can improve.\nOne of the things the state got dinged on was how they monitor a charter school's performance; other states require charter schools to re-certify every 10 to 15 years.\n\"(Here), they're really just driven by how popular they are and whether or not the students and the parents want to continue to use their services,\" Beagley said.\nUtah school administrators have a new system to track school progress and performance. The Utah State Office of Education on Friday unveiled the state's new system with the release of Utah Comprehensive Accountability System data for the 2011-12 school year.\nBeagley said they're moving forward with plans for better accountability, but they also need to improve the way charter schools get funding. Technically, there isn't a cap in the number of schools set by the schools board. The legislature does set limits on how many students they will give funding to.\n\"The way to solve that problem is to get a better funding mechanism where we don't really have a limit on the funding and the funding we have in place simply goes wherever the student goes,\" he said.\nHowever, officials in Utah meet with regulators in other states at least once a year to see what's working well and what isn't.\n\"We are very well connected, I think, to the other agencies in the country that are doing this,\" he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T19:15:32Z","url":"https://www.ksl.com/article/24035475/utah-charter-schools-drop-in-rankings-despite-improvement"}

{"text":"Your credit card company doesn't have your best interests at heart.\nCredit cards have caused financial pain for millions of consumers. It's easy to run up a balance, but as too many people find out the hard way, it's a lot harder to get it paid down. Even if you're diligent about getting your debt repaid, high interest rates work against you, creating a big headwind that's hard to fight against month after month.\nEven your credit card issuer's own policies can tempt you into staying in debt a lot longer than you should. By simply ignoring your card company's advice and doing what most people would logically think of as the right way to pay down debt, you can get your card balances zeroed out years sooner. Below, we'll show you how to do it and why so many people don't.\nThe problem that so many credit card holders run into has to do with the minimum payment provisions that card companies have. You'd think that a lender would want to get repaid as soon as possible, but that's actually not the case for credit card companies. The opportunity to charge double-digit interest rates in an environment where mortgage loans generate less than 5% interest for lenders encourages lenders to keep those card balances as high as possible for as long as they can.\nAs a result, the minimum payment provisions that many card companies use don't do much to pay down your outstanding balance. One common provision involves having someone repay the greater of 2% of their balance or $25 each month. That might sound like a lot, but when interest charges eat up more than half of those payments, there's not much left to apply toward reducing the principal you owe.\nAs a simple example, say that you have a $5,000 balance on a credit card that charges a 17% annual interest rate. Using the 2% or $25 rule, your minimum payment will start out at $100. Of that amount, more than $70 will go toward paying the interest on your $5,000 balance. The remainder will go toward paying down your debt slightly.\nThe next month, your balance will be about $30 lower, so your minimum payment will be incrementally lower, at $99.42. Because you owe slightly less money, your interest due will be lower, but it won't drop by as much as the minimum payment did. Over the ensuing months, you'll find that you pay down principal at a slower and slower rate, as your minimum payments fall.\nIt'll take you almost 10 years just to get your debt halfway paid off if you follow the strategy of paying just the monthly payment. Even after $25 minimum payments kick in around year 20, it'll still take you another seven years to zero out your balance. Over that 27-year period, you'll pay more than $10,000 in interest charges -- double the initial amount you borrowed in the first place.\nFortunately, there's a way to slash the time it takes to get out of debt and the interest you have to pay. Since you have to make that initial $100 minimum payment, it's reasonable to think that you can afford to keep making $100 payments in future months as well. Even if that's the only thing you change, the impact is immense.\nIn the example above, if you make sustained $100 monthly payments on your credit card, you'll get that debt paid down in a bit more than seven years. You'll pay roughly $3,750 in interest over that time frame -- producing interest savings of more than $6,000 along the way. The simple reason: Your $100 monthly payments ensure that an increasing amount of money goes toward paying down principal month after month, and the resulting faster decline in your card balance cuts your interest charges, creating a positive feedback loop that makes it easier to get your debt paid off.\nIt does take discipline to make more than the monthly payments you owe on your cards. Your bank is never going to encourage you to do so, and in fact, you can expect financial institutions to dangle offers that make it easier for you to take on more debt.\nBut being out of debt is a financial necessity, especially when it comes to credit cards. With such high interest charges, it pays to dig yourself out of credit card debt as quickly as you can, and simple strategies like this one can make it a whole lot easier.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T00:59:35Z","url":"https://www.fool.com/credit-cards/2018/06/01/get-out-of-debt-20-years-sooner-with-this-simple-t.aspx"}
{"text":"Sascha Segan MiFi 500 LTE by Novatel Wireless (Sprint) The Sprint MiFi 500 is a solid workhorse wireless hotspot for Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.\nRemovable battery. Solid Wi-Fi range. Supports Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.\nVery basic on-device display. No external antenna port. No global roaming support.\nThe Sprint MiFi 500 is a solid workhorse wireless hotspot for Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.\nNeed a solid, workhorse hotspot to use on Sprint's network? The Novatel MiFi 500 LTE (free with contract) is a reliable choice, besting its main competitor the Netgear Zing on our tests of speed and range. The Zing beats it out for an Editor's Choice based on its flexibility (especially with its optional desktop cradle), but the MiFi 500 is the one to go to if you need to blanket a larger area with Sprint Wi-Fi.\nThe MiFi 500 LTE is a nondescript little brick, when compared to the zingy Zing. It's a plastic puck, 3.8 by 2.4 by .7\" (HWD) and 3.35 ounces, made of shiny black plastic on top and soft-touch gray plastic around the sides. The back is removable, so you can replace the 1800mAh battery; I haven't found replacement batteries on the market yet, but I'm sure they're coming. The MiFi lacks an external antenna port.\nThere's a big gray power button on the top face, as well as a few physical navigation buttons. Hit the power button and the dim little OLED screen lights up with signal strength and battery indicators. By flipping through onscreen menus, you can find the Wi-Fi network name and password, check which devices are connected to the hotspot, check signal strength in dBm, and activate WPS setup.\nYou get many more management options on the simple, clear Web-based management portal. There, you can monitor your data usage, and set up your 2.4GHz-only 802.11 b/g/n network using VPN passthrough, DMZ, port filtering, and port forwarding.\nThe MiFi supports up to 10 Wi-Fi devices and can connect to an eleventh as a USB modem; plugging it into a Mac or PC it works right away, without installing any drivers. With an extra driver, it gives your PC GPS support.\nThe MiFi 500, unlike the Zing, is not world-capable. It only works on Sprint's 3G EVDO and tri-band LTE networks. Also note that Sprint's \"unlimited\" sales pitch doesn't apply to hotspots; all hotspot plans are capped, costing $34.99 for 3GB, $49.99 for 6GB or $79.99 for 12GB.\nTesting Sprint's new LTE network in New York City is an exercise in frustration. It's spotty and inconsistent, strongest in remote parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn. I had to use the Sensorly mapping app to find individual towers that Sprint had activated in Manhattan and Queens, and even then, the network showed a weird behavior with upload tests truncating early.\nThe reason to buy the new MiFi and Zing is that they support Sprint's new tri-band approach to LTE. Sprint has been taking its existing 1900MHz LTE network and supplementing it with 800MHz, which does much better at penetrating buildings, and 2600MHz, which should provide scorching speed in urban areas. Unfortunately, Sprint's buildout there is even less developed than their 1900MHz buildout, and we haven't had a chance to test the mixed coverage.\nBut you get what you get, and you try not to get upset. We tested LTE with the MiFi and Zing in five locations. In three of them, the MiFi was considerably faster. In one, the Zing prevailed, and in the last one, the MiFi dropped to 3G while the Zing pulled out decent LTE speeds.\nIndoors, the MiFi showed much better range than the Zing. While the Zing's speeds started to drop off after about 50 feet, the MiFi held on well to about 100 feet.\nThe Zing also showed slightly longer battery life than the MiFi—although remember, the MiFi's battery life really wins because the battery is replaceable. I got 7 hours, 40 minutes with the MiFi compared to 7 hours, 55 minutes with the Zing.\nIf you're looking for a Sprint hotspot and need long WiFi range without a cradle, the MiFi 500 is your pick. The Netgear Zing is more manageable and flexible, it roams worldwide, and it supports external antennas, so it's a better choice for most people.\nIf you have a Sierra Wireless Tri-Fi, I'd say hold onto it for now. Sprint just hasn't built out enough of its tri-band LTE network for the advantages to kick in quite yet. I'd peg early 2014 for when these hotspots will start opening up speed and coverage advantages over the Tri-Fi.\nBottom Line: The Sprint MiFi 500 is a solid workhorse wireless hotspot for Sprint's new tri-band LTE network.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T16:32:40Z","url":"https://www.pcmag.com/review/314773/mifi-500-lte-by-novatel-wireless-sprint"}

{"text":"I have to admit – I’m a huge breakfast person. But this Friday, waking up late for my 10 meant that I had to skip the most important meal of the day. Stomach grumbling, I made it through the end of my 11 and a meeting with just one thought keeping me going – eating The Box for lunch.\nFor those who have been away from campus or buried away in the stacks for a while, The Box is Dartmouth’s first food truck, founded by Tuck students, a non-DDS option for hungry students. Due to my meal-planning ineptitude, I was ready to try everything The Box had to offer by the time lunchtime rolled around. Luckily, the options were good and I grabbed a sandwich, side and dessert before settling down on a nearby bench and enjoying a rare burst of Hanover sunshine.\nMy first and only experience with falafel prior to this meal was during my foreign study program last term, when our group stopped by a well-known stand in Paris before proceeding to walk to the nearest metro station. In that short time, I managed to leave a messy trail of morsels from my falafel concoction down the sidewalks of the City of Lights. Classy, I know.\nThis time was no different – I proceeded to get those “mixed greens” all over my bench and self, desperately digging through my backpack for a spare napkin I had luckily stashed in there earlier in the term for emergencies like this. Despite my consumption struggles, I definitely enjoyed the sandwich. The salsa added a nice tangy flavor that blended well with the rest of the ingredients. The pita bread is also advertised as being made fresh every morning, which definitely added to the experience. Just don’t attempt to eat it gracefully on a date or something.\nThe granola was exciting because in my opinion, the nutty mixes tend to be pretty hit-or-miss. In this case, The Box’s was a definite hit – not only could I eat chocolate and still pretend to be healthy, but it had just the right balance of sweetness and saltiness with the nuts added in. If you need a quick snack that gives you energy and tastes delicious, this is a great option.\nSadly, The Box was out of their raved-about salted chocolate chip and oat cookie by the time I got there, so I opted for the other dessert option instead. The truffle had bits of date in it and tasted a bit nutty. It was slightly bitter, so I’d recommend it if you want a dessert that’s not too sweet. Next time I may try to get there earlier for the cookie, though.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend giving The Box a try at least once this term, though any more than that may put a bit of a dent in your wallet. I personally tend to have leftover DBA at the end of the term, so it’s hard to justify putting down 12 dollars for (an albeit delicious) lunch. I would also love to see more variety in the future — being able to customize your meal with a sandwich, salad or grain bowl is nice but having only three meal options to create them with caters toward limited palates. Still, The Box offers a nice alternative on Tuck Drive for when you just can’t stand another grim Novack lunch while doing work for your 2.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T20:41:43Z","url":"https://www.thedartmouth.com/blog/dartbeat/2014/05/dartbeat-reviews-the-box"}
{"text":"Responding to every bit of Russian propaganda \"is counterproductive, because it is reactive and you are always behind the curve,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Benjamin Ziff tells senators in Washington, Nov. 3, 2015.\nWhen a Russian news outlet edited the U.S. ambassador into a picture of an opposition rally, the U.S. Embassy countered by editing the ambassador into a series of improbable photos — for instance, on the moon and at an ice hockey rink.\nThe idea was to show that the original photo was propaganda, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Benjamin Ziff told a Senate subcommittee in Washington on Tuesday.\nThe ploy worked. “This tweet was retweeted extensively within Russia,” he said.\nModern Russian propaganda is no longer concerned with censorship. Rather, it is widespread and prolific, filling up the media space to such an extent that people sometimes can’t tell what is right and what is not.\nZiff said the Russians have “a sophisticated $1.4 billion-a-year propaganda apparatus.” They claim to reach 600 million people across 130 countries.\n“It’s skillful, it’s flexible and it’s adapted to the geography of the audience,” said Leon Aron, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy research group, and a member of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that oversees VOA.\nThe impact of all that Russian disinformation on Western democracies “appears paltry,” Aron testified, adding that the main reason is a highly competitive media environment that exposes people to a wide range of facts and interpretations.\nHere, Aron said, “the weaponization of information occurs” when it provokes strong negative emotions leading to hatred and worse.\nBoth Aron and Ziff told the Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on Europe and regional security cooperation that the answer is to empower local communities to develop a rich and uncensored media environment.\nAron gave an example, citing a report aired on Russia’s most widely watched television channel. A terrified woman identified as a refugee from the territory controlled by the Ukrainian government said she witnessed Ukrainian soldiers publicly executing the wife and son of a pro-Russian separatist: \"The child was crucified on a bulletin board in the center of the city, while the woman was allegedly dragged behind a tank until she was dead.\"\n“Complete fake,” said Aron, and it was exposed by the website stopfake.org, run by alumni and students of the Mohyla School of Journalism in Kyiv. Students tracked down the woman’s family. She had done the interview for money after her husband joined the pro-Russian separatists, leaving her with no means of support.\n“If there is one key theme that runs through the Kremlin’s thinking, it’s cynicism,” testified book author Peter Pomerantsev of the Legatum Institute, a public policy think tank. It is a cynicism, he added, that makes no distinction between democracies and authoritarian regimes, between truth and lies.\n“So it doesn’t matter if Vladimir Putin says one day there are no Russian soldiers in the Crimea and a few weeks later says, yes, there are, because what they are saying is there is no value to the idea of truth,” he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T05:56:38Z","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-propaganda-weaponization-information/3036087.html"}

{"text":"The Nokia Lumia 900 is the top of the Finns' range of Windows Phone handsets with a huge screen and 8-megapixel camera -- but can it offer enough to beat the best of Android?\nAt first glance, the Lumia 900 looks very similar to the slightly smaller Lumia 800, with similar colourful plastic shell. Come a little closer though and you'll notice the 4.3-inch screen, making it a much more substantial handful than the 800's 3.7-incher.\nBehind its protective Gorilla Glass the AMOLED touchscreen offers 800x480-pixel resolution, which is perfectly respectable but it's not among the sharpest, scraping in behind the iPhone, HTC One S and Samsung Galaxy S3. Even the 800 is a little sharper, since it squeezes the same pixel count into its smaller screen. It's beautifully sensitive though, and Nokia's ClearBlack technology offers rich contrast with exceptionally deep, dark blacks offsetting the slightly oversaturated colours.\nConsidering the price and the 900's place at the top of the Windows Phone tree, it's disappointing that it only offer a single-core 1.4GHz processor, especially since its rivals are now routinely offering dual-core or even quad-core handsets. Still, it ain't slow, and the relative simplicity of the Windows OS certainly seems to be in its favour, since it whips through the apps with ease, even when you have a bunch of them open and running.\nThe latest Windows Phone 7.5 Mango is the operating system, which is beautiful to look at, and easy to find your way around, even if you're a Windows Phone newbie. Facebook and Twitter are incorporated into the OS, so once you've set up your accounts, Facebook pictures and the latest tweets will start appearing on the dynamic tiles on your homepage. Disappointingly though, as with other Mango handsets, the 900 won't be making the jump to Windows Phone 8 Apollo when it comes along later this year.\nNokia Music, with its selections of playlisted music that you can stream for free; Local Scout also GPS to help you find some even rather obscure local stuff and there's a full version of the Microsoft Office suite on board too.\nThe browser looks good, but still lacks Flash support, so you won't be able to play all the video that's available, and the YouTube app is still only a link to the website, which is a shame.\nThe 8-megapixel camera comes with a Carl Zeiss lens, as we expect from the higher quality Nokia handsets. It opens quickly with a long push on the shutter button on the side and offers a range of settings to play with. Probably too many settings actually, unless you know what you're after when you're playing around with contrast, saturation, exposure, ISO, metering and white balance.\nDetail isn't quite as good as it should be and less than perfect light conditions were quick to throw up issues with noise. It will record video at 720p HD, which comes out pretty well even when played back on a much bigger screen. There's also a 1-megapixel camera on the front for self-portraits and video calls -- besides the larger screen, this is the main difference between the 900 and the 800.\nAs with other Windows Phone handsets, there's no opportunity to expand the memory via microSD card, so you're stuck with the 16GB of onboard memory plus the 25GB of free cloud storage that comes with Microsoft's SkyDrive service.\nThere's no option to replace the battery with a spare since it's sealed-in, iPhone-style, but it's a big 'un, and gave us a good one and a half days' worth of use.\nIt's bigger, but despite its really rather lovely screen, the Lumia 900 is really no more powerful than its little brother, the Lumia 800, which offers a similar spec for a more modest price.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T12:56:32Z","url":"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nokia-lumia-900-review"}

{"text":"When it comes to corruption and Congress, the line the law polices is the wrong line, writes Lawrence Lessig.\nSeven years after moving from the federal capital to a federal prison, former congressman (and top gun Navy pilot) Randy “Duke” Cunningham (R-CA) is going home. Convicted of bribery for trying to sell defense contracts for $2.4 million in cash and yachts, Cunningham was sentenced to what was then the harshest punishment ever meted out to a bribe-taking congressman.\nThe United States Congress needs the likes of Cunningham. Because the rare conviction of a member doing something plainly wrong reaffirms the claim of the others on Capitol Hill that they are not like him. Cunningham was a crook. He engaged in classic quid-pro-quo bribery. But no one credible believes that there are many more that stupid or perfidious. Congress is filled neither with top guns nor with craven criminals. And therefore, its leaders would have us believe, Congress is not corrupt.\nBut what the conviction of Cunningham should teach us is not that other members Congress should be trusted, but that the line the law polices is the wrong line. Sure, Cunningham was an exception, along with the man who broke his record for harshest sentence, William Jefferson (D-LA), who began a 13-year sentence last year, after federal agents found $90,000 in his freezer and tied that money to a $400,000 bribe. But corruption on Capitol Hill, in the plain meaning of the term that the Framers of our Constitution would have recognized, is endemic.\nCunningham reduced his deal to a very explicit transaction—literally, he wrote it down. In a bizarre note scribbled on his office stationery, Cunningham gave his co-conspirators a simple (if confused) schedule of how much it would cost to get the defense contracts they were seeking. What made his behavior a crime was this quid pro quo—not just that he would benefit personally; Cunningham would have been just as guilty if the payment was to be a campaign contribution rather than a yacht.\nSuch blatant exchanges don’t happen much—either for personal or for political benefit. But a more complicated dance certainly does. As lobbyists make their clients' cases to members of Congress, those members certainly know just how much those lobbyists have helped. That help isn’t a crime. Indeed, lobbyists are meticulous in keeping their behavior within formal ethical lines. But even within those lines, influence is peddled. And for members starved for campaign funds, even a very little bit can go a long way.\nThe economy of that dance plainly corrupts Congress. Because rather than staying focused—as Madison promised they would be—“upon the People alone,” Congress is increasingly focused upon it funders.\nYet those funders are not America. They are the tiniest slice of America. No more than 1/20th of 1 percent of us give enough to count as a relevant funder of a congressional campaign. And as members spend hours every day frantically trying to find some of that 0.05 percent who might help, they learn the words their funders want to hear. Remember the Skinner Box—a rat in a cage frantically trying to figure out which buttons it must push to get its pellets of food—and you have a good sense of the life of a congressman.\nThat dance does more harm to the Republic than an aircraft carrier full of Randy “Duke” Cunninghams ever could. For it is that sort of influence that steered Congress to deregulate Wall Street, that drives Congress to ignore climate change, and that says Congress can pass health-care reform only by including a $250 billion subsidy to insurance companies and Big Pharma.\nYet there’s nothing in the law to police this sort of corruption. Indeed, if Justice Kennedy really believes his own rhetoric in Citizens United, it may well be that the First Amendment would even ban an effort to limit this sort of corruption. And thus are we protected against the harmless sins, but are constitutionally required to remain vulnerable to radically more harmful ones.\nCunningham is a reminder of what’s not wrong with Congress. Congress is not a bunch of crooks. What Congress is is a democratic institution that, according to the latest Rasmussen Poll, can’t even garner more than 6 percent of the public’s approval. And that’s not because we don’t like what Congress does. It is instead because, as John R. Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse have powerfully demonstrated, we “believe special interests have hijacked the political process.” They—meaning almost all of Congress, not just the Cunninghams—are not in it for us, most of us believe. They’re in it for the funders and the funder’s agents, the lobbyists.\nThere are many contexts in which the law is obsessed with the relatively harmless sins while oblivious to undeniably harmful ones. But there is none as significant as this. America’s government doesn’t work because it refuses to grok this most obvious of corruptions. And until it does, it’s not just defense contracts that will get lost. It is practically every important decision that our government must make.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T11:40:00Z","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/congressmen-come-and-go-but-corruption-is-here-to-stay"}

{"text":"Business, medical, construction and development interests have poured money into the gubernatorial campaign of Republican Robert Bentley, while labor unions and PACs that received contributions from gambling have been a major source of cash for the campaign of Democrat Ron Sparks.\nAn analysis of the most recent campaign disclosure forms in the governor's race, filed last week, shows that both candidates received a majority of their major contributions from political action committees.\nOf the $3.3 million Bentley raised since the runoff, his largest contribution came from the Republican Party of Alabama PAC, which put in $435,000 drawn from businesses, other PACs, individuals and other Republican candidates.\nThe retired dermatologist also got a big boost from medical interests, including a $250,000 donation from Alabama Medical PAC, $25,000 from the dental PAC, $15,000 from the state anesthesiologists PAC, plus numerous individual contributions from doctors. Coupling the medical PAC donations with contributions from individuals identifying themselves as doctors, Bentley collected a total of $334,925 from medical sources.\nPolitical fundraiser Mike Echols of Tuscaloosa rounded up $220,540 for the Bentley campaign, contributing through PACs fueled by a variety of interests, including construction and nursing homes.\nThe nursing home industry also gave through its PACs, contributing $103,500.\nPACs operated by Tuscaloosa's Ryan deGraffenried III, which took in money from a variety of businesses including construction and paving, contributed $130,000 to the Bentley campaign. The same amount came from the constellation of business-oriented PACs operated by Montgomery lobby firm Fine Geddie.\nMontgomery lobbyist Clark Richardson distributed $64,000 from his clients and $50,000 came from PACs operated by Birmingham governmental affairs consultant Steve Bradley.\nTrucking industry PACs gave $50,000 to Bentley.\nPACs related to the construction and road-building industry gave heavily to Bentley, including $80,000 from cement producers PACS; $50,000 from the Alabama Builder's PAC and $47,000 from the Associated Builders and Contractors PAC. PACs related to the coal industry gave Bentley $31,000.\nOf contributions to Bentley $1,000 or greater, $267,500 came from businesses, $979,683 came from individuals and $1.4 million came from PACs.\nOf the $783,306 Sparks raised since his last report, the biggest chunk came directly from the state teacher's union, A-Vote, which gave $105,000.\nIn addition, Sparks received $17,000 from PACs operated by lobbyist Joe Cottle, which were largely funded by the teacher's union.\nSparks, who is running on his proposals to establish a lottery and legalize and tax casino gambling, took in $128,500 from PACs operated by lobbyists who have received donations either directly or indirectly from gambling interests.\nThat includes $57,500 from lobbyist John Teague's PACs and $28,500 from John Crawford PACs.\nIn addition to the teacher's union, Sparks also received $76,000 from a variety of unions.\nCoal industry PACs gave Sparks $25,000.\nMontgomery governmental affairs consultant Harvey E.

{"text":"The release of 26 Palestinian prisoners and the approval of West Bank settlement expansions has both Israelis and Palestinians crying foul.\nThe mother of Palestinian Salah al-Shaer, who has been held by Israel for 20 years, kisses his picture after hearing news on the expected release of her son in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, August 12, 2013. Israel on Monday named 26 Palestinian prisoners to be freed this week under a deal enabling U.S.-backed peace talks to resume, although Palestinians said these had been undermined by newly announced plans to expand Israeli settlements.\nA day after stirring harsh rebuke from Palestinians over the greenlighting of further settlement construction in Palestinian territory, the Israeli government angered many Israelis when it announced the names of 26 Palestinian prisoners to be released on Wednesday as part of the US-backed deal to relaunch peace talks.\nThe Financial Times reports that the prisoners' release – the first of 104 Palestinians Israel agreed in principle to free as part of the peace talks – is highly unpopular among the Israeli public because most of those being set free were convicted of the murder of Israelis or were suspected Palestinian collaborators.\n“It’s a victory for the Palestinians who are identified with the terrorists, and it’s a sad day for society in Israel and it’s a sad day for free society in the world,” Meir Indor, chairman of Almagor, a Jerusalem-based advocacy group for victims of terrorist attacks, told the Financial Times. The group has petitioned Israel’s Supreme Court to stop the release.\nUri Ariel, Israel’s housing minister and a member of the rightwing Jewish Home party in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, said on Monday that the release made a “mockery of the judiciary”.\nThe prisoners' names were announced early to provide a 48-hour window for those opposed to their release to file appeals to Israel's High Court. But Reuters notes that \"based on past decisions, the court is widely expected not to intervene.\"\nThe Israeli furor over the prisoners' release comes less than 24 hours after a similarly negative reaction from Palestinians in response to Israel's statement Sunday that it would allow construction of some 1,200 homes in West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements to move forward. Palestinians say that the move is an attempt to undermine the peace talks before they start.\n\"Approving such a massive number of housing units three days before we go to negotiations is sick,’’ a Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told The Christian Science Monitor. \"We may not come\" to the talks, he said.\nBut the Monitor also reports that some say the move was necessary to allow peace talks to proceed, by \"mollify[ing] Mr. Netanyahu’s pro-settler constituency, which is upset over the renewed talks\" and the prisoner releases.\nSome Palestinians also see the move as an Israeli tactic to undermine Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and force him to step away from the negotiating table – thereby making the Palestinians seem like the side opposed to peace.\nIsrael \"understands the psychology of the Palestinians. Now that the Palestinians want to override this settlements obstacle, Israeli radicals are planting minefields to undermine the credibility of the PA so it will walk away,\" says Mohammed Dajani, a political science professor at Al Quds University.\nIn an analysis for Haaretz, Barak Ravid writes that the Israeli government's contradictory responses to the peace talks stem from Netanyahu's unwillingness to \"cross the Rubicon\" and commit fully to them.\nOfficials who have spoken to Netanyahu say his behavior, his hesitation and zigzagging result from his lack of trust in Abbas. Netanyahu, say the officials, is willing to cross the river but wants to know if Abbas will do the same. He is worried that while he is jumping into the turbulent waters filled mostly with political whirlpools, Abbas will remain on the bank and let him drown alone.\nIf Netanyahu wants the Americans, Palestinians and most of all the Israeli public to take him seriously, he must leave his old tactics behind. Abandon the criticism, the spin, worn-out PR tricks and blame games - and enter the peace talks without looking back.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T15:44:10Z","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/terrorism-security/2013/0812/Israelis-seethe-over-Palestinian-prisoner-release-ahead-of-peace-talks"}
{"text":"Nearly 50 years of protests, lawsuits and ballot battles over low-income housing have made San Francisco a nationwide model for efforts to keep urban America from becoming home to only the very rich or the very poor, according to a paper that will be released Wednesday.\nThe land-use struggles that continue today, along with the long-remembered urban renewal fights of the 1960s, make it easy to forget just how far the city has come toward a community-centered development plan, said Marcia Rosen, former director of the city's Redevelopment Agency and lead author of the study of the city's affordable housing policy.\n\"The city originally wore a black hat when it came to development, but in subsequent decades we've worn the white hat,\" said Rosen, now the executive director of the National Housing Law Project.\nThe paper, done under the auspices of Rosen's organization and the Poverty and Race Research Action Council in Washington, D.C., will be unveiled at a San Francisco gathering of fair housing and community development groups. Wendy Sullivan, an attorney and planning consultant, is co-author.\nThe paper gives the city's community groups much of the credit for fighting City Hall in a long-running effort to keep San Francisco a racially and economically diverse community.\n\"Once notorious for urban renewal that diminished housing affordability and displaced residents,\" the paper says, \"San Francisco is now renowned nationally for its best practices in housing and community development.\"\nDespite \"limited land for development, extremely low rental vacancy rates and high demand for housing,\" over decades the city has developed \"thoughtful policies designed to preserve and enhance housing opportunities ... prevent displacement of low-income families and create inclusive communities,\" the authors say.\nBy providing examples of local innovations that work, similar efforts can be adopted by other cities and, ultimately, find their way into federal housing policy, said Philip Tegeler, president of the action council, a civil rights policy organization.\nSan Francisco \"provides an example of how community advocacy can work,\" he said. \"Cities need diversity. They need workers as well as executives.\"\nIt took time for local officials to realize that. The redevelopment projects of the '60s bulldozed chunks of the Western Addition and Yerba Buena, sending poor and middle-income residents packing to make way for wider streets, commercial development and civic projects. Aging residential hotels were razed in the name of progress, with little or no concern about what would happen to the people who called those places home.\nBut neighborhood and tenant organizations quickly formed to battle against the demolition efforts, filing lawsuits and gathering political support. As they won some battles, they pushed ahead with efforts to provide relocation help for ousted residents, limit evictions, ban residential hotel demolitions and require low-income housing and other programs.\nThe city's affordable housing movement wasn't just the product of the progressive community and angry tenants. For example, San Francisco voters passed limits on office construction in 1986, a $100 million affordable housing bond in 1996 and, earlier this month, a $50 million housing trust fund.\nSupport for affordable housing in the city \"doesn't just come down from the policy level,\" said Tiffany Bohee, who deals with a number of housing plans as executive director of the city's Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure. \"The voters have signaled resoundingly that this is what they want us to do.\"\nThe change documented in the paper has been dramatic. Although more than 3,200 housing units destroyed by urban renewal in the Western Addition were never replaced, the Rincon Point-South Beach redevelopment project - which added 2,800 units, 24 percent of them low-income, along with commercial space, parkland and AT&T Park - was built without destroying any housing.\nRosen's paper provides a look at the nuts and bolts of the city's housing wars, showing how activists took a little-noticed, grassroots liberal cause and made it so much a part of San Francisco's political mainstream that a former tenants' attorney is now the city's mayor.\n\"The business community and parts of the development community have signed on, realizing that affordable housing helps jobs and the city's economy,\" Rosen said. \"The process has been about building support in San Francisco and making it a place where nurses, teachers, restaurant workers and hotel workers can live.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-21T00:55:58Z","url":"https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-called-model-for-affordable-housing-4071941.php"}

The American Botanical Council estimates U.S. sales of herbal supplements came to $6 billion that year.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires companies to verify their products are safe and properly labeled, but supplements are exempt from the FDA's strict approval process for prescription drugs.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman says lax oversight of supplements can have serious public health consequences, noting a 2013 hepatitis outbreak traced to a tainted diet supplement and the death of a baby at a Connecticut hospital after doctors gave the child a probiotic supplement later found to be contaminated with yeast.\nLast week, Schneiderman ordered Wal-Mart, Walgreen's, Target and GNC to stop selling store-brand herbal supplements that DNA tests found questionable.\nSchneiderman's action followed a Clarkson University study he commissioned and he also referenced a 2013 study published by University of Guelph researchers.\nThe Clarkson study tested hundreds of bottles of store-brand herbal supplements sold as treatments for everything from memory loss to prostate trouble, and found 4 out of 5 contained none of the herbs listed on the labels.\nAt the University of Guelph, researchers used DNA fingerprinting to find that a third of 44 supplements tested contained no trace of the plant on the label.\nBut the dietary supplement industry takes issue with DNA testing and some consumer advocacy groups say the method by itself is inadequate because it cannot detect the most serious problems with supplements — contamination with heavy metals or chemical adulterants.\n\"There's no problem with DNA barcoding as a science; however, it should be used appropriately. It has limitations,\" said Nandakumara Sarma, director of dietary supplements for US Pharmacopeia, which sets quality standards and testing protocols for drugs, vitamins and supplements.\nThe United Natural Products Alliance, a trade group, says it is sending people out around the country to buy large quantities of the supplements cited by Schneiderman and submit the bottles, unopened, to five or six certified botanical testing labs for analysis.\n\"They will perform universally accepted methods and procedures to test the products and will independently report their findings, which will be made public,\" said Loren Israelsen, the group's president. \"We feel the most appropriate response to bad science is good science.\"\nThe American Botanical Council, a nonprofit research and education organization based in Austin, Texas, was particularly critical of the Guelph study.\n\"We raised the question if any of these products are extracts, and if so, what other analytical technologies were used to help ensure the validity of the results obtained by DNA testing,\" said Mark Blumenthal, the council's founder and director.\n\"DNA testing seldom is able to properly identify chemically complex herbal extracts, because often DNA doesn't get through the extraction process,\" Blumenthal said.\nHe said at least some of the products cited by Schneiderman are likely made from extracts, which can be validated by other common lab tests.\nTod Cooperman, president of the consumer-funded ConsumerLab.com, also dismissed the Guelph and attorney general's DNA studies as inappropriate for validating herbal supplements.\n\"There are definitely problems with herbal supplements but this is not the right method to test those products,\" Cooperman said.\nHis lab performs a range of tests on vitamins, herbal products and other dietary supplements to determine quality and purity, and provides the results to consumers who subscribe to his service.\nBlumenthal also is working to expose bad products. He launched the Botanical Adulterants Program four years ago to ferret out suppliers who sell adulterated or mislabeled ingredients to manufacturers of herbal supplements. One goal of the program is to identify what laboratory tests are most effective.\nPieter Cohen, a Harvard Medical School researcher whose area of expertise is tracking down dangerous supplements, said the new versions of methamphetamine he has found in diet and sports supplements would never be spotted by DNA testing.\n\"There is so much wrong with the quality of supplements today that it's a shame the New York attorney general is not using sound science to focus on the most important problems,\" Cohen said. \"The FDA has done hundreds of spot inspections of supplement companies, and they have found that 7 in 10 are not compliant with basic manufacturing practices.\"\nSchneiderman's office stands by the validity of its DNA testing.\n\"Rather than attacking testing methods that have been validated by more than 70 published papers, the time has come for the herbal supplements industry to put concerns about what is and is not included in its products to rest,\" Matt Mittenthal, spokesman for the attorney general, said in an email.\nThe attorney general's office did not respond to a follow-up email asking why conventional, widely accepted testing wasn't used to verify the DNA test results, which would have made the findings more indisputable.\nUS Pharmacopeia provides independent third-party certification to drug and supplement manufacturers, who can then use the certification to assure consumers their products are genuine.\nBut John Atwater, director of verification programs for the organization, said less than 1 percent of herbal supplements carry the USP mark.\nHe noted the program is voluntary. \"It's up to manufacturers and consumers to demand it,\" he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T10:38:29Z","url":"https://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/08/supplements-industry-derides-dna-tests/23079203/"}

{"text":"One week after a dog spooked by fireworks was hit by a SkyTrain, resident Bruce Mitchell is asking the City of Vancouver to revisit its fireworks bylaws.\nOn Oct. 29 2015, Mitchell’s East Vancouver home was burned to the ground in a fire caused by an errant firecracker. Mitchell’s two cats were killed in the fire, and he barely escaped with his life. When he heard that a dog had died this year after fireworks frightened her so much she bolted, Mitchell knew he had to speak up.\nWithin seconds, thick black smoke was pouring up the stairs, cutting off Mitchell’s exit. The 103-year-old wood frame house went up in flames almost instantly. The cats bolted. Mitchell escaped out the back deck and down a ladder with the help of his neighbours. The smoke and flames spread so quickly that had he been sleeping, he probably would not have survived.\nAuthorities confirmed that the blaze had been ignited by a firecracker. Mitchell’s neighbours reported seeing a group of young men dash away and leave the scene in a car. The group was questioned and released without charges.\nThe city of Vancouver bylaws allow sales of fireworks from Oct. 25 to 31, with the stipulation that users apply for a permit, be over the age of 19 and use the fireworks only on Oct. 31 and on private property. Mitchell says the bylaw is clearly unenforceable. When he saw the story about Maggie, a local lab-chow, who ran away last week after a firework spooked her in a public park, Mitchell reached out to share his experience.\n“I lost everything I owned, and my two cats lost their lives.” Mitchell wonders how many other tragedies have to happen before officials reconsider Vancouver’s annual fireworks bonanza. “Had fireworks been banned in Vancouver it might have prevented the death of this dog and the burning down of my house,” said Mitchell.\nSurrey, Richmond and North Vancouver have a standing ban on fireworks. Vancouver fire and rescue information officer Jonathan Gormick said most of the problems with fireworks are related to illegal and underground sales on sites such as Craigslist.\n“We’re keen on finding the safest regulation possible,” said Gormick. Working with mayor and council, Gormick said permitting, education and enforcement is the most effective strategy. Since the city’s permitting bylaw went into effect nine years ago, Gormick said people have been less likely to buy from underground sources and there has been close to a 75 per cent reduction in firework-related incidents.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T05:13:40Z","url":"https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/house-fire-dead-dog-spark-call-for-vancouver-to-ban-fireworks"}
{"text":"The US economy “remains strong”, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, told Congress on Tuesday as he signaled the central bank is on course to carry on gradually increasing interest rates in the coming months.\nIn his first congressional testimony since his appointment, Powell painted an upbeat picture of the country’s economic health and dismissed recent wobbles in the stock market.\n“Some of the headwinds the US economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,” said Powell. He told Congress his “personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December”.\nPowell managed to avoid controversy – one of the key aims of the Fed chair – ably deflecting politically charged questions about the US’s huge debts, the impact of Donald Trump’s recently announced $1.5tn tax cuts and income inequality. US stock markets barely moved during his testimony.\nThe Fed is expected to raise rates three times this year. “Further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment” of the Fed’s objectives of achieving full employment and controlling inflation, said Powell.\nThe rebound in the US jobs market which has continued uninterrupted for a record seven years finally seems to be lifting wages in the US after a long period of stagnation.\nThat news led to sharp sells-offs in stock markets that have broken records since Donald Trump’s election as investors bet the Fed would hike interest rates more quickly in order to dampen fears of rising inflation.\nPowell said that while assets were “high” he had no real concerns about systemic risks in the US economy at present.\nThe Fed “will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy” and allowing inflation to rise to the Fed’s target rate of 2%, Powell said.\nPowell’s testimony is the first from a Fed chairman since the passage of Trump’s tax cuts programme. The cuts have been cited as the impetus for bonuses at companies including American Airlines, AT&T and Disney.\nBut critics have pointed out that bonuses are not the same as wage rises and that the tax benefits to corporations dwarf the size of the benefits to individuals.\nPowell, a former investment banker for the Carlyle Group and longtime member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors under his predecessor Janet Yellen, was sworn in on 5 February as the Federal Reserve’s 16th chair.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T18:45:41Z","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/27/federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell-congress-testimony"}

{"text":"Parents with children in tow stagger onto a waiting train at Donaghmede Dart station. At Heuston, a group of mildly inebriated tourists are trying to navigate the Luas map, while across Dublin transport staff keep watch over the thousands who have descended on the city for St Patrick’s Day.\nDublin on St Patrick’s Day is a riot of green flags, shamrocks and alcohol, making it one of the busiest days of the year for staff and passengers on a transport system that has increasingly been grappling with concerns over anti-social behaviour and violent incidents.\n“Saturday nights and Paddy’s Day. They’re the two days you want to avoid,” says Dublin Bus driver Mark Maloney.\nAt 9.30am in Howth, it’s easy to forget there’s a festival at all. Yet as the train edges closer to the city, it becomes harder to ignore the shamrock hats, the fake ginger beards and the guitarist at Donaghmede delighting passengers with a rendition of Dirty Old Town.\nAt Clongriffin at 10.30am, there is little sign of the anti-social behaviour that has become a bugbear for the local community.\nThe number of violent or anti-social incidents on public transport is growing, with 407 complaints of anti-social behaviour on Irish trains last year, up from 246 the year before.\nFianna Fáil TD John Lahert cites the prevalence of a “low-grade, menacing type of behaviour” on Dublin trains. “Petty crime has become pretty much accepted,” he said.\nTommy Broughan, Independent TD for Dublin Bay North, described a “constant level of complaints” from constituents about anti-social behaviour and vandalism at the station.\n“We have asked for stations like Clongriffin and Donaghmede that there would be security so you wouldn’t come out on your own,” Broughan said. On busy days, like St Patrick’s Day, it’s worse. “People feel intimidated around festival times,” he said.\nIndeed, it was hard to ignore the strange emptiness of the large concrete station. With no staff presence, broken ticket machines and only a gaggle of French tourists for company, waiting there offered an eerie start to the day.\nHowever, as the train got closer to Dublin, the carriage became sweaty and cramped as children and families competed for space with adults out for a day of drinking.\nAs we alight at Connolly station, cans are cracked open as hundreds of people mill through the turnstiles while a group of gardaí look on.\nWhat differentiates St Patrick’s Day from an average day, aside from the crowds, is the sheer weight of security, stewards and gardaí on platforms, from Connolly Dart Station to the Smithfield Luas.\nFor numerous drivers and staff who spoke to The Irish Times, this is what made a difference.\nThe National Bus and Rail Union has long called for a transport police unit, similar to those found in the UK.\nHowever, John Power, chairman of the Railway Safety Advisory Council, suggested that it was not realistic to create a dedicated transport police force. Instead a “greater push towards community policing” could create significant progress, he said.\nSpecific figures for transport-related crimes on previous St Patrick’s weekends are not available, but a spokesman for Iarnród Éireann said two incidents were reported respectively at Heuston and at Pearse last year out of 100,000 journeys.\nToday, there was little sign of anything serious. Groups of teenagers singing and chanting on the Luas was as dramatic as it got during daylight, even if drinking was largely tolerated.\nOne Iarnród Éireann driver, who asked for his name not to be used, said the company will be praying it can get through the weekend without attention being focused on anti-social or violent incidents.\nDrivers, they said, often feel discouraged from reporting incidents that are increasingly seen as commonplace. Fears are echoed by staff across the system.\nColin Whelan, a Dublin bus driver, described how an unprovoked attack by a passenger left him off work for nearly four months. The attack, which saw the assailant shatter the protective glass in his cab, rendered Whelan shaken, covered in blood and forced to undergo tests for hepatitis, Aids and HIV.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T18:16:54Z","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/public-transport-on-st-patrick-s-day-a-riot-of-green-flags-shamrocks-and-alcohol-1.3829625"}

It talks to the user and asks them questions, just like a real person, and records their responses.\n\"There's this huge problem among immigration lawyers where the majority of their time is spent filling out forms rather than actually challenging the legal complexities of the case,\" Browder, whose grandmother fled the Holocaust, said in a phone call from California. \"So what this does, it takes down hundreds of details from individuals and automatically fills out\" the necessary forms.\nBuilt with the help of various lawyers and non-profits, the chatbot will ask everything from the applicant's age and nationality to whether they are \"afraid of being subject to torture\" in their home country.\nIn the US and Canada, it will help fill in asylum applications, while in the UK — where you have to apply in person — it assists in filling out asylum support forms. The student says he's also looking at expanding the bot to include Germany \"if I have time.\"\nDoNotPay began by challenging parking fines, but has since expanded into multiple other areas, including delayed flights, PPI, homelessness in the UK, and HIV legal advice.\n\"I originally started with parking tickets and delayed fights and all sorts of trivial consumer rights issues,\" Browder said, \"but then I began to be approached by these non-profits and lawyers who said the idea of automating legal services is bigger than just a few parking fines. So I've since tried to expand into something more humanitarian.\"\nDonald Trump's recent ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries has highlighted the plight of refugees and migrants, but Browder says the bot isn't a response to the new US president's actions. \"This was so long overdue. I started in the summer [of 2016] and although it seems more important now than ever it's actually not a reaction to recent political events.\"\nThe chatbot is launching on 12.01 AM, UK time, on Wednesday morning. It's free to use, and will remain that way, Browder said. \"It's completely free as a public service, I don't want to make some quick money.\"\nEven though DoNotPay has gone far beyond its original intentions, Browder said he has no plans to change its name. \"I think for better or worse, it's a brand everyone seems to know now,\" he said.\n\"I want to make it as recognisable as possible so people understand that they don't have to pay lawyers huge amounts of money for just copying and pasting documents.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-24T21:19:51Z","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-chatbot-donotpay-help-refugees-claim-asylum-us-canada-uk-joshua-browder-parking-fines-2017-3"}

{"text":"Kip Hagopian is the chairman of Maxim Integrated Products Inc., a semiconductor company, and was a founding general partner of Brentwood Associates, a venture capital and private-equity firm. Lee Ohanian is professor of economics at UCLA and a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Their op-ed appeared Oct. 29, 2012, in the Wall Street Journal.\nMany of those who assert that the rich don't pay their fair share of the nation's bills often point to how Social Security and Medicare are funded. For example, columnist Paul Krugman wrote on his New York Times blog in 2010 that \"the payroll tax is regressive, as are most state and local taxes, which largely offsets the progressivity of the income tax.\" And President Clinton's secretary of labor, Robert Reich, said in an October 2007 blog post, \"payroll taxes take a much bigger portion of the paychecks of lower-income Americans than of higher-income [Americans]. Viewed as a whole, the current tax system is quite regressive.\"\nOn the contrary, studies show that the Social Security and Medicare programs, viewed as a whole, are anything but regressive.\nThe payroll taxes that fund these programs are collected for the express purpose of providing income supplements and medical care during retirement. In the case of Social Security, earned income is taxed proportionately at 12.4% (split evenly between employee and employer) up to a cap that is currently set at $110,100. Those who assert that the Social Security tax is regressive note that the income cap results in a decline in taxes paid as a percentage of income as income rises above the cap. But this observation omits three critical facts.\nFirst, the amount of one's Social Security income at retirement is also capped. Second, higher-income workers receive less of a benefit as a percentage of their contributions than do lower-income workers. The payouts to retirees are, and are intended to be, redistributive. Third, Social Security income is subject to the income tax—and the income tax is progressive.\nGiven the design of Social Security, the only way the program could be regressive is if the mortality rate differences between the group of higher-income and lower-income workers were so large that higher-income people received greater lifetime benefits for each dollar contributed. But this is not the case, according to a 2009 study by the Social Security Administration's Office of Retirement and Disability Policy. Rather, the study concludes that \"Social Security is modestly progressive on a lifetime basis; currently, the program lies approximately halfway between paying a benefit directly proportional to lifetime taxable earnings and paying a flat dollar benefit to each retiree.\"\nIn the case of Medicare, the amount paid into the system—2.9% of income, split evenly between employee and employer—is proportionate to income and has no cap. So a person with a lifetime income of $5 million will pay five times as much into the system as a person with a lifetime income of $1 million.\nIn theory, therefore, the benefits provided by Medicare (paid health care) should be the same for each beneficiary. And like Social Security, lifetime benefits are affected by differences in mortality rates among different income groups (the poor tend to die younger). However, lower-income beneficiaries are more likely to become ill than higher-income beneficiaries and thus consume more benefits. Higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to privately insure or pay out of pocket in old age, thus reducing their demands on the system.\nSo what is the bottom line? Based on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, health economists Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Darius Lakdawalla of USC found that the poorest groups receive the most benefits at any given age, and that this advantage in benefits received significantly outweighs the fact that as a group, they die younger. The authors' 2006 study \"Does Medicare Benefit the Poor?\" was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Economics. On the whole, the authors conclude that \"Medicare is an extraordinarily progressive public program, in dollar terms or welfare terms.\"\nThe studies suggest that both of the payroll-tax systems are progressive, not regressive. Moreover, according to a July 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, entitled \"The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2008 and 2009,\" the entire U.S. federal tax system (including the earned-income tax, the various capital income taxes, the two types of payroll taxes, the corporate tax, and the excise tax) is also progressive.\nThose who assert that \"the rich\" do not pay their \"fair share\" seem to be ignoring these other facts: A study released in 2008 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported the U.S. federal income tax system is the most progressive of any of the 24 countries of its member nations. And an October 2011 report by the Tax Foundation noted that in 2009 the top 1% of U.S. earners—who earned 17% of the income—paid 37% of the taxes. The top 5% earned 32% of the income and paid 59% of the taxes. The bottom 50% paid 2.3% of taxes, and the bottom quintile received money back in the form of refundable tax credits.\nThose who would increase the marginal rates paid by the top income earners must confront the depressing effect that higher taxes will have on business creation and expansion—and on jobs. Giving a bigger piece of a smaller economic pie to lower-income earners is not likely to be in America's interest.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T06:13:47Z","url":"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/op-ed-240456"}

{"text":"Two officers of a company that operates three Manhattan hotels were indicted yesterday in a scheme to help homeless people fraudulently obtain welfare checks and split the money with the hotels.\nDistrict Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, who announced the indictments, said they resulted from a study of the three hotels announced last December by the city. He said his office was delayed in moving more quickly on the case because of difficulty in finding the welfare recipients involved in the purported scam.\nAlthough the investigation found that each of the hotels was receiving about twice as many welfare checks as it had occupied rooms, Mr. Morgenthau said the difficulty in tracking down homeless people believed to be involved in the purported scam resulted only in charges involving the Barbour. None of the 10 welfare recipients who were located in the search were charged because they are aiding the prosecution by giving testimony, officials said.\nCity welfare regulations require a person to provide a rent receipt to qualify for welfare, but officials at the city's Human Resources Administration said welfare recipients have never been formally referred by the agency to any of the three hotels.\nIndicted yesterday were the vice president of the operating company, Zisla Nikelsberg, 49 years old, of Brooklyn, and the secretary, Larry Heller, 27, of Staten Island. Both were charged with second-degree grand larceny and could face up to seven years in prison. The Hotel Barbour Operating Company was also charged with grand larceny. It faces a fine of up to $24,000 if convicted.\nAll the defendants pleaded not guilty yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan before Justice Harold J.

{"text":"In their first game since dropping out of the top five, the Irish delivered a redemption performance against Boston College, picking up a 50-point win over the Eagles while simultaneously moving one step closer to cementing Arike Ogunbowale’s legacy, as the senior guard passed current associate coach Beth Cunningham on the list of all-time scorers in the program.\nNo. 6 Notre Dame (23-2, 10-2 ACC) wasted no time in the opening quarter, taking an 8-0 lead in the first 1:21. However, the Eagles (14-11, 3-9) responded with back-to-back layups to cut the deficit in half before senior forward Jessica Shepard poured in four points of her own as well as a steal to spark another Irish run. With two minutes left in the quarter, Boston College knocked down four-straight free throws and a jumper to bring the deficit within single digits. While the second quarter proved to be more of the same, as the Irish outscored the Eagles 29-11, the real show came after halftime, when the Irish found their offensive rhythm, recording 37 points, while maintaining lockdown defense to hold Boston College to seven points in the quarter. Irish head coach Muffet McGraw liked how her team was able to energize the offense through opportunities in transition.\nIrish senior guard Arike Ogunbowale dribbles down the court during Notre Dame’s 97-70 win over Florida State on Feb. 10 at Purcell Pavilion.\nReturning to the court, the Eagles did their best to match the Irish, who outscored them 9-5 in the first three minutes. However, the real damage came in the remaining seven minutes, as Ogunbowale and co. went on a 26-2 run. This offensive performance saw all five starters contribute, as well as freshman guard Abby Prohaska. The reserve guard stepped up in the absence of fellow rookie guard Jordan Nixon, who injured her hamstring during warmups. Prohaska finished with four points, two rebounds and two steals.\nMcGraw credited this impressive performance in part due to the absence of Boston College junior starting guard Taylor Ortlepp, who was out of the lineup with an ankle injury. Although Ortlepp only contributed three points in the Eagle’s 29-point loss to the Irish on Jan. 20, she has proven to be a solid leader, averaging 11.6 points per game to go along with her 35.6 percent shooting from long range.\nHaving built a 59-point lead, the Irish lost some of their momentum in the final frame, allowing 18 points — as many as they did in the entire first half combined. However, it did show glimmers of what’s to come for the Irish in the years ahead, most notably in the form of Prohaska and sophomore forward Danielle Patterson, who tallied six points, seven rebounds — four of which were offensive — and a steal on the night. All five starters finished in double digits, led by Ogunbowale’s 23 to go along with her seven assists and three steals, all while only committing two turnovers. Those 23 points brought her career-total to 2,324, just 34 points short of passing 2013 graduate Skylar Diggins-Smith.\nMcGraw didn’t seem surprised by this achievement, saying it wasn’t even on their radar when Ogunbowale returned at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nWith only four games remaining in the regular season, the Irish will take the weekend off before heading on a road trip to Raleigh, North Carolina, to take on No. 12 North Carolina State on Monday.

{"text":"DPR members Jim Ragsdale, Diane Kane, Angeles Liera and pro tem chair Mike Costello discuss condo conversion projects.\nDuring the Jan. 10 meeting of the La Jolla Development Permit Review committee (DPR), board members voted unanimously to form a research subcommittee that will look into the consequences of condo conversion in the neighborhoods south of Pearl Street.\n“The issue with the condo conversions in this particular neighborhood is that you’ve got two units on a lot and the proposals we’re getting are essentially lot-splits that put an imaginary line across the lot, making two smaller lots that don’t comply with what is zoned in the code for that area,” said board member Diane Kane during her presentation on the topic.\nIn the past year, DPR members have reviewed three condo conversions of existing dwelling units, two of them in the area south of Pearl Street (7432-7436 Fay Ave. and 7435-7437 Eads Ave.) and a third in WindanSea, the second area where trustees have identified the problem (247-249 Kolmar St.). A fourth condo conversion heard by the board in the last 12 months was a map waiver for 7569-7571 Hershel Ave. (just north of Pearl), a three-apartment building under construction at the time, with which trustees had no problems.\nThe 7435-7437 Eads Ave. map waiver project received DPR’s approval in December, but it was pulled from the La Jolla Community Planning Association’s agenda and it will be heard in full review 6 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 2 at the Rec Center, 615 Prospect St.\nApplicants Sarah Horton and Tim Golba explain the details of the Caplan Residence project to DPR members.\n“The question I asked is why these were condo conversions and not a lot-splits,” Kane continued, adding the answer is that the lots in question are 5,000 square feet, and the minimum size for a lot in the zone is 3,000 square feet, so they can’t be split in two.\nKane said she has concerns about the applicability of the condo conversion map waiver in these cases. “This planning tool is totally legitimate for single buildings, multi-unit apartment buildings that are being turned into condos or for larger multi-family units where you have common area. But when you only have two units on a lot, and they are separate, and they share no property in common, it doesn’t seem to meet the requirements for a condo. So, why is the City allowing the condo conversion process to be used for this particular situation?” she elaborated.\nThe City has mechanisms in place to keep affordable housing within the Coastal Zone, but those can be waived by a contribution of an in-lieu fee to the San Diego Housing Trust Fund, and most developers in La Jolla pay rather than give up units for low- or medium-income families.\nWith the added concern of residents, DPR members agreed that something has to be done to better serve the community when reviewing condo conversion projects. Trustee Liera proposed perusing the San Diego Municipal Code for requirements “dangling around” in different sections and making a checklist for applicants, so they’d know what to bring in when they present to DPR.\nThe committee unanimously approved a motion to form a condo-conversion research subcommittee whose ad-hoc members are trustees Kane, Liera and Brian Will. The issue will be discussed further in upcoming DPR meetings.\nArchitect Tim Golba’s presentation about a demolition and construction of a 4,302-square-foot, two-story single-family residence at 1418 Park Row received unanimous approval from DPR. After a preliminary review on Dec. 20, the applicant granted some of the committee’s requests, such as replacing the rooftop stucco band for a rail, lowering the front fence to three feet tall, redoing the driveway and adding glass to the garage door.\n— DPR next meets 4 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 14 at the La Jolla Rec Center, 615 Prospect St.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T16:45:54Z","url":"https://www.lajollalight.com/news/sd-condo-conversions-20170117-story.html"}
{"text":"Everybody knows the parable of the man who built his house on sand. When the storm came, all his hard work and investment was washed away.\nIf the gospel were being written today, perhaps it would be called the parable of the man who built his house on riparian land.\nThe images we have seen of expensive buildings being knocked down and cleared away are certainly shocking. It seems such a waste.\nAnd of course, in the parable, it is slightly different, for it is the forces of nature that come and wash away the man’s house, not the forces of some government agency as has been seen in recent times.\nCouldn’t they be made to pay a fine instead? Couldn’t the building be repossessed or nationalised? Could this situation have been avoided?\nWell, perhaps. The truth is that this situation could have been avoided - by not building on riparian land without permission.\nIt’s as simple as that. No one just starts building without some sort of plan.\nNow the Government has shown us very clearly that plans have to be legal, or they won't be very good plans.\nIt is indeed a pity to destroy perfectly good buildings. But destroying them is the simplest way to enforce the rule of law and make sure illegal constructions do not happen again.\nPeople need to know that when they break the law, it will cost them more time and money in the long run.\nThe parable of the man who built his house on sand is designed to make you think about the difference between making sure you have the right foundations in place and simply taking shortcuts through life.\nSome of these enthusiastic riparian land builders would do well to read it.\nPeople who built without the correct permissions were taking shortcuts and building on poor foundations.\nAnd that is the reason their buildings are now tumbling down, one after the other. They have only themselves to blame.\nSometimes in emergencies, you just have to get on with whatever needs doing, whether you have the paperwork or not.\nBut when it is just a case of chasing profits or saving a bit of time, I’m sorry; you either follow the rules or don’t complain when your house comes crashing down.\nThe State is there to be the rock on which citizens build. And whenever you cheat it, you turn it into sand. We should endeavour to make the State a gift that every generation receives from their elders.\nTo do that, we need to make sure that the State is a rock we can rely on. And that is why the illegal buildings needed to come down.\nThis parable about building a house is not just true for a literal house or a dream or a project, but it is even more true for building our Government and public institutions.\nFor many people, particularly the young, we think of these institutions as already fixed, and more dead than alive. But the truth is, our public institutions are made of people. People who are alive, People like you and me.\nAnd therefore they are fluid and always capable of change and progress, and adapting to new ways of thinking and living. But for this to happen we need to be engaged citizens and to hold them to account.\nWe have a unique chance right now in the war on graft. Public opinion is strongly in favour of the anti-corruption drive that President Uhuru Kenyatta has pursued. But the moment will pass.\nWe need to make the most of this moment of goodwill and public attention to put the foundations in place and make sure that we are building on a solid basis for the future, no matter who is in power.\nWe have a moment right now to get behind reforms to make sure that this cleansing of certain corrupt individuals is not just a surface pruning that allows the graft to grow back even stronger next year.\nWe need to make sure the structures are in place so that zero-corruption becomes the norm, the expectation and the easy route for everyone in public life because that is the number one route to improving our economy and making our country live up to its full potential.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T20:53:23Z","url":"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001294701/parable-of-man-who-built-on-riparian-land"}

{"text":"Unfortunately, Sir James Robertson’s plan succeeded partly because leading southern politicians, especially Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Chief Obafemi Awolowo, failed to put in abeyance their personal egos and radioactive Igbo-versus-Yoruba rivalry in order to present a united front against Robertson and Balewa. That said, as Premiers of their respective regions, Dr. Azikiwe, Chief Awolowo and Alhaji Ahmadu Bello (whose tenure as Premier of the northern region was tragically terminated during the first military coup in January 15, 1966) performed creditably by implementing programmes that benefitted a significant percentage of the population.\nBut Azikiwe and Awolowo were by far more attuned to the institution of democracy than the jihadist-oriented Sardauna because of their exposure to solid western education and secular democratic values, whereas Ahmadu Bello was hampered by his limited academic credentials, serious educational disadvantage of the northern region generally as well as by his fixation to outdated Islamic weltanschauung and way of life.\nIndeed, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the most powerful northern politician of the First Republic, never really believed in the concept of a united democratic Nigeria. He single-mindedly pursued a northernisation agenda such that that he preferred filling vacant positions in the northern region’s civil service and educational institutions where qualified northerners were unavailable with foreigners on contract basis rather than employ southerners, particularly the Igbo. His narrow negative triumphalist approach to nation-building is evident in an address he delivered to his caliphate constituency less than two weeks after independence. In it, Bello insisted vehemently that Nigeria “should be an estate of our great-grandfather, Uthman Dan Fodio.\nChief Obafemi Awolowo also articulated a rational philosophical roadmap for Nigeria. In projecting his vision of secular democracy for the country, Awolowo emphasised the pursuit of “…equal opportunities for every Nigerian; equality under the law; extermination of ethnic hegemony; dethronement of mediocrity wherever it exists; guaranteeing for every Nigerian no matter his place of birth or state of origin equal access to the good things of life.\nWe can succeed provided we allow ourselves to be guided by this great principle: ‘The glory of a ruler is the welfare of every one of his people.’ ” From the foregoing, it is evident that by amalgamating the predominantly Muslim population of northern Nigeria with the south where Christianity and western education had made tremendous impact on the various peoples there, the prospects of democracy were not encouraging. Historians of Nigerian politics tend to neglect the fact that Islam, the dominant religion of northerners, is fundamentally incompatible with democracy and human rights.\nThis point needs to be brought to limelight for a proper understanding of the challenges in entrenching viable democratic institutions and also the democratically aberrant dispositions of leading northern Muslim politicians since the creation of Nigeria as a geopolitical entity by Britain. Islam has never really favoured democratic tendencies, a fact King Fahd of Saudi Arabia frankly acknowledged some time ago when he affirmed that the democratic system is not suitable for the Muslim-dominated middle-east, that the system of free elections is not suitable for his country.\nThe political system the British met on ground in the northern region was the rustic emirate system in which politics and Islam were blended together to form a theocracy headed by the Sultan of Sokoto. In the south, particularly in the defunct eastern region sometimes misleadingly described as “acephalous,” most of the autochthonous communities had evolved some kind of Republican political systems anchored on key cultural groupings, whereas traditionally the Yoruba operated a kind of monarchical arrangement that had checks and balances alien to the emirate system in the north.\nNow, for members of the core northern political establishment, the democratic doctrine of separation of religion and state is a western concept which has no legitimacy in the Holy Koran and sharia law. Additionally, pious Muslims believe strongly, as a matter of religious conviction, that legitimate authority comes from Allah alone, and the ruler derives his power from Allah and the holy law, not from the people. The individual owes absolute obedience to the ruler because of the divine right of kings. Hence, a typical northern politician cannot really genuinely espouse democratic values unless he or she pays lip service to or jettisons the totalitarian principles in the Holy Koran and sharia law.\nAs devout Muslims, Ahmadu Bello and Tafawa Balewa must have felt the essential tension generated by their commitment to Islam and the need to operate according to the requirements of democratic governance in a modern nation-state. It is in this light that one can understand why, at the initial stage, they were very reluctant to embrace the concept of democracy under the umbrella of “One Nigeria” and also why northern leaders regularly resorted to threats of secession during the constitutional conferences convened to fashion out an appropriate constitutional framework for post-colonial Nigeria.\nDemocracy is “government of the people, by the people and for the people,” which means that representatives of the citizens in both the executive and the legislature derive their legitimate authority from the people, not from a certain deity believed to exist whose commands believers must obey unquestioningly.\nTherefore, although pioneer frontline Nigerian politicians inherited parliamentary democracy from Britain, that inheritance was deeply flawed partly because the British handed power over to the Northern People’s Congress (NPC), whose leaders, as devout Muslims, were wedded more to the rigidities and insularity of Islamic theocracy than to the tenets of modern democracy, unlike their Christian southern counterparts whose political outlook were shaped by a deep appreciation of democratic culture and values.\nThe implications flowing from the dissonance in political consciousness between Sir Ahmadu Bello and his cohorts in the north and Dr. Azikiwe and other leading southern politicians on the democratic trajectory of post-independent Nigeria are obvious. As we observed earlier, Dr. Azikiwe and Chief Awolowo envisaged for Nigeria a democratic political system or arrangement that would cater for the welfare of all Nigerians without discrimination; but their northern counterparts were more interested in replacing external British colonialism with a pernicious internal Fulani caliphate version by subjugating the middle-belt and the south. The antagonism between these contrasting political outlooks constitute both a remote and proximate cause of the political problems that led to the eventual collapse of the First Republic.\nA plausible case can be made that British colonial administrators deliberately structured Nigeria, with the co-operation of the dominant northern political elite, to ensure that the north dominates the south after independence. That is why they configured the country lopsidedly such that the north constituted over two-thirds of Nigeria’s land mass. Henry Bretton in his work, Power and Stability in Nigeria: The Politics of Decolonisation, affirmed that “the very construction of the northern region, in the form in which it entered the era of independence, represents one of the greatest acts of gerrymandering in history.” Naturally, the overriding intention of British imperialism for Nigeria was to protect the economic interest of Britain; it had nothing to do with the creation of a viable democratic country.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T01:41:39Z","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/03/the-death-of-democracy-in-nigeria-a-coroners-inquest-3/"}
{"text":"Investors in Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. saw new options become available this week, for the May 18th expiration.\nInvestors in Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LXRX - Get Report) saw new options become available this week, for the May 18th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LXRX options chain for the new May 18th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.\nThe put contract at the $8.00 strike price has a current bid of 20 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $8.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $7.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LXRX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $8.36/share today.\nBecause the $8.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.50% return on the cash commitment, or 17.55% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example above is 118%.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $8.36) to be 44%.

{"text":"Did van Gogh cut off his ear because his brother was engaged?\nAMSTERDAM - New evidence has bolstered a theory that Vincent van Gogh's psychotic break on Dec 23, 1888, may have been set off by the news that his brother, Theo, had become engaged to be married.\nAuthor Martin Bailey writes about the findings, based on a thorough examination of family letters, in his new book, Studio Of The South: Van Gogh In Provence, which will be published on Thursday (Nov 3) in Britain.\nThe artist cut off most of his ear during a psychotic episode about 12 hours after he learned of the engagement, which is \"not something you would do if you welcomed the news, by any means\", Bailey said in a phone interview on Tuesday.\nIn the past, most scholars have credited the mental breakdown to a fight van Gogh had that same day with painter Paul Gauguin, a friend of his. Bailey believes the engagement news to be a much more significant disturbance than the fight, and said van Gogh's fears of abandonment may have been stirred.\n\"Vincent feared that he would then 'lose' Theo, his closest companion,\" Bailey wrote in the book. \"He was equally worried that his brother might withdraw the financial support which had enabled him to devote his life to art. All this was threatened by the unexpected appearance of a fiancée.\"\nBailey, a London-based art correspondent for The Art Newspaper and an independent curator who has mounted van Gogh exhibitions at the Barbican Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Scotland/Compton Verney, previously posited his theory in an article for The Art Newspaper in 2009 and in his 2013 book The Sunflowers Are Mine: The Story Of Van Gogh's Masterpiece. But his new book provides more evidence, he said, based on an analysis of previously unpublished family correspondence.\n\"I'm even more convinced that he did indeed know about the engagement on the morning of Dec 23,\" he said.\nOther van Gogh experts are circumspect about the evidence. Ms Nienke Bakker, a curator of van Gogh paintings at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam - which owns the largest collection of the artist's works - said that it's impossible to know whether Bailey's theory is correct, because the letter that van Gogh received on Dec 23 doesn't exist any more.\n\"It might have contained the news of Theo's engagement, but this cannot be proven,\" she wrote in an email. \"It is equally possible that Theo only informed Vincent of his marriage plans when he visited his brother in hospital - thus after the ear incident.\"\nMr Sjraar van Heugten, a van Gogh expert and the author of several books about the artist, said, \"It seems fair to me that this may have played a crucial role, but it came on top of the increasingly difficult situation with Gauguin.\" He added: \"I give more weight to that, but the dramatic events were probably the result of several tensions.\"\nScholars have been puzzling over the details of van Gogh's time in Arles, in Provence, for the 126 years since the artist's death, because while he was living there from February 1888 to May 1889, he experienced both the peak of his artistic career and the beginning of his mental decline. He had his first significant psychotic breakdown there, according to a recent conference by physicians and art historians in Amsterdam earlier this year to discuss the case. It is also where he was hospitalised for the first time.\nBailey observes that, just a half day before van Gogh cut off his ear, he received a letter from Paris that may have contained the news that Theo was engaged to Johanna Bonger, known as Jo. Although he could not confirm the precise contents of that letter, which has been lost, he was able to find evidence that Bonger received a telegram of congratulations on Dec 23 from her older brother Henry - which confirmed that Henry had received the news of the engagement - shortly after receiving the announcement letter from Bonger.\nBecause Vincent and Henry were both older brothers of the betrothed parties, and had the same social standing within the family, it would seem customary to inform them both at the same time, Bailey reasons.\nEven if van Gogh had heard about the engagement on that day, however, Ms Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum said: \"The question would remain as to whether it played any part in his self-injury. It is a matter of speculation that cannot be proved one way or the other.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-24T04:41:22Z","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/did-van-gogh-cut-off-his-ear-because-his-brother-was-engaged"}

{"text":"Reseller hosting businesses rent backend server space from larger companies.\n2 Can You Make Money Being a Web-hosting Reseller?\nWeb hosting companies earn money by selling server space to individuals and businesses. While some hosting companies own their own servers, many new hosting ventures begin by renting server space from another provider. This is known as \"reseller hosting.\" Typically, the larger company provides \"backend\" service that is not visible to the end user, and a reseller hosting business re-brands and sells the available server space.\nCreate a general business plan for the hosting business. Decide which market niche the hosting services will fill. For instance, some hosting companies compete by offering basic hosting at very low prices, while others offer website building services or specialized software support. Establish a list of services and prices that will be offered by the company. If many different services will be offered, split them into several different packages and pricing levels.\nDetermine what technical support options the company will offer. Around the clock customer support via phone can be attractive to customers, but requires more staff members than basic e-mail technical support. Decide if the reseller hosting business will use in-house tech support personnel or if support from an outside contractor is required instead.\nForm a legal business entity for the hosting company. Choose from a sole proprietorship, limited liability company or corporation. The first option is the easiest to create, while the last two options offer better liability protection. Visit the local Secretary of State or County Clerk’s office to fill out the appropriate forms for the business entity.\nSelect a backend hosting provider that offers reseller packages. Check the websites and available packages from several different companies, and find one that meets the needs of the general business plan. Compare the available storage space and bandwidth numbers from different companies. Check to see if the hosting provider will offer technical support to your end users, or if you must provide this directly. New hosting businesses usually start with a small and relatively inexpensive reseller hosting package, and expand to a larger package once the company begins to grow.\nChoose a payment processing solution for the new hosting business. Compare the costs and features of a bank merchant account, and internet-based payment processors. Verify that the payment service is able to process several different brands of credit cards, and is able to support recurring customer billing for monthly subscribers.\nCreate an internet presence for the new hosting company. Register a domain name that is unique and easy to remember. Build a website to be placed on this domain or hire a design service to create the site. Many backend hosting service providers provide customizable site templates for this purpose or offer professional design services. Present the available hosting packages and prices on the site, using the general business plan as a guide.\nMarket the new hosting business. Contact local businesses and offer the hosting services for their website; use a discounted trial rate as incentive. Network with local web design companies, freelancers and marketing companies to offer hosting to their clients. Advertise in publications such as newspapers, or using online pay-per-click advertising on search engines such as Google and Yahoo.\nMonitor and administer the reseller hosting business to prevent site downtime and keep customers satisfied. Use the backend hosting control panel to check bandwidth and storage amounts frequently and upgrade to a larger package with the hosting provider if needed. Respond quickly to customer questions or complaints, and consult with the backend hosting provider to solve any technical issues promptly.\nAries, Benjamin. \"How to Run a Reseller Hosting Company.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/run-reseller-hosting-company-25300.html.

{"text":"It recently dawned on me that it has been nearly nine long years since my wife and children moved back to India. Living on my own hasn’t been easy. While mundane, everyday issues like food had understandably been the first and foremost concern, there are a myriad of things that you miss when you find yourself suddenly divested of the emotional support system that loved ones offer, especially in times of distress.\nI nearly went crazy in the beginning. Waking up on my own and getting ready for work in the deafening silence of an empty house and being greeted by a deserted, lifeless home on return had been incredibly depressing.\nI would stay up late at night as I found it impossible to sleep. My old problem of insomnia got progressively worse. If I somehow managed to doze off, I found it hard to wake up in the morning for work.\nOver time, I somehow managed to come to terms with my splendid isolation, repeatedly telling myself to pull myself together. However, without my realising it, the new ‘bachelor’ lifestyle had begun to take its emotional and physical toll on my health. I really piled on the pounds as I sought to find comfort and solace in food and ate junk that Indian and Pakistani hotels usually serve.\nPerhaps you never recover from the emotional shock and sense of loss – although in my case it was supposed to have been a temporary separation. My children needed to move to attend college. They were supposed to come back soon.\nHowever, I realised shortly as well as they did that it was not going to happen anytime soon. They had not left the nest to return. Initially apprehensive and nervous, my children have come to love and enjoy the freedom, and the hustle and bustle of life back home. Now whenever they come to visit me in Dubai, they appear bored and cannot wait to go back.\nThe same goes for their mother. She is seemingly at peace with herself and enjoys the chaotic certainty of life in India, with its myriad challenges as well as small pleasures. Meanwhile, I have found myself feeling increasingly lonely and depressed, and like a stranger at home whenever I visit India.\nI have never been very social by nature. Far from it. I love my “me time”, as they say in the West, and like spending time with myself. I hate the company of the endlessly blabbering kind. However, even solitary, shy animals like me do miss and pine for the warmth of human company and kindred spirits. There’s a void and emptiness in and around me that nothing seems to fill.\nI have tried keeping myself busy. I watch TV – indeed too much of it, I must admit. Having been a voracious, compulsive reader all my life, I know there is nothing like a good book to beat ennui and loneliness. Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience, said Mark Twain, are key to an ideal life.\nHowever, diversions like reading, TV and music may temporarily help the lonely, but they can never truly be a substitute for that priceless gift called human company, especially of those who you love. Besides, you know what Albert Einstein thought of reading after a certain age? Reading diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking, said the genius.\nThere can never be “too much” reading. But, yes, it is not possible to argue with Einstein’s point about being too dependent on the “received wisdom” of giants like him and not thinking for ourselves. This is perhaps why the Quran repeatedly implores us to think and contemplate on the world around us, where we came from, and where we are headed.\nReturning to the issue at hand, hopelessly missing my family and wallowing in self-pity, I often wonder how my son must be dealing with his own share of blues and homesickness. He moved to the US a couple of years ago to pursue his dream of a foreign university degree.\nLiving all by himself on the other side of the world– he needs to change at least three flights from Hyderabad in India to get to his destination in the American South – the experience couldn’t have been easy for him. Especially for someone as painfully shy and introverted as him.\nGrowing up, he was so emotionally attached to me that he would stand right next to me, shoulder to shoulder, even in his teens whenever we prayed together in the mosque. Now, he is all grown up to face the world on his own.\nI guess these are the rites of passage that we all must negotiate on our own. Each one of us must carry his own cross. In the words of the Quran, “No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another”. Being the protective parents that we are, we worry ourselves sick about our children, without realising that they are perhaps emotionally stronger and better equipped to deal with the world.\nCome to think of it, it is not just me who has to battle these “existential dilemmas”. There are millions and millions like me in this part of the world living thousands of kilometres from home, toiling daily so their families and loved ones back home have the shot at a better life than they had.\nI know of people who have spent more than 30 to 40 years in the Gulf – more than two-thirds of their lives – and yet remain strangers in their adopted countries. Some of them arrived by ships and even by traditional dhows when the Gulf El Dorado was still in its infancy.\nMany of them spend all their lives diligently saving their dirhams and dinars, often at a great cost to themselves. They live in shared apartments, sometimes six to eight in a room, dreaming of going home “soon”. Many of them have missed seeing their children grow up in their crucial formative years, sharing small, everyday pleasures of life with their families. All this to ensure that their families back home live in comfort.\nIn many cases though, their hard-earned money is squandered without a thought to the sweat and blood spent in earning it. Many of these valiant soldiers die far from their loved ones and without their dreams ever being realised.\nIt is their sweat and blood that have literally built the rich petrodollar economies of the Gulf, not to mention the colossal and seldom-acknowledged contribution their remittances have made to the economies back home in South Asia and elsewhere.\nThe heaven-kissing towers and high-rises of Dubai, Doha and Jeddah wouldn’t have been possible without the sheer hard work and dedication of multitudes of humble men, the overwhelming majority of them from the Subcontinent.\nThis is why I have always believed that the extraordinary lives and struggles of my fellow travellers are nothing short of a noble jihad. If jihad means striving for a noble cause and putting your life on the line for a higher purpose, then these men and women have been doing just that.\nWho says I am alone? I am surrounded by noble and selfless men and women. I am in the presence of greatness.\nThe writer is an award-winning journalist and editor.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T18:28:24Z","url":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/388426-the-price-of-gulf-dreams"}

{"text":"We've spent a lot of time covering IK Multimedia's line of iOS accessories for guitarists. And with good reason: the original iRig for the iPhone and iPod Touch was one of the first dedicated music accessories for the mobile musician, helping to launch a whole cottage industry of hardware and apps that transformed iOS devices from consumption to creative devices. And with the recently released iRig Keys, IK has extended that line to keyboardists as well.\nThe iRig Keys is a 37-key mini keyboard and MIDI controller. It works as a Core MIDI device for iOS and a USB class compliant for seamless use with any app or software which supports MIDI devices on both Mac and PC. The device is complete with wheels for modulation and pitch bend and has an input jack for a sustain pedal, along with various buttons for changing octaves or volume. All of the keys are velocity-sensitive, meaning that a lighter touch will result in a softer notes while the opposite is true when hammering out chords.\nI tried out the iRig Keys on both my iPad Mini and Mac. Using the Lightning adapter worked great and the Garageband App detected the keyboard, no problem. I pulled up a previous project and started playing with the pianos, organs and other MIDI instruments Garageband offers. It was a truly plug and play experience that let me focus on making music and, again, brought out the fun that Garageband is capable of. The velocity sensitivity wasn't as good as on full-sized keyboards, and certainly those with fully weighted keys, but those complaints must be taken with a grain of salt; there is plenty of variability for making expressive performances.\nIK Multimedia also publishes two great apps that serve as companions for the iRig Keys. The first is SampleTank which contains over 500 instruments over 16 categories including drum samplers, a wide range of electronic and orchestral instruments. SampleTank is free with various instrument packs unlockable with in-app purchases. The second app is the iGrand Piano, which has the most faithful piano samples I've ever heard on iOS. With pianos ranging from Classical and Grand Pianos to various uprights and even a fun Saloon piano, the app offers an incredible amount of range. Each piano is customizable with options for adjusting volume, ambience, and lid position and the automatic release of keys when not using an expression pedal are phenomenal. Both apps are compatible with the iRig Keys along with a dedicated iOS-compatible MIDI adapter called the iRig MIDI, so you can bring your own MIDI keyboard if you'd like.\nOverall, I feel that IK Multimedia has a home run on their hands with the iRig Keys and the supporting apps they've created. They're smartly designed, work well together and they sound incredible. Any keyboardist who's been jealous of all of the products out there catering to their guitarist friends finally have an equally portable solution for practicing, writing and performing.\nWired: Extremely portable and feature rich with velocity-sensitive mini keys and convenient buttons to activate features in equally rich first-party apps. Flexible use with both iOS and Mac or PC.\nTired: All plastic construction has some flex and feels a bit cheap. Unlocking the full potential of the apps is relatively costly. Separate iPhone and iPad apps.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T10:45:53Z","url":"https://www.wired.com/2012/12/irig-keys/"}
{"text":"I imagine that Ellis would find this reaction delightful. That it is uttered by a purebred coastal elite with a crush on A.O.C. and a refrigerator full of overpriced organic produce would make it all the more delicious.\nBecause here is the caricatured target of Ellis’s new book: a millennial who borrows many of his cultural opinions from woke Twitter; who experienced something close to shell shock when Robert Mueller’s report was finally completed and impeachment proceedings did not immediately commence; and who — sin of sins, as far as the author is concerned — confuses aesthetic differences with moral failing.\nEllis has been a public bad boy since 1985, when his debut novel, “Less Than Zero,” was published while he was still a college student. In those days, the author’s vices were obnoxiousness and large quantities of cocaine. Now he is sober. And the obnoxiousness has migrated, naturally, to a podcast and a Twitter feed.\nNow, at least in theory, snowflakes on both coasts in withdrawal from Rachel Maddow’s nightly Kremlinology lesson can purchase a whole book to inspire paroxysms of rage. “White” — even the title is a trigger — is a veritable thirst trap for the easily microaggressed.\nIt’s all here. Rants about Trump derangement syndrome; MSNBC; #MeToo; safe spaces. He thinks “Moonlight” only won the Oscar for best picture over “La La Land” because voting for it could be seen as a “rebuke to Trump.” He thinks that Black Lives Matter is a morally significant movement, but says its “lurching, unformed aesthetic” is why it never reached a wide audience. Had the “millennial mess” mimicked the look of the Black Panthers, he suggests, it would have taken off. I’m not exaggerating. Speaking of Black Panthers — yes, you guessed it — the author thinks that movie was insanely overhyped. It will not escape reader notice that the author of a book called “White” happens to be particularly fixated on black culture.\nEllis recently told The Times that “this is kind of a book for a Bret Easton Ellis completist.” Perhaps he is right that superfans will love to hear him go on for pages about “American Psycho” being transferred from page to stage, where it closed after two months and lost $14 million. I did not.\nBut one suspects that his editor must be one. Nothing else justifies seven pages on Charlie Sheen’s 2011 breakdown. Ellis summons more detail and color about Alex Gibney’s 2015 HBO documentary about Frank Sinatra (three pages) than he does in the two paragraphs he dedicates to snorting coke and talking about race with Jean-Michel Basquiat on a random October afternoon at the Odeon in 1987 — an anecdote that any person with a pulse would be interested in.\nEllis told The Times Literary Supplement that this book was “a lament from a disillusioned Gen X-er” and I think to read it as anything more than a sustained wail would be a waste of energy.\nThat is not to say that I don’t share some of Ellis’s bugbears.\nI think those writers who boycotted PEN for honoring the surviving staffers of Charlie Hebdo are moral midgets. I think it’s a very bad sign about where we are as a culture when friendships are unable to survive elections or the appointment of Supreme Court justices.\nIndeed, many of the topics Ellis blithely skates over in this ranting, stream-of-consciousness book would be rich fodder for a real analysis of the Great Awokening and its excesses. On the face of it, it would seem Ellis would be the ideal person to write it.\nHe was canceled decades before canceling became a thing. It was November 1990 and Simon & Schuster was set to release “American Psycho,” Ellis’s anticipated third novel, until it caved in the face of criticism, much of it internal. “The noise from the offended was too loud,” Ellis writes of the episode — a concise phrase diagnosing our current cultural malady.\nBack then, outrage had not yet become our dominant mode. A more prestigious publishing house swooped in within 48 hours and “American Psycho” became a best seller. Today, young-adult novels deemed politically or culturally insensitive are pulped before they are even put out.\nAnd one of the earliest casualties of our fun-deficient, conformist age (Ellis is entirely right about this) has been the intellectual gadfly. Ellis is one of them.\nYet he refuses to own the role he has chosen. “I was never good at realizing what might offend someone anyway,” he writes.

The scorching summer has been blamed for sending the company’s share price plummeting.\nThe hot weather meant many traditional Thomas Cook customers spent June and July enjoying the sunshine at home instead of booking holidays abroad. Mr Fankhauser said the company’s recent trading performance was “clearly disappointing” and investors shared this glum assessment.\nThomas Cook makes all its profit in the summer when its customers in northern Europe, including Britain, Germany and Scandinavia go on holiday, mainly to warmer destinations in southern Europe such as Spain, Turkey and Greece.\nSo Thomas Cook’s perfect British summer is damp and dreary.

{"text":"Omri Barzilay is a co-founder of Propcy.\nThe real estate rental market is a highly localized, relationship-based industry driven largely by individuals living and working in their own cities, causing many to acknowledge the longstanding difficulty of streamlining disruption to this market.\nIn recent years, however, that hasn’t stopped a multitude of innovators from seeking novel ways to improve the process’s efficiency.\nIf early innovators like Zillow and Trulia primarily entailed bringing real estate data online, newer innovators harness data not only to improve analytics for landlords, but also to improve efficiency for apartment seekers. This becomes more important as New York City, for instance, begins to see the start of an expected surge in rental apartments — more than 38,000 market-rate rental apartments, mostly in Brooklyn and Queens, are expected to be completed over the next three years.\nWith the advent of new technologies, the market has begun to shift nearly every aspect of the rental process, from leasing applications to communications with landlords and agents to payment processing.\nAs rentals become commoditized and fewer people are satisfied being tied down to static assets, a number of players have sought to empower potential renters in new ways. The first, and perhaps most obvious, is enabling rental without a broker. New York-based real estate startup Oliver, for example, launched in 2015 to serve as a platform that cuts out the middleman and seamlessly connects renters with apartments.\nWhat this means in practice is that by aggregating real-time rental inventory directly from property managers and landlords, rather than through third-parties, the Oliver app enables renters not only to browse and filter listings as could be done on other platforms, but also to schedule showings at the tap of a button using an in-app calendar feature. Rezi, an earlier-stage New York startup, also saves time by automatically scheduling multiple apartment visits to fit its users’ schedules.\nOthers have invested resources in improving the process for brokers themselves. Nestio, a residential leasing and marketing platform, streamlines the leasing process using cloud-based software, which enables listings to be shared, leads to be tracked and clients to be managed in one easy-to-use platform.\nAn increasing number of startups, both small and large, are empowering renters.\nEarlier this year, Naked Apartments, a website that optimizes how brokers can proactively approach potential and current clients with appropriate, targeted listings, became Zillow’s fifth consumer-brand acquisition, with the shared goal of using data analytics to bring transparency to New York’s real estate landscape for brokers.\nAs agents spend less time at their desk and more time closing on rental deals via mobile applications, DotLoop has also focused on automating more redundant tasks by allowing agents to upload important documents, negotiate transactions and get bank-approved e-signatures in a single platform.\nOthers are playing matchmaker in different ways: by connecting potential roommates to each other. Roomi, which raised $4 million in seed funding led by DCM Ventures and already boasts more than 375,000 users in North America, as well as smaller market players like EasyRoommate, make it simpler for renters to find and connect with compatible roommates, whether renting an extra room in an apartment or searching together for an apartment.\nOther startups are seeking to disrupt the traditional corporate housing and long-term stay marketplace. Startups like HomeSuite, an online marketplace that removes the hassle from finding furnished housing, aggregates not just long-term but also short-term inventory, geared toward individuals who might previously have focused their searches on more standard month-to-month property managers. In doing so, they are filling the grey area between Craigslist and Airbnb, serving the needs of individuals looking for something more permanent than a vacation rental yet more transient than a typically longer lease commitment.\nDisruption hasn’t been limited to the search process. Even payment solutions and mobile are being integrated into newer platforms by companies like RadPad, an end-to-end photo-based rental marketplace aiming to become an A-to-Z platform for renters and landlords alike.\nRentPayment similarly reduces the hassle of paper checks and improves the rent payment and collection process by serving as a platform for renters to pay their leases directly to their property managers by credit card, debit card or e-check.\nAs lead-generation platforms begin to focus more on empowering with complex data analytics those involved in the rental process, an increasing number of startups, both small and large, are empowering renters with more flexible co-living options, capitalizing on the trends toward both optimized roommate matching and pre-furnished apartments.\nWeWork, the international co-working startup valued upwards of $16 billion as of March 2016, announced in January that it has begun to convert some of its spaces into fully furnished, flexible apartments. “WeLive replicates the security and comfort of a suburban neighborhood, but with the energy and vigor of a major city,” said the company in a statement, highlighting the company’s strategy to provide residents with private and semi-private housing accommodations alongside community events like fitness classes and potluck dinners, as well as a digital social network. Common, another co-living startup, also offers what it calls “flexible, community-driven housing,” and, in doing so, is revolutionizing the way apartment rental is traditionally done.\nAs more user-friendly startups begin to steal market share from Craigslist, the value of disruptive innovation that reduces rental-market opacity has become ever clearer, and speaks to the expectations that renters, agents and landlords now have around enabling the rental process, primarily offline in years past, with new technologies. Even more incremental changes, from video walk-throughs to new ways of slicing community rental data, have begun to play significant roles as startups cram into the real estate market, hoping for even a small slice of a huge pie.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T04:27:41Z","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/04/technology-is-finally-changing-the-apartment-rental-experience/?utm_content=buffer4751a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"}
{"text":"Aside from its thematic strengths and its delightful characters, if there’s one thing Steven Universe is known for, it’s having a killer soundtrack, jam-packed with powerful, toe-tapping songs. Last night’s episode was no exception, with a chill track that rivals some of the show’s very best musical moments.\nLast night’s “Mindful Education” was all about Steven and Connie learning how to deal with their emotions while they train together as their fusion, Stevonnie. The importance of any fusion in Steven Universe is emotional cohesion and focus—something the duo were struggling with, as Connie was distraught over a bad incident that had happened to her at school.\nThis is unrelated, I just wanted to put a gif of Stevonnie fighting in here because it’s *rad*.\nIt makes sense to draw comparisons, considering “Stronger Than You” was another Garnet song. Both songs are emotionally resonant with the character’s nature as a bonding between two individuals into a new self, but they speak to that relationship in fundamentally different ways.\n“Stronger Than You” is about a declaration of feelings: it’s a triumphant rallying cry for everything Garnet is and stands for as a character—championing her self-worth as a relationship defined by romantic love. It’s high-tempo, high-emotion, loud and bold and proud.\n“Here Comes a Thought” on the other hand, is much more about inner reflection, and has a more calming tempo. It’s still about openly accepting the emotions you feel—“the little things that matter so much”—but it’s about tempering those emotions with focus so they can be channelled healthily, a theme that sits at the core of Steven Universe. It might not be as anthemic as “Stronger Than You,” but it’s equally potent and important for the show, thematically.\nAnd like all of Steven Universe’s songs, it’s a damn good foot-tapper. When the hell is this show getting a soundtrack release?","timestamp":"2019-04-25T11:42:51Z","url":"https://io9.gizmodo.com/come-listen-to-one-of-steven-universes-best-songs-since-1785817475"}
{"text":"Update | 11:08 p.m. Read an article by Steve Lohr on keeping abreast of innovation in the Continuing Education special section.\nNoah Berger for The New York Times Tyler Kennedy, 9, searches the Web at home in California.\nThe report examined the comparative research on online versus traditional classroom teaching from 1996 to 2008. Some of it was in K-12 settings, but most of the comparative studies were done in colleges and adult continuing-education programs of various kinds, from medical training to the military.\nOver the 12-year span, the report found 99 studies in which there were quantitative comparisons of online and classroom performance for the same courses. The analysis for the Department of Education found that, on average, students doing some or all of the course online would rank in the 59th percentile in tested performance, compared with the average classroom student scoring in the 50th percentile. That is a modest but statistically meaningful difference.\n“The study’s major significance lies in demonstrating that online learning today is not just better than nothing — it actually tends to be better than conventional instruction,” said Barbara Means, the study’s lead author and an educational psychologist at SRI International.\nThis hardly means that we’ll be saying good-bye to classrooms. But the report does suggest that online education could be set to expand sharply over the next few years, as evidence mounts of its value.\nUntil fairly recently, online education amounted to little more than electronic versions of the old-line correspondence courses. That has really changed with arrival of Web-based video, instant messaging and collaboration tools.\nThe real promise of online education, experts say, is providing learning experiences that are more tailored to individual students than is possible in classrooms. That enables more “learning by doing,” which many students find more engaging and useful.\n“We are at an inflection point in online education,” said Philip R. Regier, the dean of Arizona State University’s Online and Extended Campus program.\nThe biggest near-term growth, Mr. Regier predicts, will be in continuing education programs. Today, Arizona State has 5,000 students in its continuing education programs, both through in-person classes and online. In three to five years, he estimates, that number could triple, with nearly all the growth coming online.\nBut Mr. Regier also thinks online education will continue to make further inroads in transforming college campuses as well. Universities — and many K-12 schools — now widely use online learning management systems, like Blackboard or the open-source Moodle. But that is mostly for posting assignments, reading lists, and class schedules and hosting some Web discussion boards.\nMr. Regier sees things evolving fairly rapidly, accelerated by the increasing use of social networking technology. More and more, students will help and teach each other, he said. For example, it will be assumed that college students know the basics of calculus, and the classroom time will focus on applying the math to real-world problems — perhaps in exploring the physics of climate change or modeling trends in stock prices, he said.\nFor K-12, online classes may translate to more face-to-face instruction. We pulled our son out of a useless junior high, let him play guitar and video games at home all day, and used an online charter school to teach him ourselves at night. The online curriuculum was definitely superior to what the local school offered, and the 1:1 instruction was very efficient. After one semester, he’s ahead of all his old classmates, rather than failing, and he’s enjoying life. Most people probably can’t arrange their lives to do this, but it sure can work when it works.\nIf you resonate with the studies conclusions, consider that we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. Imagine what we’ll begin to see when the generation that’s been “bathed in bits” begins building learning communities?\nImagine a mash-up of stumbleupon (randomizing), plus freerice.com (rewards/incentives), plus websites only slightly tweaked to deliver the core content required by states’ NCLB-mandated standards. The most successful (digital) charter school in history.\nGreat to see the validation from SRI.\nLearning is an independent activity Mr. Reiger to the contrary… We all decide what we want to learn — 1st decision and then for different people there are different ways to learn things… The computer which can repreat things forever — and is very patient is a good method for that reason… It can also talk to us and put up something for us to read concurrently — this is where much teaching falls down — on the visual component..A few things do need hands on practice.. say dissection but having had lots of trouble with the instruction from the human instructor on the dissection of the baby pig – I now wonder how I would have done with computer directions to guide me…. sort of like operating long distance via video hookups which are now done…..\nand thank heavesn for Wikipedia. — there are some good people out there.\nOne problem with saying that students in online classes do slightly better than students in traditional classes goes back to the old comparing apples and oranges thing. Online classes have their own assessments that may not parallel traditional assessments. The very technology tends to skew what can and cannot be assessed. Was there any standardization in the compared assessments, I wonder?\nI’m halfway through an online master’s program with SJSU’s SLIS. It’s incredibly individualist, timely, and convenient. While the difference between an instructor that can effectively utilize the technology and also bridge the gap of disconnect between students and one who cannot is literally the difference between day and night, I think that the future of education is not as “scary” as it used to be.\np.s. I assure you Hetty, that it costs much more than you think to run these types of programs well.\nI wonder to what degree the comparisons are skewed because online learners tend to have more access to technology etc in general. There could be a real effect, but dubious about the magnitude.\nIsn’t it a self-selecting group that would want to learn online? Could this be a reason why those taking online courses do better? There’s a certain drive and motivation necessary to force yourself to learn something you don’t have to.\nPerhaps by giving business, civics, math and the sciences over to online learning, truly significant time in the classroom can be given over to the arts and humanities.\nFascinating. When it came to college instruction, did the study consider whether older learners did better than traditional college students?\nIn my experience, on-line learning can work with motivated adults who already possess the BA or BS and take on-line classes to get a credential or a salary boost at work.\nTraditional-age college students need the classroom interaction. For that matter, college-level learning is NOT an individual experience. It’s totally dependent upon dialogue and discussion. Otherwise, we might as well say that all we ever need to know we can get by gazing at our navels.\nI’m very disturbed by Hetty Greene’s comment. Wikipedia may provide answers, but a college education is designed to help people ask questions and to analyze. The internet is a wonderful tool, but it does not teach analytical or critical thinking. If you don’t want those things, don’t go to college. And if you want a good lawyer, you best make sure he or she does not see the world in terms of answers and quick facts rather than in terms of questions and analysis.\nCollege students, especially those aged 18-24, need to be challenged by the professor and fellow students in person, because they are far too sheltered and naive to seek challenges to what they already think to be true. Those over the age of 24 are not much better, but if they’ve already gone to college they know to ask questions. Young people, now raised in Hetty Greene’s world in which answers and not questions are touted as the end all and be all, are especially in need of the critical thinking skills that a college education provides.\nFor that matter, most of my on-line students failed their courses and the university knew they’d fail. On-line courses are cash cows *designed* to take advantage of irresponsible, parent-shielded child-adults who, while by no means dumb, are too lazy to drop courses in which they lose interest. Students in my classroom rarely fail because they stop attending class. Students on-line, however, quickly lose interest and are so enamored of their new independence that they forget to drop the course. The F stays on their record and the university gets the cash.\nI have personally been the student in a variety of settings, including online, traditional college, foreign universities, community college, etc. What I have found is 1 year later, my retention rate of the material I learned is about the same, irrespective of the delivery method.\nThat said, I found the online learning drudgery. No live interaction with students & teachers, no debates, etc. No camaraderie, no life-long friendships formed, etc. Not good for extroverts. Living on campus with fellow students is more valuable, and leaves greater impressions, than what you learn in the classroom, particularly 30 years later. So for young people, I definitely recommend the college campus experience, living away from home starting at 18. What you learn about life & getting along with other people will never be reproduced online.\nOn the plus side, driving to class after work to listen to a bored adjunct for 90 minutes, then driving home is a waste of time. I could read that material myself in 20 minutes in the comfort of my home AND get a higher score on the test. You can move at your own speed and don’t waste time doing stuff that’s redundant. You can do assignments at 2 a.m. if you want – it’s your schedule. In these regards, online learning is superior. Much better for working stiffs trying to get ahead.\nThe subject matter is also important. Much easier to learn computer programming online than brain surgery. Anything involving people, like physical therapy, needs a large “live” component. OTH, accounting can likely be done easily online.\nBottom line is the motivated learner or student can do well in a variety of settings. As #3 pointed out, it’s cheaper to do online. Just record the professor’s lecture one time, and you’re done, even if s/he dies.\nIt’s also good for people who live in Timbuktu. You can still have access to the famous professor from home, something that was impossible before.\nFrom this overview that has been presented, it would appear that the research has discovered a correlation rather than a causation in their results.\nMore bluntly, people taking online courses are a self selected group of people who want to learn. In a regular college environment, that just isn’t there – there are plenty of deadbeats who get weeded out, or people who realize that this isn’t for them, or people who were pushed into college by mom and dad and just aren’t too terribly bright.\nComparison of test scores doesn’t validate the results that Ms. Means and her team has drawn from their research. Their results are interesting, but the essential point still stands; they’ll need more data on the students themselves to draw any form of conclusion about the real efficacy of online teaching.\nJust throwing online tools at people does not mean they will engage in meaningful learning. And many course management systems — Blackboard is the notorious biggest offender — are closed, proprietary, and their online media are decades behind the curve.\nIt’s free and open source software and all the curricular materials are free for others to use.\nYes, I strongly agree. As a teacher, I want students to have individualized learning experiences, especially students who are already 2-3 years behind.\nRight now in Florida we actually have a state law that says students who have already been retained “2 or more years” in public schools are required to be in an “alternative placement” — but no one bothered to fund any alternative placement settings for those students already left back 2 or more years who are not eligible for special ed because they do not score low enough to qualify.\nWhat these kids need is an online alternative placement classroom; one like the online classrooms now being used in NYC over the summer to teach math as recently profiled in the NY Times.\nBy offering students an online alternative, in school, the school still gets the money to educate the student, and the student has a chance for an individual online experience that may even enable the student to catch up.\nAnd, the student could still attend music, art and PE classes with their actual age peers, which is not what happens now.\nThis is not a good situation for that student, or for the other students who are actually only 10 years old.\nAnd the larger student does not like taking 4th grade art, music and PE three years in a row either.\nSo, I am looking forward to more online learning in schools, especially for situations like the above. This would really be a tremendous help to all students and teachers.\nWhile enrolled in a mixed media course, where lectures were delivered online through Blackboard with weekly discussion/quiz sessions in a classroom, we quickly found that the best way for many of us to watch the lectures was, in fact, together. This gave everyone a chance to ask questions in the middle of the lecture, and have a possible answer. However, having the ability to go straight to lectures during review helped in studying for finals, or doing homework. Nonetheless, given the complex content of the course, I feel that at least some human interaction was necessary for conceptual comprehension.\nOn the contrary, Buzz, I think most people can rearrange their lives to allow their kids the best education. There’s no law, biological or otherwise, that says kids can only learn between 9 and 3 or between September and June. Teenagers in particular are more awake in the afternoon and evening than they are at 7am. Why not allow them to adjust their educational schedule to fit their circadian rhythm by implementing more asynchronous learning?\nBeing in a doctorate program at Boston University, I can certainly attest to the rigor and depth of the educational experience. I have degrees and certification from several prominent institutions (Kenyon College, University of Colorado – Boulder, University of TN – Knoxville, University of Memphis), and would put my on-line experience at BU against any of my excellent live classroom experiences. Being able to continue to work while attending graduate school has been a major plus. I am able to remain in my house, no travel time, and can archive lectures and classes.\nOn the down side, one misses the informal exchanges of student-to-student and student to faculty personal contacts.\nI agree with the last paragraph completely. I have studied in online only, classroom only, and an online/classroom hybrid. While I learned a lot from all of them, logic in online classes and political science and all the drama that entails in classroom classes, I did like the hybrids. Sharing thoughts online and then meeting in person.\nI completed an accredited online graduate course in the Humanities at the age is 83! Independent study is the way we all learn, and through the graded discussions and a good professor, it is the only way of the future for working people who cannot travel for their studies, and saves the enormous expense of dormitory life.\nIt is truly astounding that schools do not offer more online courses..\nJS17 seems to have more varied experiences than I have; and seems to capture several facets of the argument. I think certain subjects and basic disciplines could be taught on-line; but others wouldn’t lend themselves to it. Hetty Green thinks one could become a lawyer for $100. Good luck with that. How is one going to participate in a Socratic dialogue amongst ones peers? Maybe when videoconferencing improves and becomes cheaper.\nI wonder if what could also be happening, with regards to college students participating in online courses, is that those people voluntarily taking these courses are self-selected to be students with more tenacity and self-discipline than students who would not be able to make that commitment. Just a thought. I could be way off-base here.\nMath *is* a humanity. It is not a science. It is an art in itself, not a tool, although it can be used as a tool, much as the English language can be used as a tool though it is not *merely* a tool.\nAnd the best way to learn it is through wide ranging mathematical conversation with an actual mathematician, as opposed to “problem sets”. Unfortunately there is little to no math (proofs, methods of proof etc), and next to no mathematicians, below university level in this country so most people are not exposed to this fact.. Perhaps an inherent flaw of forced “education”.\nAs to the original article, I suspect again that, because correllation is not equal to causation, there is quite a bit of self-selection in the study. Whether this be true or not, however, the lower cost of online instruction will drive increased use of online education systems in the future.\nanimation clips, virtual field trips, QTVRs, sound clips to help convey information and concepts. Much better for teachers to SHOW & TELL rather than to just TELLl information to students like our ancestors did in the Bronze Age…and assume the students know what you’re talking/telling about.\nchalkTALK to them in an attempt to convey information.\nstudents for the early 1900s?\nYouTube, Toyota etc. say we should be teaching our kids to prepare them for the workplace of 2015-2050? Or should we teach them to farm using electric tractors and combines?\nonline eSchool. And provide free “brick & mortar” preschools for all 3 and 4 year-olds who live below the poverty line.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T22:40:06Z","url":"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/study-finds-that-online-education-beats-the-classroom/"}
{"text":"The Public Service Commission on Wednesday approved a pilot program intended to create up to 350 megawatts of long-term renewable power within the next three years, a move that state officials and environmentalists say could help establish a permanent guideline that utilities would use to generate or purchase electricity from renewable sources.\nThe decision, which followed an eight-hour meeting in Covington, comes four months after the commission announced its support for the program, which is aimed at bolstering the Louisiana's fuel mix while adding resources that contribute to its reliable and economic long-term power supply.\nFor years, state officials have considered creating a renewable portfolio standard that would require regulated electricity utilities to acquire a portion of their energy from generators that use renewable sources. Some environmentalists and renewable energy advocates say the pilot program that has been approved will also encourage growth and potentially fast-track testing of smaller-scale renewable sources, which would then be sold to in-state utilities.\nDetails of the program were released for public comment in August, and based on the feedback that was received, state officials made several changes to its guidelines, including one that allows some woody biomass products to be turned into fuel.\nThe program is intended to create enough long-term renewable power supply 2 percent of the state's energy needs, by way of a request for proposals that would spur research and development of renewable energy technologies, such as biomass, geothermal, hydro, solar or wind.\nThe board met in executive session for a half-hour before returning to vote on the pilot program, with commissioners indicating that talk centered on opening the program to out-of-state resources.\nDiscussion on the pilot program, nearing the end of the day, drew a back-and-forth dialogue between Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, the lone vote against the proposal and the most vocal member of the Public Service Commission at the meeting, and several of his colleagues.\n\"In the future, who knows what will happen,\" said Skrmetta, of Metairie, who took issue with the program, set to run over several years, being considered an experimental trial. \"I don't think it's a pilot, I don't think it passes the smell test on being a pilot for me, and I think it's the wrong way to go.\"\nOther commissioners, including the board's chairman, Lambert Boissiere III of New Orleans, said the program, while not perfect, should move forward.\nAfter the meeting, Jordan Macha, a conservation organizer for the state chapter of the Sierra Club, praised the pilot program as an important step in putting Louisiana in the company of other states attempting to move away from fossil fuels in producing electricity.\n\"With anything of this magnitude, the devil's in the details,\" Macha said.\nMeanwhile, a day after New Orleans-based power provider Entergy Corp. said that the company was cooperating with a Justice Department investigation into its competitive practices, several commissioners, including Lambert and Foster Campbell, said they believed Entergy should have provided details about the inquiry in the weeks since the probe began.\n\"I'm real concerned about it,\" said Campbell, of Elm Grove, who added: \"We need to be up to date about this investigation, exactly what's involved. I hope it's nothing bad, but I'd like to know everything about it.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-19T01:11:41Z","url":"https://www.nola.com/business/2010/10/public_service_commission_appr.html"}

{"text":"What do Indy Mayor Joe Hogsett and Manual student have in common?\nJose Bravo was dressed neatly in a suit as he rode up the elevator to the 25th floor of the City-County Building. The 17-year-old was about to meet Mayor Joe Hogsett, and he wasn't sure what to expect.\nNo need to worry. The incoming senior at Manual High School and the mayor hit it off immediately. They bonded over a shared love of lifeguarding, football and Netflix.\n\"I was nervous before this, but he's like a friend,\" Bravo said. \"We're a lot alike.\"\nThe teen is the Boys & Girls Club of Indianapolis youth of the year, and Hogsett was serving as a mentor for the day. The same thing was supposed to be happening across the city for 200 other teens, but the push for volunteers for this year's Take a Boy/Girl to Work Day came up significantly short, said club director Rick Whitten.\nHogsett agreed to keep his commitment to host Bravo at his office Wednesday as a way to encourage others to step up to volunteer. A new date for the citywide initiative has not been set.\n\"If more people would take the time to mentor young people in our city, I don't think there's any question that would be transformative,\" Hogsett said. \"I think our community would be invaluably enriched. Jose is the mentor of tomorrow.\"\nAfter a tour of the city-county offices, Bravo and Hogsett sat down to a lunch of sandwiches and chips in the mayor's conference room. They talked about college, family and how the Boys & Girls Club shaped them.\nBravo has been a member of the Keenan-Stahl Boys & Girls Club, 1949 E. Troy Ave., for 10 years. He works at the club after school and is a lifeguard in the summer.\nHogsett, 60, grew up in Rushville, where he was active in the Boys Club and worked seven years as a lifeguard and manager at the city pool.\n\"He is me 43 years ago,\" the mayor said. \"I got started at the Boys Club, much like Jose has done. I worked my way up to junior leader, refereed ball games, coached sports teams.\"\nThe clubs have a \"profound\" impact on the quality of life for children in neighborhoods served by them, he said. There are 11 Boys & Girls Clubs in Indianapolis.\nBravo asked Hogsett about his efforts to get guns off the streets, just as news of another double-fatality shooting was breaking on the city's north side.\nAs U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, Hogsett said he took an aggressive approach to fighting violent crime but acknowledged the serious challenges the city faces when it comes to gun violence. \"We're doing all we can.\"\nHe then asked the teen if he watches Channel 16, the public access channel where government meetings can be viewed. Bravo politely said, \"when I can,\" while Hogsett's communications director Taylor Schaffer laughed out loud and said, \"No one watches it except you, sir; he's just being polite.\"\nHogsett admitted he is glued to Channel 16. That and Netflix, which he just discovered last fall.\nWhen Bravo asked what the mayor watches, Hogsett ticked off his favorite shows: \"House of Cards,\" \"Orange Is the New Black,\" \"GLOW,\" \"13 Reasons Why\" and \"Bloodline.\"\n\"I think if I was the mayor, I wouldn't have time to watch Netflix,\" Bravo said, more as a question than anything.\n\"I binge-watch, six or seven hours at at time\" on the weekend, Hogsett told him. \"When I watched the first season of 'House of Cards,' I thought it was over the top, unbelievable. But with what is going on in Washington today, it's like reality TV.\"\nWhen Bravo said he would probably start watching it, Hogsett laughed and said, \"You shouldn't, you're too young.\"\nBefore the two headed off to a news conference, Hogsett promised to come to one of Manual's football games in the fall, where Bravo is a linebacker. The teen hopes to attend Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to study business and communications and plans to be a mentor himself.\nLater, Whitten said the mayor served as a great example for the teen. \"We hope to encourage lots of local professionals to volunteer for a day of mentorship.\"\nTo learn more, call (317) 313-8411 or email lharris@bgcindy.org.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T08:23:03Z","url":"https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/07/13/what-do-indy-mayor-joe-hogsett-and-manual-student-have-common/471269001/"}
{"text":"Heath Herring is a colorful personality in the world of mixed martial arts, known for his Dennis Rodman-esque hairstyles, entertaining fights and a New Years Eve kiss in 2005 from an unlikely person  his opponent Yoshihiro Nakao. Though he grew up in Amarillo, Texas, Herring has traveled the world fighting in promotions such as Pride and K-1. Herring will return to his home state April 7 to fight Brad Imes in a heavyweight matchup at UFC 69 in Houston.\nI spent 20 minutes talking to Herring by phone on March 27. We discussed his UFC debut earlier this year -- a stunning loss to Jake O'Brien at UFC Fight Night 8 -- his upcoming match against Imes, and the news that the UFC owners had just purchased Pride.\nUFC Fight Night 8You lost a fairly one-sided decision to O'Brien at UFC Fight Night 8 on Jan. 25. That was your debut fight with the promotion and you were brought in with a lot of fanfare. Why do you think you lost the fight?\nI think I learned a lot at that fight. I had to realize that the UFC isn't the same organization as what I was used to fighting [for] in Japan. And the end result was that I came up short on the judges' cards. And that's what happens sometimes. You start playing a new game with little bit different rules -- sometimes those new rules will kind of catch ya.\nWhen you say new rules, what is different about the UFC compared to Pride?\nJust a lot of minor differences, I would say. Like the referee standing the fight up at different times. I think here in the states, they put a lot of credit on [what happens] once the fighters hit the ground, even if there's not a lot of action being done. I think they let the fight continue on the ground for a long time. As opposed to Japan, [where] I've been in fights where we were on the ground 10, 15 seconds [and] they'd stand us up.\nBut, I'm by no means trying to put that blame on the referee or anything else. That's absolutely my ignorance and that's why I'm taking full responsibility for that fight.\nIn hindsight, how do you feel about that performance?\nwin and like I said afterward, I like to give the fans what they want -- that's an exciting fight. I look at it as my job to be in shape and be able to go the full 15 minutes, as hard as I can. And if you get caught with a punch or get caught with a cut or something like that, that's part of it. But to lose to a guy who wasn't doing a whole lot and he was picking away the points -- yeah, that sat a little bit badly with me. But, you're going to be a little bit smarter next time and learn how things go.\nAfter your loss to O'Brien, you mentioned you had an MCL injury. First, which MCL was it?\nI think there was some stuff that did come out but I never officially came out and said either way.\nAbout the injuries, I sure hate when people make excuses about fights. And just to sum it up real quick, I went in there and I knew what the score was when I got in the fight and I still chose to get in there so I'm not going to sit back and make up an excuse for an injury. I hate when guys to do that.\nIf you read stuff -- and I'm not saying it wasn't so and it didn't happen -- but I sure hate to make that as an excuse for why I had such a poor performance.\nAre you completely healed from that injury as you prepare for UFC 69?\nYes sir. If I'm getting in the ring, [then] I'm healing up. I am feeling really, really good on it. I'm able to kick again and everything so it's [a lot] better than it was.\nI noticed that when you entered the Octagon, you puffed on an inhaler. I haven't noticed too many fighters doing this, at least not right before entering the Octagon. Is this something you do before every fight?\nYes sir. I've actually had asthma since I was a child. I think it might be a little bit more psychosomatic than anything. I can't even tell you the last time I really had to take a puff on an inhaler but I kind of just do it right before the fight more out of habit than anything. I've been fighting for 10 years and there was a time when I used to have to [use] a breathing machine before I'd fight. I'm real fortunate now that I'm able to really not have too much of a problem with my asthma. That's more of a preventative measure.\nYou also mentioned after the O'Brien fight that you wanted to give the fans excitement and you seemed to imply that wrestling doesn't deliver this excitement.\nThe point I was trying to stress was, we were in there for a fight. I don't feel I'm out of line to interpret my opponent's actions as he was taking me down, kind of just holding me down, and not doing a whole lot.\nThat was more me venting my frustration.\nEven on the ground, I think I threw more punches than he did [and] I was on my back. I was out there trying to finish the fight and I can't necessarily say the same thing about my opponent. I think he was trying to survive the fight and win on points, which is a valid strategy and obviously he won that fight. Like I said before, that was something I've had to go in and re-analyze and understand that's part of the game.\nDo you consider ground skills and takedown defense a strong part of your game?\nNormally, my ground skills are actually very, very good. And if anybody has a history of my fights, I do have very good ground skills and very good ground defense.\nUnfortunately, I was unable to show those at the athletic level I normally have this last fight.\nFor those who may not be familiar with your fights, how would you describe your fighting style?\n[Laughing] Normally? Normally, it's a very fast paced style -- I do a lot of kicking, a lot of punching. And I'm looking to end the fight on the ground [or] standing up. I've actually won probably the majority of my fights by submission, believe it or not. I'm always looking for that finish. I was a mainstay in Japan for a lot of years because I think a lot of the fans over there realized that there was always something to watch with me. I was always an exciting fighter. I wasn't known for these long, drawn out, boring fights that unfortunately sometimes seem to pepper through this sport.\nUFC 69You've traveled the world, fighting in Pride and K-1. How does it feel to now be fighting in Houston in UFC 69, near where you grew up in Amarillo, Texas?\nI'm really excited about it. I'm glad to be fighting back in my home state of Texas. It's also double-edged because it's going to be the first UFC ever in Texas and I think the fans are really, really looking forward to that. When I got the opportunity to fight on that card, I accepted right away. And I knew it was something that would be important for me to be on and be a part of.\nHouston's real far away from Amarillo but considering all the places I've been on God's green earth, it's not too far away from where I grew up. [laughing] So, I'm looking forward to it.\nYour opponent in UFC 69 -- Imes -- is a former TUF fighter who is a little taller and a little heavier than you and is also a grappler like O'Brien. What else do you know about Imes as a fighter?\nWell, to be honest with you, I don't really see him as being much of a grappler. I think he's going to come out and try to punch a lot more. But, he might surprise me. I think he's more of a stand-up kind of guy -- he likes to throw a lot of punches and do a few kicks. I know he trains with Tim Sylvia -- he's one of Sylvia's sparring partners and he comes from the Miletich fight camp.\nSo, we are looking for him to come out there and give me a good fight. And I think it'll be an exciting fight. He'll also be fighting in front of a hometown crowd as well.\nHow do you feel you will match up against him?\nI feel I match up very good against him. I'm actually really excited about this fight. I think it's a good opportunity for both of us to get out there and showcase what our skills and abilities are to the fans.\nIt's a chance for me to get a little bit of vindication after that last disappointment. [laughing] And it is for him as well. So, it's actually a good fight for both of us.\nGiven that you lost your first fight in the UFC, do you feel you are at a crossroads in your UFC career with this upcoming match?\nYou could interpret that in many ways. I've had several people ask me that question. I think if I sat down and I really let the pressure get to me, it could. But, I just have to trust in my abilities, where I've been, what I've been through. I know what I've gone through. I know all the opponents that I've faced. And I know what my abilities are. So, I'm really not too worried about it. I know I've got a place in the sport for a long time to come. Unfortunately, I feel that people weren't able to see me fight at the top of my abilities at that last fight. So, I need to come out and show everybody what I am capable of as opposed to seeing half of a performance.\nIf you do defeat Imes, who would you like to fight next?\nI've never even considered opponents to be honest with you. In Japan, that was a favorite question of all the interviewers. And I never really had a good answer for them. Whoever the organization offers up to me at the time, I'm going to take and accept. I like to stay active. I like to stay busy obviously. I just fought. I'm trying to fight again. I've had a year, year-and-a-half layoff due to some legal issues in Japan so I'm actually glad to be back in the swing of things.\nSo, as far as an opponent that I would want to face, probably the quickest fight that they'll give me after this one -- if everything goes the way I want it to -- then I'll probably say yes to [that matchup].\nYou're known for interesting haircuts and hair dye jobs. Do you have a special haircut that you have planned for this fight, your return to Texas?\nYou know what, I'm going to talk to the girl that does it. I have a girl here in Vegas -- her name's Valerie -- she's the one that does my hair. If you saw me right now, my hair's long, I've got a long beard. I just grow everything out and then I go in the week of the fight and give her free reign to do whatever she wants. I think it's a little bit like artistic freedom. I think if you're someone doing that everyday -- day in and day out -- you don't get many opportunities [where] someone just comes in and says \"Do whatever you want\"\nUsually I'm pretty open with the people who do it and they've always done a really, really good job. In Holland, I had a different guy who used to do my hair. I think they really enjoyed it. This time I might try to sway her a little bit and see if she's got something planned just for Texas. But, I think when you have an open and creative license with things, sometimes you do your best work.\nPre-UFC CareerWhy did you leave Pride at the end of 2004?\nUnfortunately I was being managed by someone who I thought was looking out for my best interest and they decided it would be better for me to move over to K-1.\nWe had a little bit of differences with K-1. Then I was forced to be in legal limbo until my contract came up as of last year.\nAs you mentioned, after you left Pride, you went to K-1. When you fought in K-1, you were part of a memorable occurrence Dec. 31, 2005. During the pre-fight staredown, your opponent, Nakao, leaned in and kissed you on the lips. You retaliated by punching him and the fight was eventually ruled a no-contest. Has Nakao ever explained why he did what he did?\nSo, neither he nor anyone else in his camp has ever apologized for the kiss?\nDo you regret reacting to that kiss with a punch -- would you have rather taken it out on him during the fight?\nNo. In hindsight, I think that's the reason that image has become so popular among people. I think people like to think that under the circumstances they would have done the same thing. And I think sometimes it's kind of hard not to be uncompromising.\nI think he learned his lesson. I don't think he's been doing that again, so I think that's a good thing.\nAs you mentioned, the video footage of that kiss has become pretty famous and UFC used footage of that kiss to promote your entry into the UFC. Were you OK with UFC doing that?\nAbsolutely, I had no problem with it. And actually, to speak kindly of K-1, they let us use that image, very kindly, without any problems.\nEverything seems to be clicking together now finally and if we start winning some fights, there won't be a problem. That's the most important thing.\nHow would you compare UFC as an organization to Pride as you knew it back then and K-1?\nWell, if you're going to do a comparison, I don't know if anybody who's ever traveled overseas or been in Japan -- you have to get used to that cultural difference. There's a significant cultural difference. [I'm] not saying if it's good or bad, it's just a difference -- you have to learn how to deal with it.\nAlso, I would say me having a little condo out here in Vegas for my training purposes, it's been really easy to be able to drive down and take care of things with the UFC people here.\nI can't say necessarily that I like one better. People in the UFC have treated me like gold and I've got nothing but a lot of good words to say about them. Same with the people in Pride. And I won't say anything bad about the people in K-1 either. There were a lot of good people in K-1. Just because we had a couple of contractual differences doesn't mean that the organization as a whole wasn't a good organization.\nAnd as someone who has fought in both Pride and UFC, what are your thoughts on the news that the owners of UFC  Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta -- are buying Pride?\nI don't know. Mixed feelings. I think the Fertittas have done a great job with UFC here in the states. They've helped the sport really grow. As somebody who competes and loves the sport -- as an athlete in it -- I'm hoping it's not going to be a bad thing. I think it's going to be a good thing. I'm just going to keep my fingers crossed.\nHow many fights do you have left on your UFC contract?\nAfter this one, I'll have three.\nSo you signed a five-fight contract with them?\nPramit Mohapatra covers mixed martial arts for baltimoresun.com.

{"text":"Talk to the average Joe on the street and he’ll tell you the world is coming undone… And he’s right.\nYet even with stocks at highs, people know there’s something terribly wrong… and they can’t seem to put their finger on why it’s happening and what it all means. The market tanked after Brexit, but it was hitting all-time highs again shortly after. What gives?\nAfter the recent terrorist attack in Nice, the odds of Frexit jumped higher in Las Vegas. France is being torn apart by the EU’s open borders immigration policy. And France is on the verge of a civil war over it. The EU might survive Brexit. But it won’t survive Frexit. And neither will the global financial system.\nThe problem’s epicenter is Italian banks. Italy’s banks are broke. Many are insolvent. They’re sitting on $400 billion in bad loans. That makes up more than 18% of the country’s loans. In comparison, Britain’s bad loans only make up 1.5% of total loans. And there’s no easy way out. The crisis is spreading to the wider Italian economy. And Italy’s the third-largest economy in the eurozone.\nItalian politicians are being pressured to take action. The problem is their desired solutions most likely mean the end of the EU’s banking union… and the entire European project. A taxpayer bailout would put Italy on a collision course with Eurocrats in Brussels and would threaten the EU’s very existence. EU rules state that bank investors must pay up before the banks can be bailed out.\nThis drama pits taxpayers versus banksters versus hapless bureaucrats. And the big European banks with exposure want Italian taxpayers to make them whole.\nWho will win this showdown? And then what? What are the next dominos to fall?\nI traveled to Singapore recently for an important conversation with one of the most legendary investors in the world, Jim Rogers. Rogers has seen it all and done it all. His perspective on history and global finance is unmatched. That’s why I ventured to see him for his take on the great global unraveling taking place right before our eyes.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T09:19:25Z","url":"https://dailyreckoning.com/think-brexits-not/"}

{"text":"Jews and Arabs clashed repeatedly in the mixed Mediterranean coastal city of Akko (Acre) during the Yom Kippur holiday. Police are on high alert.\nAn Arab driver nearly ran down a group of Jews in the street, the latter - fearing a terror attack - stoned him, and Arabs rioted and vandalized Jewish property in the mixed northern coastal city of Akko (Acre) during the Yom Kippur holiday and fast. Clashes began Wednesday evening and lasted through Thursday night. Police are on alert to prevent further provocations or acts of vengeance.\nThe day of violence began Wednesday evening, just after the start of the Yom Kippur fast, when an Arab driver from Akko's Old City entered a majority-Jewish neighborhood at high-speed. The vehicle raised suspicions, as in Israel it is considered unacceptable for anyone other than emergency vehicles to drive on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, although it is not forbidden by law. The driver had to bypass a barrier set up to block traffic at the entrance to the neighborhood.\nA resident of the city told Israel National News that the motorist was spotted driving at a high speed towards a park where a group of Jewish youth had gathered. Fearing they were the target of a vehicular terrorist attack - of the type that has been perpetrated several times in recent months - the youths pelted the car with rocks and called for help. Jews from the neighborhood gathered and the driver took refuge with his relatives, a local Arab family.\nAt that point, Akko Arabs were called to come to the aid of the driver and his family, with the help of a rumor that Jews had killed an Arab resident of the Old City. Arabs began smashing cars and \"everything in their way,\" one eyewitness said. A police officer, the Arab driver and another person were lightly injured as hundreds of people, Jews and Arabs, clashed.\nPolice, representatives of Akko City Hall and local Arab leaders managed to end the clashes, but the violence continued as Arabs heading back to their neighborhoods ran riot through Jewish areas of the city. Calling \"Death to the Jews\" and Allah hu akbar (\"Allah is great\"), the rioters vandalized hundreds of Jewish-owned shops and vehicles, and threw rocks at people on their way to or from Yom Kippur prayers.\nAccording to an eyewitness, \"The Arabs threatened Jews that if they left their home they'd be attacked. The Arabs began vandalizing Jewish-owned cars in the street and smashing windows. Afterwards, we saw them coming with axes and slashing tires. It was awful. Residents were afraid to leave for the synagogue.\"\nSources in the Akko municipality claimed that among those inciting the Arab mobs were known Islamist activists. Police arrested eight people on suspicion of involvement in the violence. Four people were arraigned Thursday, the others will see a judge on Friday.\nClashes resumed Thursday night after the fast ended, with demonstrations by hundreds of Jews and Arabs near the train station in the eastern section of the city and near the housing projects in the northern neighborhoods. Jewish youths set fire to an empty lot and attempted to make their way to other parts of the city.\nPolice blocked the eastern entrance to Akko and have been pushing Jewish protesters back towards a local first aid station. To disperse the crowds, police used stun and gas grenades, as well as water hoses, but had difficulty controlling the demonstrators. Clashes with the police continued sporadically into the night, as the Northern District Police Chief, Shimon Koren, is personally overseeing the crowd control operations.\nPolice are deploying hundreds of officers, patrol cars and special forces in the city's hot spots. \"We know that Jews intend to carry out acts of revenge, but we are not talking about an organized initiative,\" a police spokesman said. \"The force will prevent any such interaction.\"\nPublic Security Minister Avi Dichter is monitoring the situation closely; he arrived in the city for a visit on Friday morning.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T04:40:37Z","url":"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/127921"}
{"text":"BAGNERES-DE-LUCHON, France (Reuters) - The Tour de France is set for its moment of truth on Wednesday as the peloton prepares for a brutal 17th stage that could decide whether leader Geraint Thomas or defending champion Chris Froome will wear the yellow jersey in Paris.\nIt could, however, also open the door for a challenger to emerge and Dutchman Tom Dumoulin is one of those lying in wait for the top two to slip up.\nShould he gain time on Thomas, the world time trial champion could still pip the Team Sky duo in Saturday’s solo effort against the clock. Thomas leads fellow Briton Froome by 1:39, with Dumoulin 11 seconds further back before Wednesday’s savage 65-km trek that ends with the much-feared climb up the Col du Portet, a lung-busting 16-km ascent at an average gradient of 8.7 percent. “This stage is going to be massively decisive, there are going to be big gaps,” said Thomas. “You can’t get carried away at the start because the last climb is one of the hardest of the Tour.” Riders with an outside chance of winning, or making it to the podium on the Champs Elysees, will, however, be tempted to blow up the race from the start, with Frenchman Romain Bardet, fifth overall and an excellent descender, the main suspect.\n“It will be important to be steady on the descents, you can easily make a mistake,” warned Thomas. “Everyone is a bit apprehensive about this stage.” Team Sky have said that Thomas and Froome will not race against each other, but the four-times champion is a far better descender than the yellow jersey holder, and knows he must take time off of his team mate to stand a chance of winning the race for a record-equalling fifth time. “In that final climb anything can happen,” said Thomas. “We may find ourselves having to chase someone or together in front. There could be big gap, and different scenarios, as long as we don’t race against each other.” To spice things up, as the stage begins with a climb, organisers have decided that the riders will line up at the start in a grid formation based on the overall standings.\nThe idea, however, has been dubbed as purely cosmetic by riders and team staff.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T06:19:09Z","url":"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cycling-france-thomas/moment-of-truth-for-thomas-as-brutal-stage-awaits-idUKKBN1KE2J9"}

{"text":"Earth requires fuel to drive plate tectonics, volcanoes and its magnetic field. Like a hybrid car, Earth taps two sources of energy to run its engine: primordial energy from assembling the planet and nuclear energy from the heat produced during natural radioactive decay. Scientists have developed numerous models to predict how much fuel remains inside Earth to drive its engines -- and estimates vary widely -- but the true amount remains unknown. In a new paper, a team of geologists and neutrino physicists boldly claims it will be able to determine by 2025 how much nuclear fuel and radioactive power remain in the Earth's tank. The study, authored by scientists from the University of Maryland, Charles University in Prague and the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, was published on September 9, 2016, in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.\n\"I am one of those scientists who has created a compositional model of the Earth and predicted the amount of fuel inside Earth today,\" said one of the study's authors William McDonough, a professor of geology at the University of Maryland. \"We're in a field of guesses. At this point in my career, I don't care if I'm right or wrong, I just want to know the answer.\"\nDetecting antineutrinos requires a huge detector the size of a small office building, housed about a mile underground to shield it from cosmic rays that could yield false positive results. Inside the detector, scientists detect antineutrinos when they crash into a hydrogen atom. The collision produces two characteristic light flashes that unequivocally announce the event. The number of events scientists detect relates directly to the number of atoms of uranium and thorium inside the Earth. And the decay of these elements, along with potassium, fuels the vast majority of the heat in the Earth's interior.\nTo date, detecting antineutrinos has been painfully slow, with scientists recording only about 16 events per year from the underground detectors KamLAND in Japan and Borexino in Italy. However, researchers predict that three new detectors expected to come online by 2022--the SNO+ detector in Canada and the Jinping and JUNO detectors in China--will add 520 more events per year to the data stream.\n\"Once we collect three years of antineutrino data from all five detectors, we are confident that we will have developed an accurate fuel gauge for the Earth and be able to calculate the amount of remaining fuel inside Earth,\" said McDonough.\n\"Knowing exactly how much radioactive power there is in the Earth will tell us about Earth's consumption rate in the past and its future fuel budget,\" said McDonough. \"By showing how fast the planet has cooled down since its birth, we can estimate how long this fuel will last.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-23T00:53:50Z","url":"http://esciencenews.com/articles/2016/09/11/scientists.expect.calculate.amount.fuel.inside.earth.2025"}

The cancer mortality rate for elephants is less than 5% compared with 25% in people, the study said.\nA team of scientists from the University of Utah and Arizona State University said they can explain the lower numbers.\nIn their search for answers, they combed through elephant DNA and found a few deviations.\nElephants have extra genes that stop tumors long before they form.\nThey have “at least 40 copies of genes that code for p53, a protein well known for its cancer-inhibiting properties,” scientists said. In comparison, humans have only two copies of such genes.\nThe massive animals also detect damaged cells preemptively, which they then repair or kill.\n“Elephants may have a more robust mechanism for killing damaged cells that are at risk for becoming cancerous,” the study said.\nDuring the study, scientists extracted white blood cells from elephants and damaged the cells’ DNA.\n“It’s as if the elephants said, ‘It’s so important that we don’t get cancer, we’re going to kill this cell and start over fresh,'” said Joshua Schiffman, one of the study’s author and a pediatric oncologist at the University of Utah School of Medicine.\nThe study involved work by researchers from the two universities, and the Ringling Bros. Center for Elephant Conservation. The results were published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nWithout the genetic cancer-fighting ability, elephants would be long gone.\nWhile there are other contributing factors that make humans more at risk of getting cancer, experts said, the study provides insight on treatment.\n“Nature has already figured out how to prevent cancer,” Schiffman said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T20:37:46Z","url":"https://fox4kc.com/2015/10/10/elephant-genes-hold-clues-for-fight-against-cancer-scientists-say/"}

{"text":"BOSTON – A disgraced former state chemist may have tainted more prosecutions than officials had first estimated, an independent reviewer of narcotics cases said Tuesday.\nMore than 40,000 defendants may have been affected by the chemist&apos;s mishandling of samples, said David Meier, an attorney appointed by the Massachusetts governor to review prosecutions connected to the state lab scandal.\nMeier, who led a file-by-file review of narcotics cases in which Annie Dookhan tested samples, said he&apos;ll meet with prosecutors, defense lawyers and judges to discuss how to best use the findings.\nAuthorities had previously estimated publicly that Dookhan had tested samples involving about 34,000 defendants.\nThey have alleged that Dookhan tampered with evidence and faked results during her nine years at the now-closed Boston lab. The 35-year-old Franklin resident has pleaded not guilty to a 27-count indictment related to her alleged wrongdoing in cases stemming from six counties.\nGov. Deval Patrick thanked Meier for his work to try to help resolve the legal morass.\n\"Now, with this detailed information, the many participants in the criminal justice system can do the work of getting each individual case right,\" Patrick said in a statement Tuesday.\nOfficials also said Tuesday that the state had spent $7.6 million to date in dealing with the crisis. The Legislature has authorized up to $30 million to cover costs incurred by the court system, prosecutors, public defenders and other state agencies.\nA year ago, Patrick ordered the lab closed after state police took over the facility through a budget directive and uncovered what they called Dookhan&apos;s failure to follow testing protocols and her deliberate mishandling of evidence.\nThe scandal sent a ripple through the state&apos;s criminal justice system, exposing thousands of convictions to legal challenges.\nMeier, who previously served as a prosecutor in Middlesex and Suffolk counties and is a partner at Boston law firm Todd & Weld, started his review by generating a list of 690 people in state prisons and 450 in county jails who were serving sentences based at least partly on Dookhan-related drug tests.\nBut the list didn&apos;t include thousands of people who were awaiting trial, were on probation or were serving federal sentences in cases that Dookhan tested samples.\nPolice arrested Dookhan last September, and a grand jury issued an indictment in December that charged her with crimes including obstruction of justice and perjury.\nHer attorney filed a motion last week seeking to have statements she allegedly made to state police thrown out.\nDookhan said police didn&apos;t give her a Miranda warning while doing an interview at her home in which authorities have alleged that she admitted to wrongdoing that included making negative drug samples into positive ones and \"dry labbing,\" or testing only some drug samples and assuming the rest were positive.\nA state spokesman said last week that least 337 state prison inmates have been let out of custody as a result of the lab scandal, and the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association said at least 1,115 cases were dismissed or not prosecuted because of Dookhan&apos;s involvement or due to problems with producing documents because of the lab closure.\nCourt officials also set up drug lab court sessions that special magistrates have been presiding over to handle motions brought by defendants claiming to be wrongly incarcerated due to Dookhan&apos;s alleged misconduct.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T22:57:29Z","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-cases-linked-to-massachusetts-lab-scandal-review-says"}

{"text":"New analysis shows 22 of Australia’s largest companies are actively working to undermine the Paris agreement targets, betting shareholders’ money on strategies that assume global climate change action fails.\nInvestor action group Market Forces says those companies – worth a combined $121bn and representing 7% of the ASX300 – are “out of line and out of time” and has called on shareholders to divest their holdings.\nThe group’s legal analyst, Will van de Pol, said it was the first time Market Forces had “named names” and called out companies whose business strategies relied on the world failing to meet the Paris targets to restrict the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n“A handful of Australian companies are undermining efforts to limit global warming by pursuing new fossil fuel projects, or basing their business plans on energy projection scenarios that would doom the Paris agreement to failure,” the report says.\nThe list of “uninvestables” includes mainly resource and energy companies, but also diversified investment vehicles including WH Soul Pattinson and Seven Group Holdings.\nThe Market Forces study found that 199 ASX300 companies, representing 64% of total market capitalisation, faced heightened transitional climate risk but had not yet demonstrated business strategies consistent with the Paris agreement.\nThere were 143 companies with policies “not overtly inconsistent with Paris”, and just eight had aligned their strategy with the agreement.\nThree companies – AGL, Origin and BHP – earned a reprieve from the list of the worst offenders, despite acting in a similar manner, because Market Forces said they had shown some progress towards aligning their goals with Paris.\nIn recent years, the boardroom has become an increasingly important front for climate activism.\nThis month, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, announced it would divest from firms that explored for oil and gas. Last month, Glencore said it would no longer back new coalmines in response to investor calls for the company to act on climate change.\nPressure is also increasing on Australian companies, though many still refuse to even consider the financial risk posed to their businesses by climate change.\nIn September, a report from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said “the law requires” relevant companies to “include a discussion of climate risk” in their annual report.\nIn February, the Asic corporate governance council released new recommendations that directors and companies should make climate risk disclosures.\nThe Market Forces report singled out “coal cowboys” Whitehaven and New Hope, which it said had plans to establish new coalmines, or expand existing ones, based on forecasts that assume the failure of Paris.\nOil and gas companies Woodside, Santos and Oil Search had each “faced increased investor engagement over climate change in recent years, but this has done nothing to dissuade their plans to increase fossil fuel production”, the report said.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T22:53:07Z","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/25/out-of-line-top-australian-companies-accused-of-undermining-paris-deal"}

{"text":"Composting is the ultimate win-win-win for gardeners.\nIt is recycling at its most basic, turning yard and kitchen waste into rich, organic planting material. It saves money on fertilizer and pesticides. It keeps earthworms working and off the street.\nThere are several types of composting that involve varying degrees of commitment. Aerobic, which uses air to compost, is quick, but high maintenance because your heap needs frequent turning; anaerobic, both low-maintenance and very slow, is done without air and involves letting waste sit undisturbed for years; vermicomposting employs red worms, bacteria and insects to break down matter (medium maintenance and speed).\nBut, as Brett L. Markham points out in his excellent \"The Mini Farming Guide to Composting\" (Skyhorse Publishing), nature is on your side: No matter which method you choose, it's nearly impossible to screw this up. \"Nature loves compost,\" he writes, \"and will turn anything that was once alive (or produced by something living) into compost all by itself.\"\nSo let's set up an aerobic composting bin.\nWhat you need: Markham recommends chicken-wire bins: four posts (six is better, so you can have two side-by-side bins) and 48-inch-high chicken wire. Why two bins? One for new material, and the other for compost that's farther along in the decomposition process.\nFind a location: Practically speaking, try to set up near the garden where you'll be spreading your compost. Moving vast amounts across your property will wear you out. In their book \"The Complete Compost Gardening Guide\" (Storey), Barbara Pleasant and Deborah L. Martin note that you may have to strike a balance: Compost heaps do better in shade, but gardens are in the sun.\nWhat's in? What's out? For a basic aerobic compost heap, grass clippings, leaves (run them through a leaf grinder, if you can, to reduce their size and speed up the process), twigs and other plant materials are all welcome. Indoor fodder can include coffee grounds, tea bags, fruit and vegetable scraps, even freezer-burned vegetables. No meats, no fats. Bones, though, if thoroughly cooked, are fine (they provide calcium and phosphorous). But bury them at least 3 inches down.\nCritters: Worms and insects help break down the compost material. Other garden-helpful insects, such as crickets, take refuge in the compost heap. If you add bones and they get exposed, you may have to fend off raccoons (or, more likely, the neighbor's poodle). The chicken wire should be a sufficient deterrent.\nMaintenance: When starting fresh, you may want to buy a bag of commercial compost — its bacteria and other microorganisms are already cranked up — and toss it in to get your bin percolating. Once you're up and running, add some of your own mature compost to your second bin. Turn your material every couple of days. To get air into the mix — this is aerobic composting, remember — drive a short length of rebar into the pile and wiggle it around to make a hole and promote air penetration. Do this at several points. Monitor the temperature. As the decomposition process accelerates, the temperature will rise. (Specially made thermometers are sold at garden centers.) If the temp gets above 150 degrees, the process can slow down or stop. Frequent mixing will prevent that from happening.\nMoisture is a must for successful compost. For aerobic, the material should feel damp and clump together, but not be so wet that water can be squeezed out. If your aerobic pile is too dry, turn it and add water.\nWhen is it ready? Markham says that immature compost produces chemicals that prevent germination. When you see earthworms thriving in your pile and weeds are starting to sprout, your compost is ready.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T01:38:34Z","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/living/ct-xpm-2013-04-17-sc-fam-0416-lifeskill-compost-20130416-story.html"}
{"text":"WASHINGTON, Jun 4 2013 (IPS) - President Barack Obama tried Monday to jumpstart a new national discussion on mental health, sponsoring a conference with Vice-President Joe Biden aimed at reducing social stigma around the issue.\nThe event took place five months after two-dozen schoolchildren were killed in a shooting spree in the state of Connecticut by a killer who allegedly suffered from psychological problems. Since then bipartisan supporters have urged greater government focus on overhauling the country’s creaky mental health infrastructure.\nFitzpatrick called the United States’ current system of care for young adults dealing with mental health issues “abysmal”.\nAccording to President Obama, speaking Monday at the opening of the conference, one in five adults in the United States experiences some form of mental illness. In addition, some 22 veterans of war commit suicide each day.\nPresident Obama announced the launch of the new website, mentalhealth.gov, a clearinghouse of information for those seeking mental health services. The site will also host stories of those who have overcome mental health-related problems.\nAlongside the website, U.S. media outlets across the country are set to start a coordinated national campaign aimed at destigmatising mental health. According to organisers, the campaign will start by focusing simply on getting those suffering from mental health problems to feel comfortable talking about their experiences.\n“If someone had cancer in your family or diabetes, you wouldn’t be afraid to seek help or talk about it,” Dennis Wharton, a communications executive for the National Association of Broadcasters, told IPS.\nWharton says the new ads will not star celebrities, but instead feature a cross-section of U.S. society. “Because mental health knows no gender or race boundaries – this affects all walks of life,” he says.\nSignificant resources will be aimed at people who have served in the U.S. military.\nFor instance, Blue Star Families, an advocacy group for military families, will be producing a series of ads featuring country music stars urging veterans with mental health problems to seek help.\nAccording to Barbara Van Dahlen, president of Give an Hour, a mental health advocacy group for veterans, says it’s unsurprising that many veterans suffer from mental illness, given their wartime experiences.\nVan Dahlen stresses the need for trauma and substance abuse to be included in the category of mental illnesses. Advocates emphasise that substance abuse is an indicator of deeper problems, often mental health issues – and that dealing with those problems often helps with the substance abuse, as well.\nPresident Obama announced that in coming months more than 150 “summits”, similar to Monday’s conference, would take place across the country. Hosted by the Department of Veteran Affairs, these will be held between July and September.\n“What we ultimately want to do is take the conversations we are having today in the White House, and take them to school auditoriums, community centres, houses of worship, living rooms and kitchen tables across this country,” Health Secretary Sebelius said.\nNonetheless, she also warned of the presence of significant barriers to the new initiative, particularly given years of cost-cutting and the current environment of financial austerity.\nThe president’s 2014 budget, for instance, has a request for the training of 5,000 new mental health providers, particularly those who can work with people to transition into university.\nAccording to the National Alliance on Mental Health’s Fitzpatrick, the United States currently requires a massive effort to train practitioners and other medical professionals to be able to offer some form mental health care. Currently, he says, many who are actively seeking help simply cannot find it.\nFirst, however, the new Obama administration push on this issue is focusing on trying to make people comfortable enough to discuss their experiences in the first place. In closing comments Monday, Vice-President Biden drew on personal experiences to urge others seek out mental health-related help if they need it.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T10:52:54Z","url":"http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/06/obama-pledges-to-bring-mental-health-out-of-shadows/"}
{"text":"Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani exits following a news conference on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters in New York, US, September 26, 2018. Photo: REUTERS/Brendan Mcdermid/File Photo.\nJNS.org – Recent reports that the Iranians have removed their personnel from southern Syria and transferred their main activity hub from Damascus International Airport to the T-4 airbase in the heart of the Syrian desert indicate that the first round of the Iranian-Israeli conflict in Syria has ended in resounding defeat for Tehran.\nSome in Israel voiced concern and criticized the government’s decision, which the defense establishment had encouraged, to wage a campaign against Iranian entrenchment in Syria. It is a fact, however, that the determination displayed by Israel bore fruit and its objectives were met without sparking a war on the northern border and while avoiding a diplomatic crisis with Russia.\nThe important takeaway from the first round is that those who dare, win. Iran blinked first and chose to duck a fight with Israel. It’s also possible it didn’t want to push its luck in terms of its relations with Bashar Assad and Vladimir Putin, the patron of the Damascus regime.\nThis further evidences the limitations of Iran’s power and certainly that of its Quds Force, the foreign arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Syria. The Quds Force couldn’t establish a solid foothold in Syria once Israel began pummeling it and therefore its ability to retaliate, threaten, and mainly deter Israel is still limited.\nIt’s not for nothing that Quds Force chief Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani wants the current government in Israel to fall. He even believes, according to media leaks, that a strong Iranian response to Israeli attacks in Syria could influence the outcome of the upcoming election in Israel. Iran is possibly behind Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s recent attempts in Gaza to spark another clash with Israel on the southern front. The Iranians want to influence the election results in Israel and at the very least deter Israel’s leadership from continuing the campaign against them in Syria. In the meantime, this hasn’t been working.\nAs stated, however, this is only the first round. The Iranians won’t throw in the towel so easily. Their presence in Syria, alongside their entrenchment in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, is a strategic goal for which they have spilled blood and spent billions of dollars. We can assume Iran will persist with efforts to establish a presence in Syria, even if in the country’s north, in the hope that the Russians will curb Israel’s attempts to uproot them from there as well. After all, in contrast to Israel, Russia doesn’t view Tehran’s presence in Syria as a threat and believes that it can curtail the Iranians.\nMeanwhile, Iran last week celebrated the 40-year anniversary of its Islamic Revolution. On Feb. 1, 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned to Iran riding the wave of protests against the Shah’s regime and wrested control of the country for him and his cohort of clerics. These have been 40 years of uncompromising fanaticism, increasing international isolation, unrelenting subversion in the region and beyond, and burning hatred for the United States and Israel. But more importantly for the citizens of Iran, it has been 40 years of corrupt and violent dictatorial rule that has led the country to the brink of social and economic ruin.\nIran’s only dubious achievements over this time, not coincidentally, pertain mostly to its ballistic missiles, which it touts day and night. The latest — a cruise missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers (around 800 miles) — was unveiled last week to mark the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.\nIt isn’t clear, by the way, if the reports from Tehran are accurate. To be sure, the Iranians tend to distort and exaggerate such accomplishments even when their missiles are far from being operational. What is pertinent, however, is Iran’s trend and ongoing intention of manufacturing missiles capable of reaching not just Israel but Europe and in the future the United States as well.\nThe price for these missiles, as we all know, is being paid by the people of Iran; mainly the country’s youth who have essentially been sentenced to a life of economic hardship, poverty, and ignorance and mostly a lack of hope for a better future. The gap between the Iranian people and their leaders has never been larger and another revolution to topple the regime is undoubtedly only a matter of time. This is still quite a few years away, however, because the ayatollahs, similar to their ally Assad, are willing to kill millions before bidding adieu to the global stage.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T00:04:07Z","url":"https://www.algemeiner.com/2019/02/10/tehran-eyes-upcoming-israeli-elections/"}
{"text":"Home Procurement News Why is lean accounting necessary in the supply chain?\nWhy is lean accounting necessary in the supply chain?\nKnowing how to manage your finances is important for any business. If you aren't sure how much money you have in your accounts, you won't be able to pay your bills. Overseeing cash flow is crucial for keeping your finances in order. However, the processes in the supply chain are changing, and you'll need an accounting method that will accommodate those switches.\nWhat accounting methods are currently used?\nTraditionally, there are two main techniques for overseeing the money coming in and going out of a company: accrual and cash. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. However, one may benefit the business more than the other depending on the size and income of the company.\nWith cash accounting, you don't count any transactions until you receive payments or the bills are taken out of your account, explained NOLO, an online legal resource for consumers and businesses. This method is used primarily by smaller businesses and may offer a more accurate account of your finances. Because you don't record any payments coming in or going out of the company until they're actually received, you'll always know how much money you have in the bank. However, this may provide an inaccurate statement of your successes and struggles because sales cannot be recorded until payments are received.\nAccrual accounting is the opposite. Revenue and expenses are included in your budget when the services are completed or the products are delivered, according to NOLO. This allows you to keep a more accurate record of your cash flow, as you'll see your sales as they happen. However, this may give the appearance that you have more or less money than is actually in your accounts.\nHow does the supply chain affect accounting?\nIn today's society, more emphasis has been placed on conserving resources and protecting the environment. However, with traditional manufacturing methods, that cannot always happen. Both materials and money can go to waste, as companies are thinking in terms of mass production, explained BMA Inc., a lean manufacturing consulting company. This can lead to excess inventory for businesses and higher costs for consumers.\nA new workflow has made its way to the market to reduce these results. Lean manufacturing works to reduce waste, meet demand, lower prices and create a more efficient supply chain, the Journal of Accountancy claimed. Processes in production are moved near each other so that the products can switch stations with ease. This cuts lead-time and lowers prices because companies are able to create products when their customers want them. However, this manufacturing process requires a special type of accounting to take these changes into consideration.\nLean accounting allows people to make real-time decisions based on weekly reports and production expenses, Luis Socconini, the founder and director of the Lean Six Sigma Institute, explained to IndustryWeek contributor Michele Nash-Hoff. The method can improve accounts payable and receivable, payroll, inventory and budgets. Lean accounting may even be able to help determine prices and see which products are successful.\nShortened delivery times from three weeks to four days.\nReduction in inventory storage from six months to less than two months.\nIncreased employee productivity to $2,750 from $1,560.\nDespite the benefits, not many businesses have made the switch to the new method. However, Socconini believed lean accounting will be popular in the next five to 10 years.\nBy switching to lean accounting, you are able to accommodate the changes in the supply chain. The efficiency and speed of the new manufacturing process will need to be accounted for in the financial records, as traditional cash and accrual accounting may not be as accurate throughout all parts of the workflow.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T10:04:04Z","url":"https://www.strategicsourceror.com/2015/09/why-is-lean-accounting-necessary-in.html"}

{"text":"Whenever “nation building” gets trotted out you can be pretty sure the advocates of the subject proposal have little confidence in the logic of their argument. The big question to my mind is why anyone who knows anything about transport and cities still takes this idea seriously.\nWhy is this even a thing? Why are we still talking about east coast HSR in 2019 as if it’s a pressing national priority?\nIt’s not because there’s an obvious problem to be addressed. There’s already a regular public transport service operating on this route. It’s got adequate capacity and scope to scale up in line with demand. Importantly, it’s a competitive market with four major operators i.e. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin.\nThis isn’t like a new outer suburban growth area where there’s no rail access at all. East coast HSR is about replacing one form of public transport with another. That’d be fine except for the fact it hinges on provision of a mammoth subsidy.\nIt’s not because it only requires a modest outlay of a few billion dollars or so. Any discussion of east coast HSR must be in the context of the truly monumental level of public subsidy required to build it. The 2013 study undertaken by Labor and the Greens put the capital cost at $114 – $127 billion (that’s a ‘b’) and made it clear virtually all of that would have to come from the public purse.\nBut we know it’s near-certain the cost would be much higher, probably in the range $150 – $200 billion, because early scoping studies like this invariably grossly under-estimate the cost, largely due to optimism bias (see Why do the worst infrastructure projects get built? and Are cost estimates for transport projects reliable?). The cost of building California HSR was initially estimated at $33 billion in 2008; by 2018 it had escalated to $63.2 – $98.1 billion.\nIs it instead of a second Sydney Airport?\nIt’s not because Sydney’s second airport isn’t going ahead. One of the key arguments for east coast HSR was that it might obviate or delay the need to build a costly second airport in Sydney. That’s no longer relevant. Construction of Nancy-Bird Walton Airport at Badgerys Creek started on September 2018, with completion scheduled for December 2026.\nIn fact, the new airport weakens the case for east coast HSR. According to the Labor/Greens HSR feasibility study, that’s because it would reduce a key driver of demand for HSR – delays and unpredictability of flight times at Kingsford Smith airport arising from air traffic congestion. The study found the new airport would lower the demand for HSR into and out of Sydney and therefore decrease the economic benefits.\nIs it to tackle emissions?\nIt’s not because it’s an efficient way of reducing emissions. After allowing for additional emissions from construction, operation and induced demand, east coast HSR would yield net savings of 55 Mt CO2-e over 50 years. That sounds good, but given the estimated cost of construction it would be an extraordinarily expensive way of addressing climate change i.e. circa $2,000 per tonne of CO2-e avoided. At a more likely $150 billion for construction, the cost rises to $2,700 per tonne (see So high speed rail would increase carbon emissions?).\nThat scale of subsidy would have a much larger impact on emissions if it were instead used to fund renewable power generation. The Bloomberg New Energy Finance energy outlook estimates the cost of making 92% of generation in Australia from renewable sources by 2050 is $186 billion.\nIs it to improve equity?\nIt’s not because it would be more equitable. The great bulk of benefits from east coast HSR would come from faster trips between Sydney and Melbourne for business travellers. This group currently pays the full capital and operating cost of air travel; there’s no reason why it should now be gifted such a titanic subsidy.\nIs it much, much faster?\nIt’s not because east coast HSR would be significantly faster than flying. CBD business people are the key beneficiaries; they’d save 15 minutes door-to-door travelling from Melbourne CBD to Sydney CBD, compared to what’s currently a three-hour journey by air (although HSR would be slower from Sydney to Brisbane than air). Nice, but hardly worth a couple of generations worth of infrastructure subsidy.\nIs it to decentralise big cities?\nIt’s not because it would encourage decentralisation and “grow the regions”. The Labor/Greens feasibility study couldn’t find any net benefits from regional development. Heavily subsidised HSR fares from somewhere like Shepparton to Melbourne (notwithstanding that air fares aren’t subsidised!) wouldn’t shift high-paying jobs from the capital cities to the regions. Rather, they’d just promote regional sprawl by creating remote dormitory suburbs for city centre workers.\nIs it to reduce housing costs?\nIt’s not because it would reduce housing costs appreciably compared to the capital cities. They’ll be much the same in Goulburn as they are in the outer suburbs of Sydney. It’s hard to see why sprawl in Goulburn or Yass would somehow be better than sprawl in Liverpool (see Will business really pay for High Speed Rail? and Is value capture the silver bullet for funding infrastructure?).\nIt’s not because it would be “transformative” or “nation building” as claimed by Ms Rice and Mr Albanese. How can that be the case when it will mostly do pretty much what planes already do i.e. move travellers between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne?\nThe fact that it’s a bit faster than flying for some potential users doesn’t make it “transformative” or “nation building”. This is nothing like the huge increase in speed that trains in the 19th century, and subsequently planes in the post-war era, brought to east coast inter-capital travel. The only way it might be transformative is if it were to destroy the competitive airline services between Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne, leading to higher fares and/or fewer services, and perhaps ultimately an HSR monopoly.\nFaster trains might well have a role in the future in connecting far-flung suburbs and major regional centres like Canberra and Newcastle to Sydney, but something like the 160 km/h Type D Trainset currently being tested for the New Airport Line in Beijing is likely to be a much better fit than the 350 km/h HSR service touted by Mr Albanese and Ms Rice.\nPublic funding on the scale required to build east coast HSR could be more usefully deployed in many other ways. For example, it could be used to improve over-loaded public transport systems in capital cities (e.g. see What would happen if public transport use grew faster?).\nIt says something truly awful about our political culture and the standard of public discourse, especially around cities and transport, that this foolishness still has legs. I don’t expect gunzels are going to lose their enthusiasm for east coast HSR, but it’s way past time politicians, academics and the commentariat got over this folly. And it’s time to be a great deal more circumspect with terms like “nation building”.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T16:00:14Z","url":"https://blogs.crikey.com.au/theurbanist/2019/03/16/why-is-east-coast-high-speed-rail-still-being-taken-seriously/"}

{"text":"It takes a lot to make me feel ashamed of London, my beloved home city. But yesterday’s tower-block inferno did it. The raging fire at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, the disturbing speed with which this home to hundreds was reduced to a smouldering shell of a building, heaps shame on this city. It is positively Dickensian, a hellish scene out of place in 2017, like a violent echo from an older era when safety, especially the safety of the poor, was of little moment. London needs to look in the mirror. This cannot just be chalked up to ‘tragedy’.\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it was the low social status of the inhabitants of the tower that left them vulnerable to this horror. That’s a serious charge, I know, but how else do we explain that residents who complained about fire hazards were ignored? The Grenfell Action Group residents’ association complained to the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) — which manages Grenfell — about ‘terrifying power surges’ caused by ‘faulty wiring’. It predicted that only a ‘serious fire in a tower block’ would lead to KCTMO being ‘brought to justice’. It remains to be seen how neglectful KCTMO was, if it was at all, but it is profoundly concerning that residents say their complaints were ignored. Their worries ‘fell on deaf ears’, they say. It’s hard to imagine the residents of one of Kensington’s plusher, more pleasing-to-the-eye builds being treated like this.\nThere are many specific questions that must be asked — and answered — about this horrific fire. Most pressingly: how did a fire in one flat spread with such ferocious speed to the entire block? A flat-based fire can be a simple accident (though we don’t yet know if this fire was accidental or deliberate). But when such a fire moves upwards and upwards with nightmarish intensity, engulfing home after home, it’s not an accident. Then it becomes something else; then it becomes clear that the fire has been enabled by something, perhaps by the decisions and actions of others. In this case, recent refurbishment, including the addition of seemingly flammable cladding, raises serious questions about materials used on buildings and official fire regulations. Also, why don’t all tower blocks have sprinklers? And decent fire alarms that can actually be heard? These specific issues must be pored over, urgently, post this inferno.\nBut there are broader questions, too. Most importantly, there’s the housing crisis, the dearth of new build, and how this has helped to warp the housing market so that homes in Britain, and especially in London, are pretty much unaffordable to normal people. The failure of both Tory and Labour governments to build the millions of new homes Britain needs has messed up the economy and society in ways we sometimes fail to appreciate. Bank of England governor Mark Carney was right to warn in 2014 that ‘there are not sufficient houses [being] built in the UK’, and that this lack, this dearth, is ramping up house prices, intensifying borrowing, and storing up serious problems for ‘financial durability’.\nBut the housebuilding failure hasn’t only twisted prices and blown up economic bubbles — it has also had a dire impact on society, too, on community life, even on the value we attach to certain citizens. It has created a situation where developers, and the local councils who love them, tend always to have the super-rich in mind; tend to erect new builds they know will be snapped up by those flush with cash: wealthy foreigners or filthy-rich Brits. In the midst of this market-lighted process of gentrification, the poorer inhabitants of places like Kensington and Chelsea sometimes come to be seen as a pain, as squatters almost, whose towering blocks or state-funded homes are in essence vast concrete barriers to the making of huge amounts of money.\nAnd so do the poorer inhabitants of certain boroughs come to be seen, inexorably, as a problem, as pests, their concerns easily ignored. After all, wouldn’t it be better if they left? If they cleared the way for new opportunities for wealth creation for the few? This is the inhumanity unwittingly unleashed by our warped housing crisis, and by the recession more broadly, and it is, if you will forgive me, disgusting.\nSince that benighted building and the family homes it contains went up in flames 24 hours ago, there has been a rush to pin the blame on ‘evil’ individuals. We’ve seen an outburst of Tory-bashing in particular. Boris is to blame, for cutting fire services. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s new chief-of-staff, is also getting it in the neck for having allegedly ‘sat on’ a report about how tower blocks are vulnerable to fire. This craven search for the one evil Tory to blame for this calamity is also Dickensian. It’s a Dickensian breed of moralism that prefers to bash wicked individual landlords or nasty Scrooges rather than address the bigger social and economic underpinnings of tragedies like this. Finger-pointing and the desire to feel good and pompous become a substitute for examining how both Tory and Labour governments have helped to warp the housing question through their failures of housing ambition.\nI was born into overcrowded social housing in West London, not far from Grenfell. So I know something of how social-housing residents are mistreated, how they can come to be viewed as lesser citizens than those with money and influence, whether it’s by Labourites hectoring them for their ‘nasty neighbour’ behaviour or the rich wishing they would move on. It must stop. We have it in our power to ensure that nothing like the Grenfell fire ever happens again, if we ask the right and hard questions.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T18:00:37Z","url":"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/grenfell-tower-inferno-shames-london/"}

{"text":"Not content with starring in her own \"Will she or won't she?\" presidential soap opera, Sarah Palin offered a revision of Paul Revere's famous midnight ride – one of the best-known events in Amewrican history – that both provoked and confounded her critics.\nWhat was at worst a syntactic ambiguity on Palin's part during her bus tour last week became another instance of critics accusing her of historical ignorance, and her supporters just as insistently defending her from error – a battle that spilled over onto the historical event's Wikipedia entry.\nHe warned the British that they weren't going be taking away our arms, by ringing those bells, and making sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be secure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed.\nThe British armed forces' mission was to seize arms belonging to the nascent rebels, so Palin's right in a general sense, although one assumes Revere and the other riders' primary aim was to warn the rebels and their leaders about the British military move.\nAs it happened, Revere also did warn the British military directly, when he was captured by British troops and interrogated at gunpoint. Revere told them what he had been doing and according to his own account warned them that 500 armed militia were waiting.\nHere is what Paul Revere did. He warned the Americans that the British were coming, the British were coming, and they were going to try take our arms and we got to make sure that we were protecting ourselves and shoring up all of ammunitions and our firearms so that they couldn't take it.\nBut remember that the British had already been there, many soldiers for seven years in that area. And part of Paul Revere's ride – and it wasn't just one ride – he was a courier, he was a messenger. Part of his ride was to warn the British that we're already there. That, hey, you're not going to succeed. You're not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have. He did warn the British.\nSo, Sarah Palin claimed that Paul Revere was a Revolutionary-era NRA member whose famous ride was for a British audience, to let them know Americans were going to win the war because they believed in gun rights.\nPalin's aim – insofar as she had one – was to blow a dog-whistle for her supporters, turning the Revolutionary war into a tale about gun ownership. That's not historically inaccurate – it's the reason there is a second amendment defending the right to bear arms in the first place.\nBut her supporters couldn't resist trying to make history conform more closely to her version, by editing the Wikipedia entry covering Revere's ride. The rewriting was first spotted by the political website Little Green Footballs: \"Man, you've gotta almost admire the sheer blind dedication of Sarah Palin's wingnut acolytes.\"\nOfficial: What was the cause of the Civil War?\nOfficial: Wait, wait.

{"text":"It's a fantastic update to a favorite tool for chefs and bartenders.\nWiredA fantastic update to a favorite tool for chefs and bartenders. Improvements over the original version make everything better.\nTiredIt's a narrow niche for home use. Consider if you're into this kind of thing before purchasing and filing it away in a drawer after only one use. The screen filter also has a tendency to pop through the burn chamber.\nTrundle through as many fancy restaurant kitchens as I have and you'll start recognizing specialized tools, big and small: little offset spatulas, slablike flat-top griddles, high-powered Vitamix blenders, spoonulas. For years now, many of those kitchens also used something that looks like a cross between a black squirt gun and a battery-powered hookah.\nThis thing, the PolyScience Smoking Gun, uses a tiny fan to draw a flame across a teaspoon of wood chips or other combustibles to produce a steady stream of smoke, which it expels through a long tube. You can do some pretty cool things with it: I've seen chefs present food under a clear glass cloche full of smoke, lifting it tableside to reveal a dish; bartenders will smoke a glass, the booze, or an entire cocktail to impart varying degrees of smokiness. When I worked on The Willows Inn’s cookbook, Sea and Smoke, chef Blaine Wetzel would cold-smoke mussels in a smoker for four hours, sear them on the flat top to caramelize them, tuck them back in their shells, pop them in a tiny cedar box, pipe alder smoke into the box, and immediately walk it out into the dining room, where diners opened the box, sending a puff of smoke billowing toward the ceiling.\nDespite its ability to turn a dish or a drink into a showstopper, the original Smoking Gun, like that plastic squirt gun, feels a bit chintzy. It's also poorly balanced: Even in its stand, a tug on the tube can cause the whole thing to fall over and make a literal hot mess.\nVersion two, the Smoking Gun Pro ($150)—a joint venture between PolyScience and Breville—solves these problems and improves on the original in just about every way. The original, now referred to as the \"legacy\" version, is being phased out. In a confusing bit of marketing and nomenclature, there is also the Breville Smoking Gun (no PolyScience, no Pro, $100), with a smaller footprint, diminished capabilities, and less weight.\nThe Pro offers new features, like a large base for stability, a variable speed fan, and a big shiny removable metal barrel that gives it heft, durability, and undeniable cool. It's easily disassembled, and many of the components are dishwasher-safe. Comparing the new versions, the non-pro model looks like a cash grab. If, like most people, you've never heard of these things and are now considering one, save your pennies a little longer and go Pro.\nI went to see bartender Jamie Boudreau of the high-end Canon bar in Seattle, and there on the front corner of the bar sat his Smoking Gun Pro. For Boudreau, there are two ways to smoke a drink: in and around. \"In is for flavor more than aroma—you get a smokiness in the mouth,\" he says. To do this, he pours the booze in a decanter with smoke and gives it a quick shake. \"I lean toward the darker spirits. Clear spirits like gin are more delicate, and the smoke can overtake the drink.\"\nHe keeps this in mind making his Khaleesi cocktail. Boudreau brings a glass skull full of tea smoke to the table, adds a mix of Punt e Mes, Blanton's single-barrel bourbon, and some other lovely ingredients, gives it a quick shake, and pours immediately. Just two shakes, he says—more than that, and you risk the smoke overpowering the drink.\nFor the around technique, he pipes smoke into a clear smoking box, inundating either the glass or the entire drink in the terrarium-like cube: for example, he might smoke a Manhattan with strawberry tea. Boudreau is clearly a big fan of the Pro. His only quibble is that the screen the wood chips can pop right through the burn chamber (something I experienced during testing), which he avoids by cutting his own screen instead of using the smaller circles that come with the Smoking Gun.\n\"Other than that,\" he summarizes, \"everything is better.\"\nEverything about the Smoking Gun Pro is so much better that chefs and bartenders who have a legacy version ought to seriously consider replacing it. As for everyone else, do you really need one? Tough call. As my wife said, \"This wouldn't rate a spot on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Not even the frivolous end.\"\nWith further testing, particularly with food, I learned to think of the smoke more like a seasoning: A nice addition, but it doesn't completely change the meal. You can blend it into a soup or a salsa or whip it into mashed potatoes. You can smoke a salad. You can use all kinds of wood to make smoke or, like Boudreau, you can smoke tea leaves. It's showy and fun—and very easy to imagine someone buying it or receiving it as a gift, using it once, and never pulling it out of the drawer.\nThen again, what do I know about people? I bought a bottle of Famous Grouse and brought it, along with the Pro and a utility lighter, to poker night at my buddy Brian's house. We went out to his patio to keep the smoke detector from going off, had everyone try a taste of the \"regular\" whisky, then combined some with mesquite smoke in an empty glass bottle, gave it two quick shakes, and poured a round of shots. The mesquite gave the Scotch a pleasant burnt-marshmallow flavor that everybody was into. Several hands later, Brian pulled out a bottle of Cazadores Reposado and we ran the same experiment on tequila. Here the results were mixed, but it was a lot of fun.\nIn short, it was a big, showy success, the guys got really into it, and we all tottered off into the night with a smoky buzz.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T12:10:20Z","url":"https://www.wired.com/2017/05/review-polyscience-smoking-gun-pro/"}

For Upton, getting older means sitting in the mall food court and staring longingly at plates going by, not the attractive young women carrying them. While this is to him a sign of deterioration, it's representative of MCGA that Upton would never consider that the food-carrying women think it's a major improvement. Allen is more explicitly sour, having crossed over into that late-middle-age period where men are so hen-pecked that it gets a big laugh when Allen says something like, \"I've been married 32 years, so it's not like I'm a man anymore anyway.\"\nIf they're the grumpy gramps of the tour, Ross Bennett is the weird uncle, with sproingy hair, thick glasses and a persona he describes as \"the science teacher that (all the students) suspected smokes pot.\" Though sentimentality was thickest with Bennett, it was also gentlest, culminating with a hilarious set-closing routine about sledding, the differences between toboggans and flying saucers and being mummified in scarf wrapped around his head so many times that it felt as if his mother was planning to pull-start a lawnmower.\nAbsolutely necessary to this mix is the ostensible opener/emcee, David Earl Reed, a black comic and morning-radio host in York, Pa., who is supremely skilled at zinging white audiences just up to their comfort levels. In a set that was as long as each of the others', Reed was masterful in his crowd work, riffing brilliantly on interactions with the audience, from late-comers to a monosyllabic 20something who, when asked about his career, said only, but enthusiastically, \"Concrete!\"\nNoting a black-white interracial couple sitting near the front, Reed said, \"You know what they say: Once you go black ....\"\nHe trailed off, letting the audience mentally fill in what they thought was coming. What he actually said was far more pointed than a a rhyming, sexually based cliché: \"Once you go black, your family leaves.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-24T06:44:32Z","url":"https://www.timesunion.com/7day-breaking/article/Make-Comedy-Great-Again-Tour-a-clear-hit-13362231.php"}

{"text":"Take 5: How can we stop being jerky customers?\nThe customer may not always be right. What are some circumstances where they could be wrong?\nIn a recent trip to a grocery store, I grabbed my usual few items in a hand basket and took my wares to the cashier's counter. I set the basket on the table (not a conveyor belt, just a small table) and started to reach for my wallet.\nI looked up and the cashier was just staring at the basket, not moving. I asked her if everything was OK, and she replied, \"I never remove items from baskets.\"\nI didn't realize that was a thing. I simply thought the effort to grab something from inside a basket was the same as it was on a table. I'm happy to learn the right way to be, so it wasn't a big deal to do as she wanted.\nGot to thinking: Have I been a jerk all this time and not known? Facebook opinions were 50-50 on whether that's truly an etiquette thing or whether she was just cranky.\nWhat else have I been flubbing up? I asked friends to explain what circumstances they wished customers understood about jobs they had. In other words, when are customers just not right?\nThe general truth seems to be that people who've never worked in customer service have unrealistic expectations.\nInconsiderate cell phone users during checkout, people who get mad at employees if the store is out of the product they seek, people who make a line of people behind them wait while they get something they forgot and people who treat pharmacists like they only count pills for a living were just a few quick hits my friends offered to support that truth.\nSchool teacher Sylvia Hammons asked me to remind people that school is not a daycare. Dropping kids off early or coming to pick them up late has a ripple effect people generally forget.\n\"While families are 'our customers,' they need to understand that teachers have a schedule to follow, too, and dropping kids off early and picking them up late prevents teachers from getting other responsibilities done. I’d say probably the same for sports coaches,\" she said.\nPlanning for these circumstances is important. Part of planning, however, isn't giving your sick kid Tylenol that wears off in two hours so everyone ultimately has to deal with it (nurses, parents, teachers, classmates) anyway.\nFormer Community Press writer Liz Carey gave another example: Her husband used to work at CompUSA where a woman screamed at him for 15 minutes because his company didn't sell film for her digital camera. I'll give you a second to reread that.\nFor her contribution, Leslie Kohlman talked about the bane of restaurant managers: The habitual complainers who come in to get free meals. She said, \"I finally told a family you cost me money every time you walk in the door.\"\nI waited tables at Ground Round when the company had penny-per-pound day for kids meals. You'd be surprised how hard people will work to avoid paying for meals, even 65-cent dinners.\nTara Stroud had another restaurant issue. Some people don't understand how reservations/call-ahead/seating issues work. \"So many factors come into play when seating guests, i.e. party size, time of arrival, closed sections, smoking/non-smoking (used to), etc. I can’t tell you how many times I had to field a customer complaint because of how they thought it should go. Everyone knows more than the employees when they want to be seated.\"\nNow, it's understandable what most consumers deal with: Tight home budgets, too many stressors and too much to do with no time to do it. However, no one gets paid enough to be a customer's human fidget spinner.\nIt's sad people talk to customer service workers in manners they'd never tolerate someone talking to their own loved ones.\nFor the record, when I have a handheld basket at the grocery store, I now ask cashiers if they want me to remove items from those baskets. So far, no one cared one way or the other, but it was nice to ask.\nThe Golden Rule isn't so hard to remember.\nMelanie Laughman is the digital preps planning editor for high school sports. She periodically writes a column, Take 5, on family-related issues.

{"text":"Alaska's distilleries can no longer serve mixed drinks to customers, the state agency overseeing alcohol ruled Tuesday.\nIn a 3-1 vote, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board decided that distilleries — which make vodka, gin and other types of distilled alcohol — have to stop serving cocktails in their tasting rooms. The ruling may change how the state's distilleries do business.\nThe decision centered around vague language in Alaska's laws that says the businesses may serve \"the distillery's product\" to customers. After complaints landed at the state regulatory office this summer, months of debate followed about exactly what that meant and how it was being applied in distilleries across the state.\nTuesday's vote clarified that the \"product\" is \"distilled spirit made or distilled in the licensed facility,\" and can't include other things like tonic or other mixers.\nBut, distilleries will be allowed to \"separately serve other types of nonalcoholic mixers/garnishes,\" Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office Director Erika McConnell wrote in an email.\nThat means a distillery could serve a customer two glasses, one with gin, and the other with tonic, which the customer could then mix themselves.\nDistilleries say they've been serving cocktails since 2014, when legislators passed a bill allowing for distillery tasting rooms. Alaska regulators said that they didn't know distilleries were selling cocktails for the past three years.\n\"The purpose of the law was to allow the distilling industry to promote and sell our products directly to the consumer, just like the breweries do,\" Heather Shade, co-owner of Port Chilkoot Distillery in Haines, wrote in public comment to the board.\n\"Spirits are unique in the way that they are prepared and there is no reason to limit how we serve them,\" Shade wrote.\nBars spoke out against the practice. The Alaska Cabaret, Hotel, Restaurant and Retailers Association — known as CHARR – said it would never have supported allowing for tasting rooms if it had known they would become \"de facto bars.\"\nDistilleries said that rules were put in place specifically to prevent them from becoming bars. Customers may only have 3 ounces of alcohol. Alcohol can't be served after 8 p.m. Entertainment is banned. Bar stools are not allowed.\nAs of September, nine distilleries were operating in Alaska. Anchorage Distillery is the only one in Alaska's largest city.\nMore than 500 pages of public comment were submitted in advance of Tuesday's meeting.\nMcConnell wrote that the Department of Law would receive the adopted regulation next week. After the agency's review, the adopted regulations will be sent to Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott. Regulation is effective 30 days after he signs it.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T05:01:29Z","url":"https://www.adn.com/business-economy/2018/01/23/no-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules/?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adn.com%2Fbusiness-economy%2F2018%2F01%2F23%2Fno-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules%2F%3FreturnUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.adn.com%252Fbusiness-economy%252F2018%252F01%252F23%252Fno-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules%252F%26cancelUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.adn.com%252Fbusiness-economy%252F2018%252F01%252F23%252Fno-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules%252F%26op%3Dlink&cancelUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adn.com%2Fbusiness-economy%2F2018%2F01%2F23%2Fno-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules%2F%3FreturnUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.adn.com%252Fbusiness-economy%252F2018%252F01%252F23%252Fno-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules%252F%26cancelUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.adn.com%252Fbusiness-economy%252F2018%252F01%252F23%252Fno-mixed-drinks-allowed-at-alaska-distilleries-state-alcohol-board-rules%252F%26op%3Dlink&op=link"}

{"text":"\"Country Music Hair\" author Erin Duvall breaks down the 'dos.\nYou can't think about country music without thinking about hair. Whenever anyone talks about Dolly Parton, her look is mentioned in the same breath as her unparalleled songwriting ability and angelic voice. Willie Nelson is the Red Headed Stranger; his braids are as iconic as his illegal drug habit. That's why I focused on the evolution of hairstyles in country music for my new book Country Music Hair. From the 1960s to today, my first book is a tribute to the iconic hairstyles we loved on our favorite artists.\nWillie Nelson, \"The Red Headed Stranger\"\nIn my opinion, there has been no greater hair transformation in country music history than that of Willie Nelson. Most fans who see pictures of the icon in the 1960s cannot recognize him thanks to his clean-cut look. The 1970s brought shoulder-length hair and the first signs of what was to come. By the '80s, Nelson had become the man we think of today, full red braids and a signature bandana.\nOne of my favorite quotes attributed to Dolly Parton is \"People ask me how long it takes to do my hair and I say, 'I don't know, I'm never there.'\" Parton has worn everything from a bouffant to long layers, but it's never been her real hair. Stylist Cheryl Riddle is responsible for getting each wig ready to wear, but surprisingly Parton still does her own makeup to this day.\nKelsea Ballerini is in the new class of country stars, finding her own way by honoring those who came before her. When it comes to hair, Ballerini doesn't go full wig, but she's a big supporter of clip-in hair extensions. Her hair is stick straight and, especially in performance situations, clip-ins hold curl (and thus style) despite the environmental conditions.\nPatsy Cline is arguably one of the most iconic voices in country music. Her style is stamped in time as well. Reba's stylist Neil Robison explains in Country Music Hair that Cline likely had naturally curly hair and therefore it was a laborious process to get her signature wave. Stylist Earl Cox agrees, sharing a story from his client Barbara Mandrell, who actually styled Cline's hair every night when she was playing steel guitar for the songstress in her teens.\nCountry Music Hair also looks at the relationships that fans have with the 'dos of their favorite artists. In 1996, Faith Hill famously chopped off her long locks in what has become known as the \"Cut Heard Round the World.\" Most recently, Ali Ryan of the Dry House Nashville started a new movement when she transformed Jake Owen by cutting his established shoulder-length hair to this clean-cut look. Granted, there was far less outcry this time around as happy fans praised Ryan's work.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T22:43:23Z","url":"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7647530/biggest-moments-country-music-hair-history"}

{"text":"Which Irish names are making a comeback?\nFor the fifth year in a row, Emily was the most popular female baby name in Ireland in 2015. Emily finished the year ahead of Emma, Ava, Sophie and Amelia – rounding out the top five – and is again number one among girls’ baby names. Emily has ruled the roost without interruption since 2010.\nJack, again, took the crown on the male list as it has for the past eight years. Apart from slight changes in the order, the top five male baby names in 2015 – Jack, James, Daniel, Conor and Sean – are exactly as they have been since 2007. Only one new name has even made even the top 100 boys’ list. As it happens, four out of five of the top five male names have remained in the top five since 1998, almost two whole decades.\nGeorge has leaped in popularity both last year and this year, probably thanks to England’s Prince George who probably has won some fans in Ireland based on the number of new-born baby boys sharing his name. George rose from 103rd to 90th.\nOllie also continues to stride up the table, rising most in popularity of all the names on the list. Ollie moved from 87th in 2014 to 66th place in 2015.\nOn the girls’ side, Annabelle, Mila, and Rosie were three new names to make the top 100, with Mila being the highest climbing name on either list, rising from 142nd place in 2014 to 88th place in 2015.\nEmily & Daniel were the most popular baby names on passport applications in Ireland last year.\nOut of the 4,487 different girls’ names registered are some more unusual ones, including Paris, Nelly, Dakota, Kim, Pixie and Sabina.\nOn the male list, which saw 3,475 different boys’ names registered, we may be able to detect the influence of One Direction given the popularity of Zayn among other outsider choices including Barra, Pauric, Gus, Romeo and Otis.\nZayn made the top 100 baby names in Ireland. Words fail me.\nInterestingly, the statistics recently published by the Irish Central Statistics Office compare the names chosen by parents who both stated they were Irish nationals, compared to parents who claimed another nationality.\nJack also remained the popular choice for a boy among UK parents, while Noah was the most popular choice for Europeans from countries other than Ireland or the UK. Muhammed was the most popular choice for boys whose parents came from outside Europe.\nIsla and Chloe were the top picks for girls' names among UK parents while Chloe, Emma, and Julia were popular with other European parents. In 2015, Fatima was the name of choice for baby girls born in Ireland to parents who are not from Europe.\nThe recent data also compared the top names of 2015 to those in 1965 when John and Mary reigned supreme.\nOf this year’s top five boys’ names, only James appeared in 1965's top five while none of 2015’s top girls’ picks were in 1965’s top monikers. In 1965, Mary, Margaret, Catherine, Anne, and Ann came top of the pile, of which, Mary was the only name to even make the top 100 in 2015.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T00:54:20Z","url":"https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/top-baby-names-in-ireland-for-2015-some-irish-names-make-a-comeback"}

Voters apparently were voiding their votes by accident while trying to review them, and having to redo their ballots. The delays caused longer lines than normal.\nAlso in Philadelphia, the Republican City Committee (search) filed a lawsuit Tuesday asking a federal judge to give them more time to challenge absentee ballots cast by Democrats. The suit demands that the city turn over a list of every city resident who received an absentee ballot, and then delay counting any of their votes until at least Nov. 5 to give the GOP time to investigate whether any ballots were cast by ineligible people.\nA lawyer for John Kerry&apos;s campaign in Pennsylvania said some people were prevented from voting when at least a dozen Allegheny County precincts ran out of provisional ballots.

In 1959, Karnow reported on the first two American deaths in Vietnam, not suspecting that tens of thousands would follow.\nInto the 1970s, Karnow would cover the war off and on for Time, The Washington Post and other publications and then draw upon his experience for an epic PBS documentary and for the million-selling “Vietnam: A History,” published in 1983 and widely regarded as an essential, even-handed summation.\nKarnow’s “In Our Image,” a companion to a PBS documentary on the Philippines, won the Pulitzer in 1990. His other books included “Mao and China,” which in 1973 received a National Book Award nomination, and “Paris in The Fifties,” a memoir published in 1997.\nA fellow Vietnam reporter, Morley Safer, would describe Karnow as the embodiment of “the wise old Asian hand.” Karnow was known for his precision and research—his Vietnam book reaches back to ancient times—and his willingness to see past his own beliefs. He was a critic of the Vietnam War (and a name on President Nixon’s enemies list) who still found cruelty and incompetence among the North Vietnamese. His friendship with Philippines leader Corazon Aquino did not stop him from criticizing her presidency.\nA salesman’s son, Karnow was born in New York in 1925 and by high school was writing radio plays and editing the school’s paper, a job he also held at the Harvard Crimson. He first lived in Asia during World War II when he served throughout the region in the Army Air Corps. Back in the U.S., he majored in European history and literature at Harvard, from which he graduated in 1947.\nHe began sending dispatches to a Connecticut weekly, where the owner was a friend, and in 1950 was hired as a researcher at Time. Promoted to correspondent, he would cover strikes, race car driving and the beginning of the French conflict with Algeria, but also interviewed Audrey Hepburn (“a memorable if regrettably brief encounter”) fashion designer Christian Dior and director John Huston, who smoked cigars, knocked back Irish whiskies and rambled about the meaning of Humphrey Bogart. Friends and acquaintances included Norman Mailer, James Baldwin and John Kenneth Galbraith.\nKarnow’s first book was the text for “Southeast Asia,” an illustrated Life World Library release published in 1962, before the U.S. committed ground troops to Vietnam. It was partly a Cold War time capsule, preoccupied with Communist influence, but was also skeptical enough of official policy to anticipate the fall of a key American ally, South Vietnamese president Ngo Dihn Diem, an event that helped lead to greater American involvement.\nLike so many others, Karnow initially supported the war and believed in the “domino theory,” which asserted that if South Vietnam were to fall to communism its neighbors would too.\nBut by war’s end, Karnow agreed with the soldier asked by a reporter in 1968 what he thought of the conflict: “It stinks,” was the reply.\n“There are not many carefully delineated judgments in the book. But that is more a comment than the criticism it might be, for Mr. Karnow does not claim to have reached a sweeping verdict on the war,” Douglas Pike, a former U.S. government official in Vietnam who became a leading authority on the war, wrote for The New York Times in a 1983 review.\nThe PBS series won six Emmys, a Peabody and a Polk and was the highest-rated documentary at the time for public television, with an average of 9.7 million viewers per episode. Along with much praise came criticism from the left and right. The liberal weekly The Nation faulted Karnow for “little analysis and much waffling.” Conservatives were so angered by the documentary that PBS agreed to let the right-wing Accuracy in Media air a rebuttal, “Television’s Vietnam: The Real Story,” which in turn was criticized as a show of weakness by PBS.\nKarnow completed no books after “Paris in the Fifties.” He attempted a study of Asians in the U.S., which he abandoned; a history of Jewish humor that never advanced beyond an outline; and a second memoir, with such working titles as “Interesting Times” and “Out of Asia.” He also cared for his ailing wife, Annette, who died of cancer in 2009. A previous marriage, to Claude Sarraute (daughter of French novelist Nathalie Sarraute), ended in divorce in 1955. Karnow had three children.\nHe was often called on for speeches, panel discussions and television appearances and asked for his opinions on current affairs. One query came in 2009, through his old friend Richard Holbrooke, at the time the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan. Holbrooke wanted advice on U.S. policy in Afghanistan and put Karnow on the phone with Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander. Karnow and the general discussed similarities between the wars in Afghanistan and Vietnam.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T15:07:03Z","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2013/01/27/karnow-vietnam-reporter-historian-dies-at-age-87/"}

{"text":"Roadwork continues in Madison Twp.\nWEST POINT — Madison Township’s road crew continues its work on potholes and cleanup of trees following recent storms.\nIn his report last Wednesday to trustees, road foreman Gary Mitchell announced the road crew is currently in the middle of hot patching various roads throughout the township and will be continuing its efforts until entirely finished.\nMitchell reported one request for work for a culvert pipe cleanout on McDonald has been put on hold until the hot patching process is complete.\nDue to recent storms, several trees have been reported down, including on Cream Ridge Road and throughout Bear Hollow. Mitchell said while the Cream Ridge tree has been cleaned up, additional work had to be done at Bear Hollow, resulting in the road being temporarily closed.\n” … we had to shut down the road for one day before a power line and a telephone pole down there,” he explained.\nMitchell also said, due to mechanical problems with the mower, crews have not been able to continue mowing. He also stated loggers have been looking at property on Cannons Mill Road and will be there for a couple weeks. He said they may consider placing a bid on the property, but was not certain.\nIn addition, Mitchell requested the board approve purchases of limestone material which will be used for winter road clearing, along with ash which has been picked up recently. The board approved motions to purchase 500 tons of limestone material. The board, however, is waiting on winter salt after learning that it would cost $62 per ton.\n— During public comment, Torma Road resident Todd Mays asked the board about the township’s electrical co-op program and inquired who is the electrical provider for the township following recent news of the bankruptcy and pending purchase of FirstEnergy.\nTrustee Roger Walker said to his knowledge all contracts would be honored with the new company. Fiscal Officer Tiffany Chetock stated there was an opt-out program, but the township would need to look into the information.\nAlso in public comment, Skip Hamilton asked trustees about the switching plant for South Field Energy on state Route 45 in the township and whether or not the township will be able to receive any money from the plant. Chairman Wayne Chamberlain advised Hamilton the township will receive some of the tax money.\n— Trustees approved a motion to create a separate emergency fund for any proceeds the West Point Fire Department may receive for fire damage and work. The motion was made at the request of the state auditor’s office, which recommended the township no longer place those funds in the General Fund and instead deposit them into a different fund.\nAlso related to finances, trustees approved the payment of the bills amounting to $25,762.65, along with seven purchase orders.\nThe next regular meeting is scheduled 6 p.m. Sept. 26 at the Madison Township Garage meeting room on state Route 45.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T13:58:15Z","url":"http://www.reviewonline.com/news/local-news/2018/09/roadwork-continues-in-madison-twp/"}
{"text":"At The U.S. Olympic Trials, Mixed Opinions About Russian Doping Scandal : The Torch The Russian scandal is a hot topic at the U.S. track and field Olympic Trials. Some feel individual Russian athletes should be allowed to compete if they're clean, others support a blanket ban.\nThere will be a decision soon about whether some Russian track and field athletes can compete in the Olympics next month in Rio. This week, Russia filed an appeal after its track federation was banned because of state-sponsored doping. Despite efforts to stop it, doping is a persistent problem in track and field as NPR's Tom Goldman reports from the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore.\nTOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: It didn't take long in Eugene - matter of fact the first day of the trials - a brilliant blue sky day. There was a reminder of the shadow of doping.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Medal ceremony. Shot put men.\nGOLDMAN: A medal ceremony is a happy moment. The winner on this day smiled as he stood wearing a victory wreath on his head. But it was bittersweet, coming 12 years late.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Gold medalist and 2004 Olympic champion representing the USA, Adam Nelson.\nGOLDMAN: Adam Nelson won a silver medal in the 2004 Olympic shot put competition. A few years ago, the gold medalist tested positive for a banned drug in retroactive testing, meaning Nelson was the winner. But then one of the most underwhelming victory moments ever - the gold medal was hand delivered to Nelson in 2013 in a food court at the Atlanta airport. Track officials in Eugene thought Nelson deserved better, so did the thousands of fans who cheered him last week at Hayward Field. Not long after those cheers, there were more reminders.\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Gatlin and Bromell. Gatlin, Bromell.\nGOLDMAN: America's best sprinter proved it again in Eugene. Justin Gatlin won the 100-meter final Sunday in 9.80 seconds. That's a world best time this year. But during the weekend, about 30 people at Hayward Field wore T-shirts with the slogan runners against doping. It was a targeted and quiet protest against Gatlin and fellow sprinter Tyson Gay. Both have served doping suspensions. Thirty-four-year-old Gatlin served two.\nDoping is a charged issue for him, but in Eugene, Gatlin was willing to talk about the Russian scandal. I asked him whether some athletes who prove they're clean should be able to go to Rio, even though their track federation is banned.\nJUSTIN GATLIN: At the end of the day, I mean, you got to think about fair is fair. You know, if an athlete has come and he's been tested or she's been tested, and they've passed a test, I don't think they should, you know, basically prosecuted or make a statement with other people who have done wrong.\nGOLDMAN: Distance runner Stephanie Bruce is sponsored by Oiselle. That's the apparel company that organized the T-shirt protest. For Bruce, the situation is murkier with the Russian athletes who protest their innocence.\nSTEPHANIE BRUCE: How long have you been running in a culture like that and you don't know that it's going on and you haven't come forward? Like, you are totally oblivious that coaches or - you know what I mean? So that seems strange to me.\nGOLDMAN: It's not surprising that Adam Nelson, the man in the belated ceremony, takes a hardest line. He's a long-time anti-doping Fair Play advocate, but he's also a victim of doping. He was quoted as saying this, the reality is you make a ban on a country and then you allow the athletes to compete. It sends a mixed message.\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport is expected to decide by July 21 whether individual Russian athletes can compete in Rio. If the decision is no, it will be the first time that country isn't part of the Olympics' most prominent sport - track and field - since the former Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 LA Summer Games.

{"text":"Blink to take pictures using the new Google Glass firmware?\nGoogle Glass still hasn't been released to the masses and we're already getting word of a second version in the works. But back to the now and Google has come up with a firmware update for the model currently being used by Explorers. We can expect blink controls, more specific voice commands and music control.\nThe latest XE10 update, studied by Android Police, appears to offer some exciting blink control options. A \"wink for photo\" function is found in the new build as does the option to control something using a \"double blink\". While this sounds great it might still be held back by Google because of privacy concerns.\nMusic has also had an upgrade with a quick control command of \"play music\" added. This will likely be a way of accessing and controlling music from your phone. It also includes a layout for music items like album art, album name, track name and artist name. Also you should be able to control play, next, previous, pause and stop. A new radio icon has been added which could be used for Play Music's All Access radio channels.\nApp specific controls have also been added like \"take note\" to instantly record in Evernote, or \"post update\" to add to your Path account. Other controls include: \"find a recipe\", \"check me in\", \"call me a car\", \"add a calendar event\", \"learn a song\", \"start a run\", \"translate this\", and \"tune an instrument\". All very cool potential uses but whether these controls will have apps to support them anytime soon is another matter.\nPerhaps the most exciting new control, which likely won't be usable for some time, is \"create a 3D model\". Imagine looking at an object and that being enough to create a file for 3D printing. The mind boggles.\nThe XE10 update will launch next month.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T22:21:22Z","url":"https://www.pocket-lint.com/ar-vr/news/google/124438-blink-to-take-pictures-using-the-new-google-glass-firmware"}

{"text":"The “car chase” is another carryover from The Bourne Identity that Director Greengrass includes yet improves upon. Supremacy takes the cliché car chase, injects it with steroids, and chases it with a Red Bull. The climax is easily the best car chase on screen in ten years. It’s better than the The Matrix: Reloaded. Why? Supremacy isn't hindered by CGI. The chase is intense and real. When Bourne’s car spins out of control and is simultaneously blind-sided by another car, I dare you not to flinch.\nAs my wife has mentioned many times before, Matt Damon is a good looking man. She also mentions his lovely smile. Well, you won’t see Damon’s pearly whites in The Bourne Supremacy, but you will see why he’s one of the most talented actors of his generation. Forget about his buddy Ben Affleck, Damon knows how to capture the audience’s attention with his talent not his girlfriends.\nWhen Paula Landy’s (Joan Allen) CIA sting ends terribly, the few clues left behind lead her to believe Jason Bourne (Damon) has ended his retirement. Her subsequent investigation of Bourne uncovers the closed Operation “Treadstone” and opens doors that others wish to remain sealed.\nHundreds of miles away, the real Jason Bourne enjoys a peaceful yet cautious life with Marie (Franka Potente). Unbeknownst to him, a Russian Kingpin and an American traitor plan on making Jason Bourne’s retirement, permanent. After the hired assassin Kirill (Karl Urban) attempts to kill him, a resulting tragedy propels Bourne back towards the mysterious life that haunts his nights.\nBourne Identity director Doug Lyman brought us a thriller that was restrained until action was warranted. When the action began, it was relentless, cold, and efficient much like Bourne himself. Lyman rescued the secret agent genre from Spy Kids and Agent Cody Banks with a thriller that while grounded in realism, explodes upon the screen with a fury that no silly kid movie can hope to match.\nLyman passed on directing The Bourne Supremacy, but thankfully Paul Greengrass took the helm and kept Supremacy faithful to Lyman’s vision. The major complaint one could find with Greengrass’ style is an overuse of hand-held camera shots used to represent the cloudy/jumbled bits of memory floating in Bourne’s head. I thought it worked well enough, however I can imagine some viewers finding it distracting.\nThe key to both movies is Matt Damon’s portrayal of Bourne. With minimal dialogue, Damon gives a complicated performance as a man who struggles to discover who he was while consciously trying to distance himself from his past. Bourne is an assassin who needs amnesia to discover who he really should have been. Only Damon’s talents could have shown us this. Do you really think his buddy Affleck could pull this off? What about Paul Walker or Vin Diesel? I don’t think so. Amongst his peers, Damon is in an acting class by himself.\nWhether Lyman’s vision or the directing of Greengrass can claim responsibility for The Bourne Supremacy’s is open to debate. I don’t care. At the very least, Greengrass knew not to screw up a good thing. With Matt Damon establishing himself as a talented and bankable star, The Bourne Supremacy will reign supreme at the box office and in the action-thriller genre.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T04:19:53Z","url":"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Bourne-Supremacy-581.html"}

{"text":"Kent State University Urban Design CollaborativeA rendering of the proposed Rivergate Park.\nThe Cleveland Rowing Foundation's project to create a riverfront park in Cleveland scored its third big grant in two days today with a $200,000 donation from the George Gund Foundation. The grant follows $550,000 in donations announced Tuesday by Peter Lewis and the Cleveland Foundation.\nGund Foundation trustees voted around 2 p.m. to make the gift, said senior program officer John Mitterholzer. The money will be channeled to the project through the non-profit Trust for Public Land, Mitterholzer said.\nThe goal of Rivergate is to turn 7 acres owned by the former Commodore's Club Marina on Columbus Road Peninsula into a cluster of boathouses for rowing shells, caneos, kayaks and dragon boats. The rowing foundation, an umbrella organization for high school, collegiate and adult rowing organizations with 850 members, currently occupies rented facilities on Scranton Road Peninsula, one river-bend south of the Commodore's Club site.\nJon Adams, co-chairman of the Rivergate Fund, said he was elated by the Gund announcement.\nAdams said the Gund grant brings the Rivergate project to within $700,000 of the $3.2 million price for the property. Rivergate advocates have a purchase option that expires July 31.\n\"It's just wonderful to get this broad-based community support for the project,\" he said. \"It speaks to the fact that people see the vision and benefit of creating a riverfront park and preserving public access for canoeing, kayaking, rowing – healthy, human-powered sports.\"\nIn the case of the Gund foundation, Adams' description of \"seeing\" the vision was literally true.\nMitterholzer said members of the Gund family who serve on the foundation board could look out of the organization's officers in the Guildhall Building at 45 Prospect Ave., and see the site on Columbus Road Peninsula.\n\"We think it's a transformative project, because we can see what's happening down there, and it was fun because we could show the board through the window,\" Mitterholzer said.\nAdams said Rivergate advocates are confident they'll complete fundraising or obtain a bridge loan in time to meet the July 31 deadline on the purchase option, and will be able to open for business in August.\n\"Because the site already has two buildings, one of which is perfect for our current boathouse storage needs, we can be up and running very quickly,\" he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T20:43:29Z","url":"http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2010/07/rivergate_park_project_receive.html"}
{"text":"A report by the Wall Street Journal suggests that Dell could be on the verge of becoming a public company once again.\nThe deal could be announced as soon as later today and -- if the cited sources close to Dell are correct -- it would see the company swapping the \"trading stock\" it created when it bought EMC a couple of years ago. It would simplify Dell's current structure, seen by many as overly complicated, and make use of the stock that tracks VMware Inc.\nThe deal is not yet thought to have been finalized, and the paper warns that there is still a chance it could fall through. While the tracking stock that would facilitate the change has doubled in value, Michael Dell has previously stated a preference for being a private company -- which Dell has been since 2013. With the value of VMware continuing to grow, it's possible that investors might oppose the idea of using the stock at the moment.\nThe expected move, which would help simplify Dell's complicated ownership structure, is the culmination of a strategic review the company has been conducting for months. Other options it considered include a combination with VMware itself or a straight initial public offering, the company has said.\nThe tracking stock was created as a way to help finance Dell's purchase of storage pioneer EMC in 2016. The deal was largely in cash, but the remainder was paid via the new security that was linked to a portion of EMC's interest in the VMware business, which provides cloud-infrastructure services.\nIssuing the tracking stock meant Dell didn't have to raise quite as much money to finance the deal.\nThe tracking stock has nearly doubled in value since it was issued, closing Friday at $84.58.\nShould Dell become a public company once again, it's not entirely clear what will happen to VMware -- although it should be possible for it to continue to operate as it currently does.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T08:38:27Z","url":"https://betanews.com/2018/07/02/dell-goes-public-deal/"}
{"text":"Heavy rain hammered Connecticut during Monday morning’s commute, causing spinouts and a roof collapse, while wind and flooding may lie ahead.\nThe sun was shining brightly in Hartford by late morning, only to give way to more rain early in the afternoon. A flood warning for the Connecticut River in Hartford and Middlesex counties is in effect. The river is expected to exceed flood stage Tuesday in Hartford, the Thompsonville section of Enfield and in the Middle Haddam section of East Hampton.\nBefore dawn, water pooled on highways and torrential downpours cut visibility, causing some truckers to pull over rather than try to make their way through the driving rain.\nSome crashes and spinouts were reported in the Hartford area, although it wasn’t clear if weather was a factor in all of them. One car appeared to have slid off I-91 into the center median in Windsor about 6:30 a.m., and a truck overturned on I-95 north in Stamford, causing authorities to close the highway.\nTrees fell on power lines in Sherman and Goshen, closing roads, according to the state Department of Transportation. A combined 44 customers in those towns were without power at 8 a.m., while in Sharon, also in the northwest corner, 102 customers lacked electricity.\nOn the other side of the state, in Woodstock, 572 customers had no power, according to Eversource.\nIn the Pawcatuck section of Stonington, the top floors and roof of a long-vacant brick mill collapsed early Monday, police said.

{"text":"We share a lot of things with our Malaysian neighbors. Borneo, which holds the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, and is just a stone’s throw away … physically, culturally and linguistically. The two Malaysian states are familiar territory for me. I used to frequent them in the ’80s and ’90s as a site planning and landscape architectural consultant for real estate and resort developments there.\nI flew in from Singapore, where I was based for over a dozen years. I remember having to take small planes from there to Kuching and from there hop across Sibu, Bintulu and to Miri, where I had most of my projects. I felt like an Indiana Jones, albeit without the bullwhip and sidearm.\nKuching’s cool cats are used for all of the city’s major monuments.\nTimes have changed and that was two decades ago. I visited Kuching recently and was impressed with the extent of development. First, the airport has transformed from a utilitarian box into a well-designed terminal with distinctive Sawarakan touches (something we could learn from). The City of Kuching has grown, too, but from all indications, its growth has been well managed.\nThe ride into the city is bereft of billboards and the creeping blights that line most of our provincial destinations. The cityscape, though obviously not as dense as our provincial cities, is rational, consistently clean, tree-lined, and green. We also got to our hotel within 15 minutes (compared to the hour or two required in major destinations in the Philippines).\nKuching’s name comes from the Malaysian word for cat similar to ours. The actual etymology is that the name comes from the fruit mata-kuching (whose seeds look like cat’s eyes). The city uses this name and theme consistently, a branding exercise that we can again learn from.\nOur hotel was one of several comfortable accomodations lining the city’s picturesque Kuching River. The river, like our Pasig, was and still is the lifeblood of the city. It is used to connect the city to the lush tropical hinterlands and the sea.\nMost of the city is built on the southern side of the river, much like Iloilo city. The historic core is a mainly a pre-independence colonial city, when the white rajahs ruled Borneo; a long story we don’t have space for here, but a colorful one that makes the city’s story a compelling one.\nKuching’s crocs are a lively bunch — this one in bronze guards the Esplanade plaza.\nIn the boom of the ’80s, the city (and the State of Sarawak’s Development Corporation) made a decision to rationally plan for growth … both from the overall context of the economy and from a specific goal of developing tourism.\nThe direction taken was to conserve the city’s historic resources of architecture and culture, as well as to revive the waterfront. The riverside had deteriorated into a parking lot and the city turned its back to it. A new esplanade was planned, incorporating existing structures but also improving the urban design and landscape architecture to accommodate spaces for modern life and to make it attractive to visitors.\nThe modern Kuching esplanade was completed in the early ’90s and immediately caught the attention of tourists regionally and internationally. The esplanade also helped to link one side of the city with the other and improved real estate value immensely.\nThe esplanade provided venues for community and state-wide events. The central plaza at one end provided a front door to the city from the river. Two view towers also marked this plaza and allowed boarding points for river boats (which increased in operation into today’s regular tourist cruises).\nKayaking is super kool in Kuching.\nThe espalanade’s success is seen in its popularity with locals. It is used for early morning jogging and tai chi. Children frequent it on weekends and food kiosks make it a rendezvous for teenagers.\nThe Kuching River has also been cleaned up (not that it was dirty). Kayaking is a growing sport and local schools hold competitions. The cleaned-up river and waterfront also led to the general sprucing up of the rest of the city and I saw little in the way of garbage or unkempt sites anywhere we went.\nWe (a bunch of international journalists and I) also came to Kuching for their world-renowned Rainforest World Music Festival. The festival, which started in 1997, is now a key date in the festival circuit world-wide.\nThe Rainforest Festival was a short bus ride into where else but the rainforest. The festival featured what else but world music by groups from Africa, South America, and Asia …thank God, there were no pop groups, Beiber or Gaga wannabees. And yes, beer flowed freely (if you’re wondering). A wonderful time was had by all. We went home quite satisfied with the festivities’ overflowing menu of music, food, and spirits (the locals have also apparently taken to western (mostly Australian) wine … with good chardonays, shirazs, cabernet sauvignons available from kiosks.\nCool Kuching river cruises are available every day.\nI spent the last day in Kuching walking up and down the one-kilometer esplanade. It is now being extended to allow for more (coordinated) development as the city expands. One hotel, in fact, the 360 Hotel, used a Filipino consultant, architect Yolly Reyes. It has wonderfully modern interiors (embellished in the lobby with a fantastic mural by Robby Mananquil). The city, the capital of Sarawak state, is also the jumping point for adventures into the state’s vast nature preserves, mountains, falls and coastal destinations.\nThe city museum was built in 1851 and modeled after a European town hall.\nI do have friends, too, in Kuching. Juan Lacsamana, or Johnny, is a colorful character whose wedding in Kuching I attended in the early ’90s. He married a local princess and the ceremony, which lasted into the wee hours of the next day, was a classic tale filled with cake fights (started by the best man, his brother Joel), head-banging music and wild dancing, capped by a wild chase around the city ending at the airport. But that’s another story entirely! Regardless of the adventure you’re looking for, from natural to not-the-ordinary, Kuching is truly kool!","timestamp":"2019-04-25T20:23:25Z","url":"https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/modern-living/2011/09/17/727589/truly-cool-kuching"}
{"text":"Decision trees help people identify the pros and cons of business choices.\nA decision tree is a visual tool used to help business professionals weigh the pros, cons and various approaches to major tasks or decisions. A decision tree can help executives break down the elements of a decision-making process and consider input from a range of participants. This type of approach is highly effective when used in brainstorming sessions and strategic planning meetings.\nAn individual decision tree should be used for each decision that must be made. Create the core or “trunk” for the tree using a whiteboard or large paper flipchart that is easy to write on and is visible to all participants. In the center of the core, briefly summarize the decision to be made. For example, if you are thinking about diversifying your product offerings, you would write “New product development?” in the core.\nFrom the core of your tree, draw two main “branches” or lines that represent the pros and cons of the decision. Using the example of a new product introduction, pros might include increased earnings, entry into new markets and portfolio diversification. Cons could include financial risk and the necessary investment in new machinery and employees.\nContinue to expand your decision tree by drawing potential “outcome” lines from each of your individual pros and cons. Following the same example, outcomes for increased earnings could include business stability, increased market share and the ability to expand the size of the business. Outcomes for financial risk could include business debt, job loss and company dissolution.\nThe more complex the decision to be made, the more significant and complex the decision tree can become. You may opt to continue adding different line categories that allow you to go into greater detail about the processes to be considered as part of the decision-making approach. You could include financial projections, steps to be taken during each stage of the process, timelines for implementation and allocation of staff and resources.\nWhen the decision tree is fully branched out, weigh the outcomes of the two main “pro” and “con” branches. This will help you talk through the information that is on the tree in front of you. Ideally, when the tree is complete, the group should have a firm idea of the best way to proceed. A note-taker may opt to supplement the tree with a written summary of the findings for further consideration and analysis.\nMcQuerrey, Lisa. \"Simple Example of a Decision Tree.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/simple-example-decision-tree-58613.html.

{"text":"CLEVELAND — The Cavaliers reached one magic number and lowered another.\nLeBron James scored 27 points and Cleveland entered an elite fraternity of NBA franchises with its 60th win, scoring 14 straight points in the fourth to pull away and beat the Atlanta Hawks 93-88 on Friday night.\nWith their 60th win, the Cavaliers moved within one victory — or a loss by the Los Angeles Lakers — of clinching the league's best record and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.\nCleveland (60-16) became the ninth team to post back-to-back 60-win seasons. But while that's impressive and may look nice in the record book, the Cavaliers are chasing a title they seem more prepared than ever to go after.\nMo Williams scored 24 and J.J. Hickson added 16 rebounds for the Cavs, who trailed 76-74 before James scored nine points and Williams drained a 3-pointer during Cleveland's decisive spurt.\nJosh Smith scored 20 and Jamal Crawford 17 for the Hawks, who went more than six minutes without a field goal in the fourth.\nCleveland won its 10th straight at home and improved to 34-4 this season at Quicken Loans Arena, which was at a playoff pitch throughout the game.\nThe Cavs dominated inside, but weren't able to put away the up-and-coming Hawks until their late flurry. Williams started it with a short jumper and James made a layup. After a steal, James knocked down one of his \"heat-check\" 3-pointers to make it 81-78.\nAfter another misfire by the Hawks, Williams made his 3 and James dropped a jumper to give Cleveland an 86-76 lead.\nJames then got free for a spectacular, exclamation-point dunk and was bathed with chants of \"M-V-P,\" an award he seems to have locked up with his finest season yet.\nThe Hawks, who were coming off a win at home over the Lakers, had been looking forward to this matchup.\nNot only did they want to show the Cavs and a national TV audience that the win over L.A. was no fluke, but they wanted payback from a Dec. 30 loss in Cleveland that they felt was the result of a 24-second shot-clock malfunction. The Hawks filed a protest with the league that was turned down.\nBut while Atlanta appears to have a promising future, the Hawks can't beat the present Cavs and have dropped nine straight games — including a sweep in last year's playoffs — to Cleveland.\nJames was forced to do it mostly alone in the third quarter, when the Cavs shot just 32 percent and their offense went stagnant. He was 4-of-7 from the floor while his teammates went a combined 2-of-13, allowing the Hawks to hang around and enter the fourth trailing just 69-66.\nAtlanta's defense deserved some of the credit, but the Cavs didn't do a good job of moving the ball and paid for it.\nCavs F Antawn Jamison sustained a shoulder stinger in the fourth and didn't return. … Hawks coach Mike Woodson still can't believe the Hawks' protest from the Dec. 30 loss was denied. Atlanta did not get its full allotted time after a late turnover. \"Every time I go back and look at that, it's amazing they didn't see it the other way,\" Woodson said. \"There's nothing you can do about it. We've moved on.\" … Add Jamison to the list of those opposed to seeing the NCAA tournament field expanded to 96. \"I'm old school,\" said Jamison, who made it to the Final Four with North Carolina. \"It's been working for a long time.

But officials played down those numbers, saying only three men had been reported missing.\nMore than 100 people were killed in the same area in a landslide last month, highlighting the huge risks people take to fuel global -- and particularly Chinese -- demand for jade.\nA police officer in Hpakant said rescue efforts were called off because the risk of further landslides was too great.\n\"The rescue process was stopped this afternoon because there were possible dangers and cracks appearing on the debris dump site,\" the officer, who asked not to be named, told AFP.\n\"We haven't found anybody and we don't know how many casualties there were,\" he added.\nAnother police officer had earlier told AFP three people were thought to be missing. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar Sunday reported the same figures.\nThe paper quoted Tin Swe Myint, head of the Hpakant Township Administration Office, as saying that the landslide took place after most workers had finished work and unlike last month's tragedy it had not engulfed a row of shanty houses.\nHowever a second police officer warned it was difficult to say for sure how many have been caught up in the landslide.\n\"We have no idea how many might be buried there,\" local officer Thet ZawOo told AFP by phone.\nMyanmar's shadowy and poorly regulated jade trade is enormously dangerous, with landslides a frighteningly common hazard.\nThose killed are mainly itinerant workers who scratch a living picking through the piles of waste left by large-scale industrial mining firms in hopes of stumbling across an overlooked hunk of jade that will deliver them from poverty.\nA civilian rescuer who asked not to be named said the landslide site was far from Hpakant town and had no phone coverage.\n\"There are many cracks (in the ground), it's very dangerous for rescue teams to drive diggers there,\" he said, adding that locals still believed dozens could be buried.\nMyanmar is the source of virtually all of the world's finest jadeite, a near-translucent green stone that is enormously prized in neighbouring China, where it is known as the \"stone of heaven\".\nBut while mining firms -- many linked to the junta-era military elite -- are thought to be raking in huge sums, local people complain they are shut off from the bounty.\nIn an October report advocacy group Global Witness estimated that the value of Myanmar jade produced in 2014 alone was $31 billion and said the trade might be the \"biggest natural resource heist in modern history\".","timestamp":"2019-04-21T08:59:48Z","url":"http://www.mizzima.com/news-domestic/search-ends-missing-myanmar-jade-mine-landslide-police"}

Another big draw was the premiere of rising Chinese talent Li Xiaofeng's gripping murder mystery \"Ash\".\nThe curtain officially comes down on the festival at the Busan Cinema Centre on Saturday night with the world premiere of veteran Taiwanese director Sylva Chang's generation-crossing drama \"Love Education\", and the official handing over of the awards.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T07:22:12Z","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2017/10/21/korean-iranian-dramas-share-top-prize-at-asias-leading-film-fest/"}

{"text":"10News Anchor Courtney Robinson took concerns straight to Superintendent Jeff Eakins as he met with a VPK class.\nStudents in Hillsborough County headed back into the classrooms Friday morning even though there have been serious health concerns in the schools.\nThe issues ranged from air conditioning problems, reports of lead in drinking water, gaps in radon testing and mold in at least one Hillsborough County high school.\n10News anchor Courtney Robinson took those concerns straight to Superintendent Jeff Eakins as he met with a VPK class.\nMold was found in the auditorium at Plant High School. School district officials said a faulty AC unit was to blame, and they were working to get it fixed. They said the mold was removed, the room was cleaned, and the air quality was tested. The auditorium will reopen when the air quality tests get back to them.\nAfter hearing about reports of lead in the water at schools across the country, the Hillsborough County schools started testing the water in its own facilities for the dangerous element -- and found it.\nSuperintendent Eakins said that the levels weren’t high enough to report it to families.\n“None of our buildings across Hillsborough County ever exceeded the levels by which you have to communicate out to any families that there is some sort of health issue, so we’re going to continue to test,\" he said. \"We’ve tested about 20 percent of our buildings, we had about 80 percent more to go. We’re going to ensure the safety of our students that’s Hillsborough County public schools. That’s what we do to ensure safety for our kids, and I want to make sure the public is very clear about that.\"\nAir conditioning also remains a big problem for Hillsborough schools. Officials said about 40 AC units need major repairs or to be replaced by 2021. The estimated cost for that is around $340 million.\nEakins said he thinks the schools were absolutely safe for children to be in, and issues would be found in schools across the country.\n“It’s really about ensuring the safety of our kids,\" Eakins said. \"We don’t just sit around and wait for these things to happen. That’s why we have results out there, because we do the testing we do, all those kinds of things. We’ve done it for years and we feel like that we owe that to our parents,” said Eakins.\nEakins said proper funding for the schools could help solve many of the problems the Hillsborough County School District is facing.\n►Make it easy to keep up-to-date with more stories like this.

{"text":"Four oil spill sites in Nigeria identified by the UN, which Shell has claimed to have had cleaned up by contractors since 2011, are still polluted, says a report by Amnesty.\nOne of these sites, the Bomu manifold close to the village of Kegbara Dere in Ogoniland, is Nigeria’s oil central: five major northbound Shell pipelines join four southbound ones which together carry 150,000 barrels of oil a day to the huge oil export terminal at Bonny 50 miles away. The junction is considered so important to the economy of Nigeria and Shell that it is surrounded by a high fence and guarded day and night by the military.\nBut the ageing 50-year-old pipes and rusty pumps have burst and spilt large quantities of oil at least seven times since 1990, and in 2009 a fire broke out lasting 36 hours, leading to another major spill. When UN environment programme (Unep) inspectors visited the site in 2010, they found high levels of contamination all around Bomu, pollution 5m deep in places and oil spreading into nearby cassava fields, and water supplies.\nBack in 2010, Unep inspectors said, “Nothing appears to have been done about the pollution,” and urged an immediate decontamination of the Bomu manifold along with 60 other heavily polluted sites in Ogoniland, all of which, they said, had been left untouched or only cursorily cleaned up by Shell and other oil companies since the 1970s.\nEarlier this year Amnesty International revisited the Bomu manifold three times and found the site still massively contaminated, despite claims from Shell and the Nigerian government’s watchdog pollution body that it had been cleaned up satisfactorily in 2012.\n“Water containing oil … flows along the path of the Shell pipelines. At places there are pools of oil. Some soil is black and hard. The three fish ponds, owned by a local family, are covered in a thick oily sheen, and show no signs of life. The spills … have contaminated fields and a neighbouring forest and have spread down into the Barabeedom swamp,” says Amnesty, working with the Port Harcourt-based Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD).\nThe joint report is published to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the execution of nine Ogoni leaders, including the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. Amnesty alleges that in some cases, contractors employed by Shell admit simply to burying the pollution.\n“This is just a cover up. If you just dig down a few metres you find oil. We just excavated, then shifted the soil away, then covered it all up again,” one contractor employed by Shell told Amnesty.\nThe report concerns sites at Bomu Manifold, Boobanabe, Barabeedom swamp and Okuluebu. It says: “Claims by Shell that it has cleaned up heavily polluted areas of the Niger delta are blatantly false. The only plausible explanations for why the four sites could still be polluted, four years after Unep found high levels of contamination at each of them, are that no remediation was carried out, or remediation was carried out but was ineffective, or that other spills have occurred since then.\n“In two of the four cases explanation one is ruled out by Shell itself. The company has publicly stated that the sites were cleaned up. In those two locations, explanation three [that there was subsequent re-contamination from spills after 2011] is also not possible.\n“All four sites remain visibly contaminated, even though Shell says it has cleaned them. The investigation demonstrates this is due to inadequate clean-up, and not new oil spills,” says the report.\nAmnesty says its investigators sought meetings with and wrote to both Shell and the government’s oil spill regulator, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (Nosdra), seeking an explanation.\n“Shell said they were not available for meetings. A subsequent letter from the company suggested researchers look at information on Shell’s website. But this provided little information on clean-up.\n“Nosdra is under-resourced and continues to certify areas as clean that are visibly polluted with crude oil,” says Amnesty. “The government of Nigeria is failing to fulfil its duty to protect the human rights of people living in the Niger delta. It must substantially strengthen the capacity of Nosdra to regulate Shell and the activities of Shell’s contractors,” it says.\n“By inadequately cleaning up the pollution from its pipelines and wells, Shell is leaving thousands of women, men and children exposed to contaminated land, water and air, in some cases for years or even decades,” says Amnesty researcher Mark Dummett.\n“Shell says theft is to blame for most oil spills on the Delta, but even if that were true it would not excuse the company’s historic failure to clean up oil pollution. Shell’s blame game can no longer deflect attention from its broken promises and neglected infrastructure,” says Dummett.\nShell operates around 50 oil fields and 5,000km of pipelines in the Niger delta. According to the oil giant’s own figures, there have been 1,693 oil spills leading to more than 350,000 barrels of crude oil being lost since 2007.\nShell has said it intends to clean up all the spills identified in the 2011 Unep report, but argues this could take some years.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Shell said: “Without access to the full report it is difficult to verify and respond to the detailed claims.\n“Implementation of the Unep report is part of a wider programme of remediation, pipeline protection, community engagement and social investment activities being undertaken by the SPDC JV with its government, community and civil society partners in Ogoniland.\nUnep estimated in 2011 that it could take up to 30 years and $6bn to clean up the region. The organisation made detailed recommendations to Shell and the Nigerian government.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T08:32:17Z","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/03/amnesty-report-accuses-shell-of-failing-to-clean-up-niger-delta-oil-spills"}

{"text":"Everyone went nuts for Adobe’s “content-aware fill” in Photoshop when it came out. The boring-sounding feature is in fact an incredibly useful tool, essentially an AI-powered clone stamp that intelligently brought in other pieces of the image to replace your selection. But it still failed in hilarious ways that only an AI is capable of. That should happen a lot less with the hot new tools Adobe is shipping soon.\nTeased in a sneak peek video today, the new content-aware fill has a ton of new settings that shooters will love playing with. Photographers love tweaking things — that’s just a fact — and the more things they have to tweak, the better.\n…now has a whole right-hand menu full of lovely options to choose from.\nThe most important difference is certainly the ability to choose which parts of the image the filling agent samples when it’s looking for stuff to put inside your lassoed area. If, as in the fail above, it decides to fill the field in with horse parts, you just exclude the horse from the agent’s consideration with a few brush strokes. No need to be exact — the algorithm is smart enough to work without the handful of pixels that are casualties of overeager mousing.\nThe improved algorithm also lets you tell the algo that it should be liberal with rotation and scaling of the elements it uses, or that it should mirror-image the content it finds to make it fit better.\nLastly, you can output the fill to a new layer — non-destructive editing is critical to any digital artist’s workflow. I can’t imagine why this wasn’t the case before.\nOkay, so maybe some purists will scoff at those who use such heavy-handed means to fix a shot.

{"text":"The Waste Land as an iPad app demonstrates how we might re-imagine the book, but it also illustrates how editorial choices can limit value.\nThe Guardian recently documented a June trek of 25 people through the city of London, on (TS Eliot's The Waste Land 2012 – a multimedia walk, (Henry Eliot, 30 July 2012). That a poem written in the early 20th Century remains resonant with people who live nearly a century later offers a testament to its often misunderstood and always daunting language, allusion and structure.\nBut being citizens of the 21st Century, we need not rely solely on the manuscript and printed commentary to bring the poem to us. With new devices like Apple’s iPad, the very idea of the book as a book has been reconsidered. The Waste Land, a cooperative work between Touch Press, Faber and Faber, BBC Arena and other collaborators, releases the text of the poem through the lens of the iPad. From its earliest incarnations, The Waste Land was as much a initiator of non-fiction as it was a poem. As Eliot sought to pad out his poem for book publication, he included a series of notes, which have become famous in their own right. The scholarship and commentary on the poem continues with the Touch Press treatment, which migrates much of its new insights from print to video.\nThe Waste Land app first reveals a navigation screen that offers seven content choices and a Tips screen. First is the full text of poem as published in the book from in 1922 (The poem had previously appeared in Eliot’s own journal, The Criterion, and in The Dial, without notes). The app also offers the facsimile manuscript of the poem, previously published as book.\nUnfortunately, the editors of the app, trying it appears to stay aligned with the published text, omit the first manuscript page with Eliot’s excision, leading to an incomplete context for the work and its history. They also fail to share any of the scholarship from the book, just images with short captions. The introduction and the editorial notes from the published version of the manuscript do not appear in the app. This is a first incompleteness. I will come to others later.\nThe Waste Land, like any good poem, is meant to be heard, not read. This is where multimedia offerings succeed beyond the standalone text, the random MP3 file or an LP gathering dust in a garage. Touch Stone includes five different readings of The Waste Land, two by Eliot himself. Others include Alec Guiness (Star Wars' original Obi Wan Kenobi,) Ted Hughes (British Poet Lauret and husband to poet Sylvia Plath,) Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn in Peter Jackson’s film adaptation of the The Lord of the Rings) and Fiona Shaw (Harry Potter’s Aunt in the film adaptations of J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series).\nShaw also offers a performance interpretation of the poem, complete with music and sound effects. Shaw’s performance is available as a short, standalone film, and as an audio reading that, like the other readings, follows the text as the performers read it.\nThe performances are all good, and hearing Eliot with his mid-Western-affected-proper-English continues to haunt and delight. Although the other readings offer more thoughtful emoting on behalf of the audience, Eliot's rendition provides the poet's internal rhythm and pauses, inflections and glottal stops.\nEliot's own notes, as mentioned, fueled enormous amounts of scholarship. Much of that scholarship was curated and condensed into line-by-line annotations derived taken from B.C. Southam’s excellent A Student’s Guide to the Selected Poems of T.S. Eliot. Southam’s book serves as the source for the app’s annotations. Click a line and the annotations display. These notes are fine for the casual reader, but because parts of Southam’s book, like sources (on page 31-42 of the sixth edition) aren't included, the notes ultimately prove incomplete. To do the annotations justice, Touch Press needs to include Southam’s introduction and appendix.\nAs my three bookshelves dedicated to Eliot attest, I will acquire interesting material related to Eliot, and this app counts as interesting material, especially given the lack of DVD or download access to the original BBC documentary from which its interviews were drawn (though most of the BBC Arena documentary can be found on YouTube). The commentaries are joyfully affirmative and personally insightful.\nFormer punk rocker Frank Turner draws connections to Bob Dylan and contemporary pop culture. Paul Keegan provides erudite comments on Eliot and his relationship to the poem. Jim McCue a history of publication. Craig Raine dishes haughty interpretations and observations. Fiona Shaw marvels and connects with personal anecdotes. Jeanette Winterson offers right-professorial insight. And Seamus Heaney discusses what The Waste Land means to him as a poet. Unfortunately, the entire collection of commentary fits much more with documentary film-making than with serious literary scholarship.\nI return to incompleteness here. Many important voices on Eliot don’t appear in the app beyond scattered references to particular lines in the annotations. Most notably, these missing scholars include Hugh Kenner, Frank Kermode, F.O. Matthiessen, Lyndall Gordon, Helen Gardner, George Williamson and Russell Kirk. They may not be available as video (or audio), but their text remains important. The majority of these critics and scholars might have presented Touch Stone with licensing issues, but given the partnership with Faber, Helen Gardner’s excellent tome, The Art of T.S. Eliot, would have been a good addition to the app’s content.\nMuch of the early scholarship about Eliot and The Waste Land has not yet arrived in e-reader format, though much of it is available on scholarly websites. Selections of essays or chapters would go a long way to making the app a more useful resource. Even better, given the publication and financial resources associated with Touch Press, would be a site that linked to the app, providing additional reference material on-demand.\nThe app offers some additional data in the form of a very small set of poorly integrated snapshots meant to illustrate the poem, its author, his collaborators and the publishing process. Given the visual and location-based references in the poem, more images could surely be found that could lend value to the reading. The app would benefit from the publishers going beyond the slideshow by fully integrating the images with the line readings and annotations.\nI always felt that The Waste Land prepared me for success in the Internet age. The poem that Eliot wrote and Ezra Pound helped craft fills the consciousness with fragmented jumbles of allusion and synthesis, of memory and creation, of studied eloquence and discerning observation. Blogs and other web-based content sources with their wildly far-flung links echo The Waste Land in reality, if not intent.\nOn the surface, the poem seemingly weaves together incongruities, but on deeper study it reveals a multi-layered structure. That hodgepodge of sources force the reader to engage beyond the surface, much as the Internet forces one from the page being scanned, to underlying sources or additional commentary. Before Vanevar Bush suggested a hypertext-like idea, Eliot apparently thought in hypertext-like form, recording his internal musings, broad reading, personal experience and intellectual associations into an exculpated whole.\nFor readers coming to The Waste Land for the first time, an app on an iPad with video commentary and clickable links that illuminate its language and allusions provides an appropriate entry point. For people who have studied the poem over the years, the app offers convenient access and a few new, easily consumed perspectives. I can also argue for The Waste Land app as a compelling and relatively inexpensive tool for teaching the poem, but one far from complete in its library of criticism and interpretation, and shameful in its lack of references.\nThe app is perhaps best for those who want to re-read The Waste Land and reconnect with a writer and an age now far removed from contemporary experience. As a work of art, The Waste Land continues to reveal truths 90 years after its first publication, in a new era of raging uncertainty and despair tempered by emergent potential.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T20:07:53Z","url":"https://www.popmatters.com/the-ipad-release-of-t-s-eliots-the-waste-land-is-adequate-but-could-be-better-2495809515.html"}

{"text":"Pat Maloney was a gifted experimental musician in the 1970s, until he suddenly stopped playing entirely.\nThis story starts with an ending.\nPat Maloney passed away in the late summer of 2016. He'd been facing terminal cancer, and died at home in the village of Arden, Ontario, with his wife, Joanne Pickett, by his side. Their final years together were some of their strongest.\n\"We became the best of friends,\" she said. \"We just spent such great time together. We took road trips, we talked a lot… We did all of the things that we hadn't taken the time to do before.\"\nMaloney had been a father, a friend. He was a carpenter and a conversationalist, with a sharp wit and a sense of humour. He loved reading books and watching a good hockey game.\nHe also used to play the flute — but that was a very long time ago.\nFor years, it sat in a kitchen cupboard, not so much an instrument as a relic. To his kids, the flute was evidence of a former life back in the 1970s, when Maloney worked in Toronto as a recording engineer and played in numerous bands.\n\"I'd pull it out of the cupboard and force him to play a couple of notes,\" said Luke Maloney, Pat and Joanne's son, \"But it wouldn't last more than a couple of seconds and he'd put it away. Playing music was something he was sheepish about in the time I was around.\"\nThe flute gathered dust. They never heard him use it, or make music at all. After Maloney's death, there were traces of him all over the house — woodworking materials, paperwork, half-finished projects — but it took a year for his wife to decide she was ready to climb the stairs to the attic, which Maloney had managed to fill from floor to ceiling, over the years, with boxes and tools and who knew what else.\nThat's when she found them.\nTapes. Dozens and dozens of tapes. And the old reel-to-reel machines Maloney had recorded them on.\nEverything was in pristine condition, untouched for decades. Pickett didn't know what to do with the discovery, but she had a feeling that a neighbour of hers would.\nJonas Bonnetta fronts the band Evening Hymns and runs a recording studio, called Port William Sound, on his property.\nPickett called Bonnetta, and he was like a kid in a candy store. \"When I saw the machines and the shape they were in, I was like, '…Let's use these machines to digitize all the tapes!'\" he said.\n\"I was interested in being able to give [Pickett] recordings of this person she spent a huge portion of her life with. Because I think anybody would want that.\"\nBut Bonnetta was not prepared for what he uncovered.\nWhy did Maloney give it all up, and put it away?\n\"Because he was invested in the intellectual side of music, I find it so bizarre that he would just stop making recordings,\" said Bonnetta, \"And that (his kids) don't know that Pat.\"\nHe gestured to the piles of tapes. \"I mean, what a gift, you know?\"\nSo Bonnetta decided to share what he found with Maloney's family. They all gathered in the family home in Arden, Ontario. Before he pressed play, Pickett was nervous. \"It's a little overwhelming, to tell you the truth,\" she said.\nAfter hearing some of his father's music for the first time, something clicked for Luke Maloney. \"That makes sense. He was always a rebel and that seems to be reflected in his music as well. I guess he liked to be a challenge in all aspects.\"\n\"It does kind of bring him back to life,\" Pickett said. \"I feel like I'm going to turn around and see him... it's a gift for us but it would've been a greater gift had we discovered it sooner and maybe it could've been part of his life for the last years.\"\nTo hear the documentary on Pat Maloney's lost tapes, click on Listen Now at the top of this article.

{"text":"Manifesto is silent on the dangers copyright abuses pose to Internet freedom.\nThe Campaign for Liberty, a libertarian advocacy group founded by congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul (R-TX), is gearing up for an \"Internet freedom\" project that focuses on opposing government regulation of the Internet.\nA draft of the project's manifesto was first leaked by Buzzfeed. It warns that \"collectivist special interests\" are pushing for harmful Internet legislation.\nAccording to \"Internet collectivists,\" the document says, \"'Net neutrality' means government acting as arbiter and enforcer of what it deems to be neutral.\" The document criticizes antitrust regulation of successful Internet companies and government micromanagement of everything from the electromagnetic spectrum to tech companies' privacy practices.\nIt's not surprising that a libertarian activist organization would denounce government regulation of the high-tech economy. But we were surprised to see the document denounce the \"Internet collectivist\" view that \"what is considered to be in the public domain should be greatly expanded.\"\nWe don't see anything \"collectivist\" about expanding the public domain. Due to repeated extensions by Congress, copyrighted works from the 1920s are still under copyright protection, a situation that has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Indeed, a constitutional challenge to Congress's 1998 extension of copyright terms enjoyed the support of the libertarian Cato Institute and Nobel prize-winning economists such as Milton Friedman, Ronald Coase, and James Buchanan.\nIn a Thursday interview, Campaign for Liberty spokesman Matt Hawes assured Ars that the organization did not intend to endorse today's long copyright terms. \"We think the public domain is a terrific part of the Internet,\" he told us. Rather, he said, the group was worried that \"Internet collectivists\" would use the phrase \"public domain\" as \"code for getting the government more involved\" in copyright issues.\nStill, it would be nice for the organization to take a clearer stance against Hollywood-backed copyright legislation that threatens Internet freedom. Ron Paul was an early SOPA opponent, but SOPA is hardly the only example of bad copyright legislation. For example, Congress last added 20 years to copyright terms in 1998. That means we're due for another debate on extending copyright terms between now and 2018. Opponents of that inevitable proposal could use the Campaign for Liberty's support.\nMore importantly, Congress has already enacted copyright legislation that threatens Internet freedom. Perhaps the most alarming example is the 2008 PRO-IP Act, which gives the federal government the power to seize domain names, servers, and other assets of Internet companies without proving their owners have committed any crime. Libertarians have long railed against the abuse of civil asset forfeiture laws in the war on drugs. There's even more reason to be alarmed about the government using those powers to enforce copyright laws.\nIt's important to remember that the debate over Internet freedom is not strictly a left-vs-right debate. While the left and right are never going to agree on every Internet policy issue, they've frequently found common ground when Internet freedom comes under attack.\nIn particular, we don't agree with the manifesto's claim that \"openness\" is an \"Internet collectivist\" code word for \"government control of privately owned infrastructure.\" Openness is an engineering concept that is embraced by people with a wide variety of political perspectives. There are reasonable arguments against openness being mandated by the government, but there's no reason libertarians should be hostile toward openness as such.\nProtecting Internet freedom in the future will require the same kind of ideologically diverse coalition that stopped the Stop Online Piracy Act. Branding left-of-center Internet policy advocates as \"Internet collectivists\" seems unnecessarily divisive.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T12:28:41Z","url":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/ron-paul-group-launches-campaign-against-internet-regulation/"}

{"text":"What is Mississippi State getting in new baseball coach Chris Lemonis?\nWhat is Mississippi State getting in Chris Lemonis? Let's talk about it.\nWith the news that Mississippi State has hired Indiana's Chris Lemonis to be its new baseball coach, Clarion Ledger sports editor Hugh Kellenberger and Indianapolis Star IU insider Zach Osterman had an email conversation about the hire and what it means for both schools.\nHugh Kellenberger: \"OK Zach, Indiana baseball coach Chris Lemonis is now the head coach at Mississippi State. I guess we should start with the basic, obvious question that most MSU fans are asking themselves today: Is this a good hire?\"\nZach Osterman: \"I think it is. Having grown up in SEC country (Y'all need to get more Publix in that state), I'm well aware of expectations at a place like Mississippi State. And while I know Lemonis doesn't necessarily have every resume trimming you'd want, he's a proven recruiter, a college baseball lifer and a guy who in four years at Indiana did things nobody else has done in the history of IU's oldest varsity program. His teams are balanced and deep, and in all four seasons, I covered him, the best way I could describe his style is that he brings a high floor virtually every year. Will his ceiling raise with time and the advantages of a Mississippi State? Obviously, I can't tell you that for sure. But I think there's every chance.\"\nKellenberger: \"That's I think the biggest question right now with Mississippi State: what is the ceiling? So Lemonis did a nice job taking the baton from Tracy Smith at Indiana and he had some success, including three regionals in four years. That's all very nice. But success at Mississippi State is not judged by trips to the regionals. It's super regionals and trips to Omaha. Lemonis has been to Omaha, albeit as an assistant at Louisville. So he knows what it takes to get there. But what do you think he has to do differently than he did at Indiana in order to unlock that higher ceiling? Or is it simply a matter of when you load the bus with better players, you're going to get better results?\"\nOsterman: \"I tend to think it's probably more the latter. Most casual college baseball fans (for understandable reasons) don't realize all the obstacles Big Ten programs face — weather, scheduling, recruiting base, prestige, restrictive recruiting rules. The conference has at least invested more in recent years, and loosening a few things up, but look at it this way: Since 2013, Indiana has made five NCAA regionals in six seasons, and one College World Series. Of those five regionals, the three Lemonis landed represent the program's three at-large berths ever. No Big Ten team since Ohio State in the mid-1990s has been in the tournament as often, and IU's World Series appearance (pre-Lemonis, I know) was the conference's first in 29 years. The point is, as much as IU baseball has improved — and it undoubtedly has — sustaining that level of success at a Big Ten program is a generational accomplishment. If you told me 36 wins a year would become 47 wins a year with the talent and advantages of a top-tier SEC program, I'd believe you. There are clear areas for Lemonis to improve. But he's done more here than a lot of folks probably realize.\"\nKellenberger: \"So let's talk about the recruiting because that's probably one of the biggest reasons why national baseball writers are liking this hire: Lemonis' reputation is that he's excellent at it, first at Louisville and then at Indiana. But there are two very different kinds of recruiting I think, especially in college baseball where you could have a very nice recruiting ranking that means very little when your whole class just used you as leverage with MLB teams and never show up on campus. So can you point to any players in Lemonis' past that are either A) Guys that he shouldn't have gotten in the first place but did, either because he kept them from blue bloods or the MLB Draft and B) Players that he \"discovered,\" for lack of a better word, and have developed into key contributors for Indiana.\"\nOsterman: \"Yea, this is a tougher one for me to judge, because there are so many layers to college baseball recruiting. When I say his teams always had high floors, that came first from solid recruiting. His staffs were deep, whether they had a true ace or not. His lineups never fell off after the four or five guy. IU admittedly sometimes lacked some of the star power of the Tracy Smith era (was there ever a Schwarber or a Travis or a Phegley?) but his teams were always, always deep. He also had some bad luck with committing guys early who took huge leaps late, and looked like the kinds of talents that would get drafted but then thrive in college, before they wound up going higher or getting greater slot money than anyone expected.\n\"He's still hit on a combination of good local recruiting -- many of Indiana's best players are either in state or regional, Illinois and Ohio -- and smart junior college additions to fill gaps created by unexpected attrition. Lemonis' reputation, as you said, precedes him as a recruiter. He'll emphasize local ties as much as possible. He's 100 percent the guy that will go to every tournament, watch every game, work 14-hour days. And like Dan McDonnell at Louisville, he'll happily commit a kid young (although he's not exclusive to that policy).\"\nKellenberger: \"Alright, last question: Where do you think Indiana goes from here? Mississippi State athletic director John Cohen made it quite clear he was going big-game hunting when he began his search, and it ended up with TCU's Jim Schlossnagle and Louisville's Dan McDonnell both publicly saying they were staying where they were and not going to Mississippi State. Part of Cohen's problem in the pursuit of those guys, I think, was that those guys just don't leave where they are. College baseball is a sport where coaches are much more apt to go to a place, build it up and then stay for the long-term. And now that salaries have risen to the point where generational wealth is at play, there's even less reason to jump into the unknown. So, from that perspective, MSU hiring someone who has been to Omaha as an assistant and has won a lot of games at the best school in a not-great baseball conference makes sense. And if Cohen got this right, then maybe Lemonis is that guy who stays 15-20 years. But if you're Indiana, what's your move? I would guess Fred Glass would want his own McDonnell, but that's easier said than done. Do any of the assistants have a chance at the gig? Does Glass look to the mid-majors for someone else on the rise and hope for the best?\"\nOsterman: \"That's an interesting question without a clear answer right now. Indiana is in this weird place where it's paying better than just about the rest of the Big Ten, and its facilities are really good, but it's still a clear step or two below say, Mississippi State in resources. Again, IU's having a generational level of success right now. If Glass, IU's AD, wants that to continue, he could easily justify taking that spending up another level and trying to get a home-run hire. Or he could do what Indiana's done the last two times the job came open: stick with someone young, up-and-coming and in the Midwest. Jeff Mercer at Wright State sort of straddles those two possibilities. Either way, I think Indiana will look external before considering the existing staff, and I think Glass will probably step up his financial commitment again. There's an argument to be made for IU basically just bridging the financial gap, paying high six figures (or more) for a head coach and making it harder for this to happen again. I think Glass would probably prefer this be his last baseball hire.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-23T06:04:49Z","url":"https://www.clarionledger.com/story/sports/college/mississippi-state/2018/06/25/what-mississippi-state-getting-new-baseball-coach-chris-lemonis-indiana-hoosiers-ncaa-college/730043002/"}

{"text":"Q. I have an annuity worth about $70,000. I am retired and I need the money. They say I would get $125 a month for 10 years. This isn't enough to help me. Can I break the annuity contract to get my money back?\nWithout seeing your actual annuity contract, we're going to have to be a little general here.\nWhen choosing between annuitizing and surrendering your annuity contract, there are many options to consider.\nWe're glad to see you're not jumping to make a decision without asking questions.\nAlso know that owning an annuity contract does not mean that you are locked into it forever, said Michael Green, a certified financial planner with Wechter Feldman Wealth Management in Parsippany.\nThat said, a payout of $125 per month for 10 years seems extremely low for a contract of this size, he said.\nHe said there are several types of annuity payouts available to an annuitant, and it sounds like you were provided only one option.\nSome of the payout options that could be available to you include: \"life,\" \"period certain,\" \"life with period certain\" and \"joint life and survivor.\"\nGreen explained what they all mean.\nA \"life\" payout will ensure that you will not outlive your payments.\n\"Period certain\" guarantees that you will be paid for a certain number of years, usually 10, 15, or 20.\n\"Life with period certain\" guarantees a payout for the number of years chosen for the period certain.\n\"If the annuitant dies during this period, the payments will continue for the remainder of the period certain,\" he said. \"If the annuitant lives beyond the period certain, then payouts will continue for their lifetime.\"\n\"Joint life and survivor\" will pay out the annuity over the lifetimes of two people, he said.\n\"Should you decide to annuitize, your selection of a payout option is final,\" Green said. \"Therefore, you should confirm that these payout amounts are accurately quoted before making any decisions. The more risk the insurance company takes, the lower your payout will be.\"\nIf you have considered all payout options and determined that none of them are in line with your financial goals, you may also consider liquidating your annuity to receive a lump sum distribution, Green said.\n\"It is important to keep in mind, however, that there may be additional tax consequences associated with surrendering your contract,\" he said. \"If the surrender period for your policy has already expired, you can liquidate or 'break' the annuity contract with no penalty.\"\nBut the taxation and flexibility of your withdrawal options depend on the classification of your annuity. Specifically, is the annuity qualified or non-qualified?\nGreen said a qualified annuity may be eligible for a tax deduction when purchased, but would be subject to income tax upon distribution. A non-qualified annuity is funded with after-tax dollars, and when withdrawals are taken, only the earnings are taxable.\nIn short, you have options -- but it can be easy to choose the wrong one.\nAnd, Green said, it is extremely important to know what you are getting into before signing on the dotted line.\n\"When making an irreversible decision, such as the type of annuity payout to receive, be sure to explore any potential unintended consequences,\" he said. \"For example, it is possible that you could unknowingly lose the death benefit of your policy if the wrong choice is made.\"\nHe said you should think about working with a qualified professional before making your final decision.\n\"The best option is the one that's right for you -- not the insurance company,\" Green said.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T06:50:20Z","url":"https://www.nj.com/business/2017/09/can_i_get_out_of_my_annuity_biz_brain.html"}

{"text":"A British-born sailor presumed lost at sea was not wearing a safety tether when he was knocked overboard during a yacht race, it has been revealed.\nJohn Fisher, who lived in Adelaide, Australia, plunged into the Southern Ocean, around 1,400 miles west of Cape Horn, during the Volvo Ocean Race on Monday.\nOfficials of the round-the-world race say the team searched for several hours in high wind and big waves, although deteriorating conditions forced the crew to resume course toward South America.\nFellow crew from Team Sun Hung Kai/Scallywag said Mr Fisher had unclipped his tether to tidy up a sheet when the boat was caught in an accidental crash gybe - where the mainsail and its supporting boom swing across to the opposite side of the vessel.\nAccording to a timeline of events released by the team, Mr Fisher was hit by the mainsheet system and knocked overboard. The crew believe he was already unconscious from the blow before hitting the water.\nThe 47-year-old, who was an experienced big boat sailor and was sailing in his first Volvo Ocean Race, was wearing a survival suit with a wetsuit hood and gloves and a lifejacket at the time.\nTeam manager Tim Newton described it as \"the worst situation you can imagine happening to your team\".\nHe added: \"We are absolutely heart-broken for John's family and friends. I know for David (Witt, the boat's skipper), he has lost his best friend. It's devastating.\"\nFollowing the incident, it took some time to get the boat under control and sail back to a position near where Mr Fisher had been thrown overboard.\nA search and rescue operation was carried out for several hours, but there was no sign of the sailor, and the decision was made to abandon the search as weather conditions deteriorated.\nThe crew are now making their way back to shore.\n\"This situation isn't over yet for our team,\" said Mr Newton. \"The conditions are extremely challenging, with strong winds and a forecast for a building sea state over the next couple of days.\n\"Our sole focus, with the assistance of Race Control in Alicante is to get the team into port safely.\n\"Once we have achieved that, we have time to de-brief more fully and ensure that any lessons that can be learned from what happened to John are incorporated by the rest of the fleet going forward.\n\"That would be a tremendous legacy for John, who spent so much of his time passing the learnings from his lifetime of experience at sea onto the younger sailors on our team.\"\nEarlier in the race, Scallywag crewman Alex Gough was swept overboard during a sail change and was rescued within seven minutes.\nMr Gough was not wearing a safety harness or life jacket, and skipper David Witt said at the time that he was lucky to be alive.\nIn May 2006, Dutch sailor Hans Horrevoets was swept overboard in the Atlantic Ocean. The crew turned back and found Mr Horrevoets but could not revive him.\nThis edition of the race had already been tarnished by a collision involving Vestas 11th Hour Racing and a fishing boat that killed a fisherman in January.\nThe collision off Hong Kong sank the fishing boat and caused severe damage to the racing yacht, forcing it to miss the next two legs.\nThe entire race covers some 45,000 nautical miles.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T07:06:10Z","url":"https://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/britain/british-roundtheworld-sailor-feared-dead-was-not-wearing-safety-line-team-say-36755291.html"}
{"text":"The gloves are off in the fight over the shape of Britain’s exit from the European Union.\nA showdown in Salzburg in Austria punctured the unreal bubble of collusion that had endured since the Brexit referendum in 2016.\nThe messy break-up of the European summit on Thursday revealed both sides are entering the next phase as punch-drunk protagonists swinging wildly, with no clear idea of the end point.\nTo the dismay of those who cherish international systems and institutions, it is now clear that Brexit won’t settle the argument over Europe’s future. Instead it now threatens to set up the long-range break up of the continent.\nThe Brexit argument that the overarching politics of Europe is self-interested and unbending is now unanswerable.\nPoliticians steadily losing their grasp on their own politics on Thursday rallied for the cheap thrill of knocking down the vulnerable British leader.\nEmmanuel Macron, who has alienated more French people than he has won over, lead the sneer-fest, kicking at “the liars” responsible for Brexit.\nRiding shotgun was Angela Merkel, the veteran German leader who now barely clings to the chancellor’s office. Enfeebled, she spent last week failing to sack a German domestic intelligence supremo who consorted with the far-right and rubbished her version of a race-hate protest.\nIn the end the spymaster was promoted, not ousted.\nVirtually every one of the heads of government gathered in Austria could be found wanting in this fashion.\nYet these men and women are the custodians of Europe. At the table, which was visually reminiscent of a villain's lair in a James Bond movie, the group decided to rough house Theresa May’s carefully modest proposal for a Brexit that was not horrendously disruptive.\nThe summit resembled nothing so much as a giant act of collective displacement to camouflage the real issue. This is a European culture war that is centred on immigration.\nThere is broadly a split between the most developed countries and those with less dynamic economies.\nAppropriately for the Salzburg setting, the dividing line is currently centred on the Tyrolean countries (Germany, Austria and Italy) but shifting ever further north and west.\nUnfortunately for Mrs May, the moment of clarity over the Brexit negotiations heightens her domestic difficulties. As her motorcade travelled to Downing Street on Friday, the British prime minister was frantically pulling together her response.\nOn Friday, newspaper front pages screamed “humiliation\". It felt like she was an ambush victim. A day later, the headline writers were defiantly behind Mrs May.\nFor what choice did she have but to stand firm? While the split screen showed the pound falling on the foreign exchanges, she made two clear statements of resolve. She would not offer concessions on the Irish border as the price of Brexit and she demanded serious consideration of a trade partnership that would not congeal the western European economy.\nYet the grenade-throwers who scorn a negotiated Brexit, both in Europe and in Britain, are freshly emboldened.\nThere is much pointless talk, including by some of the European leaders indulging in idle speculation, about a second referendum to keep Britain in Europe on the current terms.\nThe cavalier and dogmatic approach that Europeans have shown towards the British has alienated swathes of moderate opinion. As a result of not being listened to by the other side, the Brexit world view has a growing credibility.\nThe history of Europe is one of coming together because the collective group gave shelter from geopolitical ravages. A vision of close and neighbourly partnership is a tricky proposition when an acrimonious divorce is on the table.\nThe British must now bear the consequences of having thrown down their defences and almost all strategic advantages in the Brexit process.\nThe one certainty – that Britain would leave the EU at the end of March – must now be in doubt. Shifts will be quick and transformational. Lurking in the wings is the Marxist Labour Party.\nIt is possible that Mrs May will be unseated by a Conservative revolt when her party meets for its annual conference next week. Alternatively, she can capitulate and accept a new strategy.\nIt is possible that the complete breakdown of the talks will happen next month. It might not be possible for the two sides to even agree a temporary deal to keep ports open when Britain leaves.\nIf there is a divorce, agreeing the trade deal – which is supposed to kick in during 2020 – might never happen. Europe might just have said \"auf weidersehen\" to Britain.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T21:50:41Z","url":"https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-custodians-of-europe-were-found-wanting-during-the-breakdown-in-brexit-talks-1.772825"}

{"text":"This article was published 15/2/2011 (2991 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\nCity paramedics want locations that have been treated for bedbug infestations publicly disclosed in the same way the city publicizes restaurant health violations and city police reveal the location of indoor marijuana grow operations.\nOn Tuesday, Chris Broughton, president of Manitoba Government and General Employees Union Local 911, which represents Winnipeg paramedics, the bedbug scourge is a growing health risk to emergency personnel and the general public.\n\"You don't want to create hysteria, but there has to be a balanced public response,\" Broughton said. \"It's also a dicey subject, especially when you start getting into personal health information.\"\nBut the risk of people unknowingly spreading the bedbugs outweighs privacy concerns, he added.\n\"What we need is for people to disclose it to us,\" he said.\nHe said the city currently publicizes restaurants that have been forced to close temporarily because of insanitary conditions on a City of Winnipeg web page as a public service.\nIn the same vein, Winnipeg police use a website to disclose locations where indoor marijuana grow operations have been uncovered. Police say conditions in the house caused by the grow-ops, such as mould spores, could be injurious or dangerous to public health.\nThe same could be done with buildings that have been treated for bedbugs, Broughton said, so people are more aware of their surroundings.\nPlus, it would also give emergency workers a better idea of precautions they need to take, he said.\n\"We think government needs to take a stronger approach on these issues,\" Broughton said. \"The bedbugs are exploding in our city. No one wants to take their work home with them.\"\nHealth officials are currently putting together a province-wide response plan to deal with the bedbug invasion, Premier Greg Selinger said Monday. It will include a public awareness campaign and new ways to kill the pests.\nBroughton added there has only been a handful of instances where paramedics have spotted bedbugs on their equipment after treating a patient. That equipment and clothing had to be decontaminated before being used again.\nAlex Forrest, president of the United Fire Fighters of Winnipeg, said several firefighters have also been bitten by bedbugs during the course of their work.\n\"It's become another hazard of the job that we're being exposed,\" Forrest said. \"All you can do is educate people to minimize the risk, because it really doesn't matter where you go, a movie theatre or restaurant or hotel, you can be exposed. All it takes is one person to bring in a couple of bedbugs and increase the risk.\"\nCity police have also said they're also worried about unwittingly picking up bedbugs on calls. A handful of WPS lockers and cruiser cars have been fumigated after single bedbugs were spotted.\n\"It just boils down to what we're facing in any emergency service... you're going into a variety of different environments,\" Winnipeg Police Association president Mike Sutherland said in an earlier interview. \"These insects are relatively pernicious, and hey, they do like to travel and they spread easily.\"\nShould locations that have been treated for bedbug infestations be publicly disclosed?","timestamp":"2019-04-26T13:13:43Z","url":"https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/disclose-bedbug-sites-paramedics-116296529.html"}

{"text":"A new study by researchers at The Kinsey Institute and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has found that the timeless, multicultural tradition of grandmothering might have an unexpected benefit: helping some women temper their hot flashes and night sweats during menopause.\nThe researchers, two clinicians and a bioanthropologist, examined how close relationships can help women in midlife with this inevitable change - with the clinicians looking for therapeutic benefits that might help patients deal with this unpredictable, poorly understood transition, and the bioanthropologist predicting an evolutionary connection. Their study, which focused on the relationship between mid-life women and young children, found that women who underwent rapid menopause, caused by the surgical removal of ovaries, had fewer hot flashes and night sweats when young children lived in their homes.\nThe study was published in Menopause: the Journal of the North American Menopause Society. Study authors are Tierney Lorenz, postdoctoral fellow at The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University Bloomington, Bonnie A McGregor, researcher at University of Washington's Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Virginia J. Vitzthum, professor of anthropology and senior research scientist at The Kinsey Institute.\nThe study involved 117 participants in the study; 69 women were menopausal or postmenopausal at the time of their surgery, with 29 of them having at least one child at home, and 48 women were premenopausal, with 28 of them having at least one child at home. Researchers measured hot flashes and night sweats just before the surgery and then again at two months, six months and 12 months post-surgery.\n\"These are intriguing findings,\" Lorenz said. \"For women who were menopausal when our study began, those with young children at home actually showed more symptoms of hot flashes. But the women who underwent rapid menopause because of the surgical removal of their ovaries showed a dramatic reduction of symptoms.\"\nThe process of menopause, when ovaries no longer produce eggs and menstruation stops, varies widely. Some women have almost no bothersome symptoms, while some women experience almost crippling symptoms. Lorenz said a small subset of women experience very severe effects longer than would be expected.\nThe numerous studies on menopause have generated little consensus, Lorenz said, leaving women with a wide range of questionable treatments, such as supplements, hormonal treatments and even hot yoga. This new study is one of the first involving social interaction and menopause symptoms to control for the age of the women and also for the type of relationship - only relationships with young children were considered.\nThe study got its start with Vitzthum's interest in the evolutionary role of social structures - grandmothering in this case. The institution of grandmothering can be seen across cultures, but is it really necessary for the survival of the species? Is there an immediate benefit to the women? Is it a coincidence that women often undergo the physiological change of menopause at an age when they might have young grandchildren on hand?\nLorenz cautioned that the findings of their study cannot be generalized to all women, particularly since menopause affects women so differently. But they point to a need to examine the hormone oxytocin more carefully because of its possible role in the results. Oxytocin is associated with nurturing care and a wide range of effects across the body, including interactions involved in regulating body temperature. It also can affect mood and sleeping patterns, which can be disturbed during menopause. She also thinks it is significant that the benefits only involved young children.\n\"The fact the effects observed were limited to only women with children younger than 13 years suggests that parity was not sufficient to produce changes in flashes and points instead to the increased nurturance needs of young children,\" the authors wrote in the journal article. \"Presence of young children at home may moderate development of hot flashes during the menopausal transition.\"\nThe research was supported by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\nIndiana University. \"Having young children in the house may lessen menopausal symptoms.\" Medical News Today.

Arizona State Sun Devils defeated Utah Utes 30-10.\nA roar went up from every corner of Rice-Eccles Stadium when Tyler Huntley took the field with the Utes offense for the first time in almost a month. The noise wasn’t just palpable, it was audible.\nThen reality sunk in as Huntley’s return failed to produce a revival for the Utes’ offense. Huntley struggled so mightily that it begs the question: Did Huntley’s return do more to hurt than to help?\nHuntley, the sophomore quarterback, wowed with his playmaking ability with both his legs and his arm in the first three games of the season. The first-year starter suffered a shoulder injury against Arizona in the Pac-12 opener, and he’d been sidelined since.\nIn light of back-to-back losses, albeit by a total of four points, there seemed to be a sentiment among Utes fans that Huntley’s return would provide a necessary jolt. Some might even have argued that his presence might have changed the outcome of the previous losses.\nHuntley, facing a defense which had two interceptions in six games, completed 19 of 35 passes for 155 yards with four interceptions. His fourth interception, which came with the Utes down 23-3 in the fourth quarter, got returned 20 yards for a touchdown.\nPassing: 23 of 32, 227 yards, 1 TD, 1 Int.\nPassing: 30 of 43, 341 yards, 4 TDS, 1 Int.\nPassing: 19 of 35, 155 yards, 4 Ints.\nThe Utes’ 10 points were their fewest since scoring nine in a loss to UCLA in 2015. They managed 265 yards of total offense, and their longest play of the day was 17 yards.\nHuntley showed no obvious signs of his injury hampering him. His throwing arm did hang limply at his side for a moment immediately after getting hit on his arm in mid-throwing motion late in the first half. The next play he tossed an off-target throw up the sideline for his second interception of the first half.\nHuntley didn’t want to use his shoulder or his lack of practice time in recent weeks as excuses, and he repeatedly came back to the offensive mistakes as the reason for the poor showing.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T18:38:12Z","url":"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2017/10/22/return-of-tyler-huntley-cant-fix-utahs-offensive-woes/"}

{"text":"Stinger.next is the second large effort Hortonworks has spearheaded in order to improve the performance of Hive. The company recently completed its goals for the initial Stinger project, on which it began work in 2012 and which the company claims improved the performance of Hive by 100 times while also improving its functionality.\nThe company explains the details of how it, along with the Hadoop community, plans to pull this off in a blog post on Wednesday. It also gives a rough timeline of when the three-phase plan will be complete: ACID transactions by the end of this year; sub-second queries and Spark integration in the first half of next year; and full SQL queries along with geographically distributed queries by the end of 2015. There are a few other deliverables tied to each of those timeframes, as well.\nA successful Stinger.next initiative could be a major annoyance, to say the least, for the slew of companies that have already committed untold man-hours and financial resources building out their own SQL-on-Hadoop engines based on the premise that Hive — even running on Spark — would never be fast enough. Commercially available products include Cloudera Impala, IBM Big SQL, Pivotal Greenplum and startup Splice Machine’s eponymous database technology. Open source projects and others still under development include the Facebook-built Presto, the Salesforce.com-built Apache Phoenix and the MapR-led Apache Drill.\nThe Apache Spark community is also working on its own interactive SQL engines called Spark SQL and BlinkDB.\nThat might continue to be true, and it might be true that every technology mentioned will continue to be better than a new-and-improved Hive in one way or another. But it’s also true that a more-capable Hive is going to look very appealing to a lot of users that have been using Hive for years and don’t want to incorporate an entirely new technology (although Stinger.next does involve some major architectural changes), or that prefer their Hadoop components to be as open as possible.\nI’m not sure running SQL jobs on Hadoop is the ultimate use case for what many claim will be a revolutionary data platform, but given the size of the database market, it’s potentially a lucrative one and it’s helping highlight some big differences between each vendor’s approach to selling Hadoop.\nI would recommend updating your piece to reflect that Impala is (and has been) an open source project, freely available on github . The fact that MapR and Amazon have both adopted it and provide support for it should also be noted, to that effect. The only thing Cloudera ‘charges’ for Impala is for support.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T00:17:08Z","url":"https://gigaom.com/2014/09/03/hortonworks-lays-out-a-future-for-hive-that-includes-transactions-spark-and-sub-second-queries/"}

{"text":"Analysis: OpenMFG helps fill the void of open-source ERP applications for small and midsized businesses.\nFor the largest enterprises, access to the source code of their enterprise resource planning applications is a given. The critical nature of ERP, the desire for customization and—particularly in todays regulated environment—the need for transparency of financial systems require it.\nERP applications for small and midsize businesses dont typically offer access to source code, but thats a problem open-source applications can solve.\nDozens of open-source ERP applications are available, including derived works from common open-source projects. Better-known open-source ERP applications include Compieres Compiere, the Open For Business Projects OFBiz and ERP5 Foundations ERP5.\n/zimages/6/28571.gifClick here to read a review of ERP application OpenMFG 1.3.\nCompiere licenses its application under Netscapes Mozilla open-source license, MPL (Mozilla Public License); the Open For Business Project licenses OFBiz under the MIT Public License; and ERP5 Foundation licenses its application under the GNU GPL (General Public License).\nThe \"open\" in OpenMFGs OpenMFG refers more to open access to source code and to the fact that the product is built on open-source applications than it does to OpenMFGs being an open-source application itself.\nThe OpenMFG license protects the companys intellectual property while giving customers the option of viewing and modifying source code and making source code contributions.\nOpenMFG officials said a reseller, for example, has contributed an improvement to the applications bill-of-materials planning feature that the reseller developed for a customer.\nBy soliciting contributions while retaining control of the source code, OpenMFG can provide two important benefits for customers.\nFirst, the company adds functionality without the added third-party costs associated with more traditional commercial ERP add-on products. Second, it can ensure quality of code while providing a single source of support.\nGiven that modules are the bread and butter of ERP applications—with basic accounting spreading out to encompass supply chain, manufacturing, human resources and project management—contributions to open-source ERP applications make them more competitive with commercial offerings that generally have a broader set of modules already available.\nOpen-source applications have had success in building out functionality through module contributions and derivative work. For example, both Compiere and OFBiz have spawned derivative and complementary projects for adding other ERP functionality, such as fixed asset, HR, manufacturing and point-of-sale management.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T17:01:30Z","url":"https://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/erp-share-and-share-alike"}

Mr. Dylan, one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, was is known for his “rich and poetic lyrics” and his work had “considerable influence on the civil rights movements of the 1960s and has had significant impact on American culture over the past five decades,” the White House said.\nMr. Glenn’s selection was just a matter of time.

{"text":"University Health Network and Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network are creating a value-based health alliance that will ultimately provide statewide coverage.\nA new partnership between doctors and facilities affiliated with University of Tennessee Medical Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center aims to improve the quality of health care and reduce costs across the state.\nUniversity Health Network and Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network announced Wednesday that they are joining to create a value-based health alliance that will ultimately provide statewide coverage.\nIt will include both teaching hospitals, as well as 87 practices and more than 1,000 providers in University Health Network, plus the 13 health systems, 67 hospitals, more than 350 practices and more than 5,000 providers in the Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network. Health systems in the network span the state, from West Tennessee Healthcare to Mountain States Health Alliance in the Tri-Cities.\nThat also means UT Medical Center and University Health providers will be in-network for people covered by insurance plans accepted by Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network.\nBut its primary benefit, officials from both said, is that it sets up even more providers to collaborate with a goal of helping patients — especially those with chronic health issues — achieve better long-term health at a lesser cost.\nThe network will be a “value-based” model of delivering health care, meaning that what hospitals, doctors and other providers get paid is based on the health outcomes of their patients.\nBroadening that network means more collaboration among providers — leading, hopefully, to less duplication of costly tests and other services, since providers will be working together; better success managing chronic illnesses before they require more costly treatment or intervention; and more efficiently directing patients to primary care or preventive care, rather than having them end up in expensive emergency departments or hospital rooms in a crisis.\nStevens said the network is already seeing a decrease in cost and expects to see less use of the ER and fewer re-admissions to hospitals among patients in the network. She expects an increase in patients’ investment in their own health care — already a trend — as well.\n“I think they’re going to feel more like participants on the journey, rather than the classically paternalistic approach to health care,” she said.\nWhile decreasing costs is a goal of the network, it’s not the primary goal, said University Health Systems President and CEO Joe Landsman, who said the network should result in cost savings and better care for all patients — those covered by commercial insurance, individual policies, TennCare/Medicaid and Medicare, as well as uninsured or self-paying patients.\n“What we are trying to do is transform our delivery system, to create a better value option for those who choose to use our services,” Landsman said.\nCombining clinically integrated systems has grown in popularity in recent years, but it’s commonly limited to a single metropolitan area or a single health care system, said Dr. C. Wright Pinson, deputy CEO and chief health system officer for Vanderbilt University Medical Center and chairman of the board for Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network. What’s most unusual about this partnership is that it combines two different companies and seeks to cover the entire state, he said. That may mean using telehealth services to cover some rural areas, he said.\nLandsman and Pinson said serious discussions between the two organizations began about a year and a half ago. For now, the collaboration won’t result in new base contracts; providers will keep their current contracts, with the value-based payment layered on top of that.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T14:16:29Z","url":"https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/health/2018/09/26/vanderbilt-university-tennessee-health-network/1423634002/"}
{"text":"Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage are to go head-to-head on BBC television in a debate on Britain's future in Europe.\nThe hour-long debate will be shown on BBC2 from 7pm on Wednesday, 2 April, and will be hosted by David Dimbleby.\nMr Clegg's Liberal Democrats are the most pro-EU of the main parties at Westminster, while Mr Farage's UKIP advocates withdrawing from the EU.\nThey have been involved in a growing spat over the issue, ahead of May's European elections.\nLast month, Mr Farage accepted Mr Clegg's invitation to a televised \"open debate\" on whether the UK should stay in the EU.\nThe BBC said the televised debate would take place in front of an audience \"selected by a reputable polling organisation to be demographically representative and with an equal number of people for and against British membership of the EU\". Questions will come from the audience members.\nJames Harding, Director of BBC News and Current Affairs, said: \"We are delighted to have negotiated successfully to broadcast this important debate. Europe is always a highly charged issue in British politics and this is a fantastic opportunity to test the arguments.\"\nMr Clegg last month challenged the UKIP leader to a debate on his weekly phone-in programme on LBC radio, which will also host a clash between the two party leaders.\nHe said: \"I will challenge Nigel Farage to a public, open debate about whether we should be in or out of the EU, because that is now the choice facing this country and he is the leader of the party of 'out'; I am the leader of the party of 'in'.\n\"I think it's time we now have a proper, public debate so that the public can listen to the two sides of the argument and judge from themselves.\"\nIn response, Mr Farage said he wanted the Conservative and Labour leaders to join in a four-man debate, which he suggested should take place during the European election campaign in April or May.\nBut he said he would take on the Lib Dem leader in a head-to-head debate even if the other party leaders declined.\nDowning Street said David Cameron will not be taking part in the debate with Mr Farage and Mr Clegg.\nA spokesman said the prime minister would be setting out his views on Europe during the European election campaign and did not want to start \"another process\", adding the Lib Dems were \"a bit needy of publicity\".\nThe Labour Party said the party's priority was to reach agreement on TV debates between the two prospective prime ministers ahead of the next election.\n\"Anything else will be a matter for negotiation after that is agreed,\" he added.\nLeaders debates have long been a feature of election campaigns in the United States, but took place for the first time in Britain at the 2010 general election.\nBut there is some doubt over whether the exercise will be repeated in 2015, amid behind-the-scenes wrangling over the likely format and timing of the programmes and battles about who should be allowed to take part.\nThe BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the debate between Mr Clegg and Mr Farage could encourage the party leaders to sign up to general election debates or, alternatively, \"provide some room to argue against them\".\nUKIP is consistently ahead of the Lib Dems in national opinion polls, with Mr Farage claiming his party is in with a chance of topping the polls at the European elections.\nThe Liberal Democrat party president Tim Farron, by contrast, is warning his party it faces the \"fight of their lives\" to retain its 12 MEPs.\nMr Clegg, who has known Mr Farage since his days as an MEP, between 1999 and 2004, has opted to launch an all out attack on his Eurosceptic rivals, focusing on their voting record in Brussels and Strasbourg.\nIn a speech on the EU's role to the Centre for European Reform, Mr Clegg accused Mr Farage and his colleagues of failing to \"stand up for Britain\" in the European Parliament.\n\"Nigel Farage and deputy leader Paul Nuttall rarely turn up to vote in the European Parliament, despite being happy to take their taxpayer-funded salaries,\" he said.\n\"UKIP MEPs refuse to roll up their sleeves and get down to work. Nigel Farage hasn't tabled a single amendment to EU legislation since July 2009.\"\nMr Farage hit back at his rival's claims, saying: \"Nick Clegg has some cheek raising attendance and voting records. Although Nick Clegg lives in London, between 2010 and 2014 he has voted in Westminster only 22.6% of the time.\n\"By contrast I live eight hours away from Strasbourg, lead a national party and have voted 55% of the time in the European Parliament.\"\nHe also said that the group of MEPs that he leads, the \"Europe of Freedom and Democracy\", had \"put down hundreds of amendments since 2009, so factually Nick Clegg is quite wrong in what he's saying here\".\nHe said he would use the TV debate with Mr Clegg as a \"platform for the majority of British people who want our relationship with Europe to be one of trade and co-operation but not one of political union\".","timestamp":"2019-04-22T16:17:45Z","url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26443312"}
{"text":"Randy Johnson could be in pinstripes by this time next week.\nDespite a stumbling block yesterday and a few hurdles that still need to be cleared, an industry source said last night the complicated multi-team trade that would put The Big Unit in The Bronx has been agreed to in principle. Soon enough, Johnson, the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, should be headlining the Yankees’ rotation.\nThe deal is a bit tricky but essentially works like this: Los Angeles will send right-hander Brad Penny, outfielder Shawn Green, reliever Yhency Brazoban and a minor league pitcher to Arizona. Arizona will then send Johnson and another minor league pitcher to the Dodgers. The Yankees will then send righty Javier Vazquez and two minor league prospects (catcher Dioner Navarro and third baseman Eric Duncan) to the Dodgers.\nFinally, the Dodgers will ship Johnson and probably left-hander Kaz Ishii to the Yankees to complete the deal. Got all that?\nSo, if you’re keeping score of who goes where, the Yankees add Johnson and likely Ishii; the Diamondbacks get Penny, Green, Brazoban and a minor league pitcher; and the Dodgers acquire Vazquez, Navarro, Duncan and another minor league pitcher. Additionally, if the Yankees get Ishii, they will pay $2 million of the $5 million remaining on his contract.\nThere are still a few issues that need resolution. One, there is a lot of deferred money with several players that needs to be ironed out. Two, several of the key players – Johnson and Penny, in particular – have to undergo and pass physicals. And three, multiple no-trade clauses – with Johnson and Green – have to be figured out.\nFinally, the deal has to go to commissioner Bud Selig to be approved. Once Selig approves it, likely on Monday, then a 72-hour window will open for the Yankees to talk to Johnson and the Diamondbacks to talk to Green about extensions. Both players have no-trade clauses and have only one year remaining on their contracts.\nIt will take at least a week to get everything all cleared up. Still, even Penny himself told ESPN Radio yesterday the deal is nearing completion, and he’s on track to have a physical with the Diamondbacks next week.\nAt one point yesterday, the Yankees believed there could be a fourth team involved in the trade, possibly either Baltimore, St. Louis or the White Sox. But now it’s believed there is no fourth team needed, unless the Dodgers want to move Vazquez in another deal.\nBarring something unforeseen, the trade should eventually be completed. Once it is, it will allow the Yankees to go from having a shaky rotation to sporting arguably the best five-man unit in the game – Johnson, Mike Mussina, Carl Pavano, Jaret Wright and Kevin Brown (if he is not traded). They would also likely have Ishii as insurance, a lefty who went 13-8 with a 4.71 ERA this past year.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T09:41:09Z","url":"https://nypost.com/2004/12/18/unit-getting-closer/"}
{"text":"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Treasury prices extended their pullback Tuesday, propelling the government debt market to its fourth day of losses in five sessions, after data showed service-sector companies expanded at a faster rate in October.\nThe Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing survey of purchasing manufacturers rose to a 55.4% reading last month from 54.4% in September, beating economist expectations of a 54% reading. A result over 50% indicates expansion.\nThe 10-year note US:10_YEAR yield rose 5.5 basis points on the day to 2.660%, up roughly 15 basis points from last week to its highest level since mid-October. The 30-year bond US:30_YEAR yield rose 5.5 basis points to 3.753%, while the 5-year note US:5_YEAR yield rose 2 basis points to 1.380%.\n“When we saw the ISM manufacturing [on Friday] and nonmanufacturing both being stronger than expectations and better than the previous, it really called into question the thesis that the government shutdown shook confidence,” said Tom Graff, fixed-income portfolio manager at Brown Advisory.\nTreasurys have given up some gains that followed a Federal Reserve decision not to scale back its bond-buying program in September as the market continues to seek clarity on a time frame for when the central bank will begin to edge out of its $85 billion in monthly purchases. Though many had homed in on expectations of a pullback in the spring of 2014, some market participants have moved forward their expectations for timing and speed after the Federal Reserve’s policy statement last week sounded a less dovish tone than expected.\n“I think the expectation was for something overly dovish, and I think it came out in the middle-of-the-road,” said Boris Rjavinski, rates and rate derivatives strategist at UBS.\nAs investors look for clarity about how the Fed may edge out of its monthly bond buys, it will look to an October nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which the central bank uses as an assessment of the labor market. The data, however, may be skewed by the federal government shutdown last month.\nHome prices rose in September rose at the fastest annual pace since early 2006. According to data released by CoreLogic Tuesday, home prices rose 0.2% in September as the annual pace hit 12%.\nFed speakers in recent days have taken to the podium to give their outlooks on monetary policy. Despite a range of opinions, some central bankers seem to have become less dovish in their appearances, perhaps in an attempt to help guide the markets, according to Rjavinski.\n“I think if you try to parse the Fed-speak lately, what you may seen is that they’ve gotten more careful about how they communicate their intentions to the market,” he said.\nEric Rosengren, the president of the Boston Fed Bank, said Tuesday that economic growth in the second half of the year is shaping up to be “substantially slower than I want to see.” Rosengren, who is a voting member of the policy committee this year, said late Monday that delaying the so-called taper of the Fed’s bond-purchase program would not substantially alter the Fed’s balance sheet.\nRichmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker spoke in the afternoon but didn’t touch on monetary policy.

{"text":"Sam’s Outdoor Outfitters and 48 apartments are located inside The Barber Building in Brattleboro, which has been sold to a New York real estate firm for $2.4 million.\nBRATTLEBORO—New York-based real estate firm Time Equities Inc. (TEI) in April purchased the two buildings that house Sam’s Outdoor Outfitters, Sam’s Too, and 48 apartments.\nBrad Borofsky said his family’s business, Sam’s, will remain open and operating. The business has signed a long-term lease with TEI, he said.\n“We have no plans of leaving any time soon,” Borofsky said in the midst of writing inventory orders for next spring and summer.\n“We’ll be here longer if the sales environment can stay healthy enough to sustain us,” he added.\nThe Barber Building — 62-74 Main Street — and 9 Flat Street mark TEI’s first acquisition in Vermont.\nAccording to the real estate firm’s news release, the majority of the company’s holdings are in the Northeast. The company has properties in 27 states, five Canadian provinces, Germany, the Netherlands, and Anguilla, in the British Virgin Islands.\nSelling the two buildings provided a good business opportunity, Borofsky said. Borofsky’s grandfather Sam started the business in 1932.\n“We didn’t have to sell the building,” Borofsky said.\nAccording to Borofsky, Sam’s three stores — in Brattleboro, Keene, New Hampshire, and Hadley, Massachusetts — are strong and healthy.\nHe added, however, that now is a good time to sell. He said Brattleboro “looks good” between the Brattleboro Food Co-op’s new building, wonderful restaurants, the renovated Brooks House, and post-Tropical Storm Irene repairs.\nBorofsky highlighted the changes he has witnessed in Brattleboro during his family’s tenure at the corner of Main and Flat streets.\nHe listed a host of stores that used to call Brattleboro home, such as Mann’s, Woolworth’s, and King’s.\nThere was a time when Keene residents shopped in Brattleboro, he said.\nMost outdoor-focused bricks-and-mortar stores are struggling as more people shop on the internet, he said. For Brattleboro, one of the biggest competitors is Keene, NH.\nIn Borofsky’s view, Keene is the region’s hub town. It has a variety of stores and amenities and no sales tax, he said. Vermont doesn’t charge sales tax on clothing and footwear, but most people don’t know that, he added.\nBorofsky thanked the local residents who shopped at Sam’s. The store also has a steady tourist base — although Mother Nature dictates those tourist sales quite a bit, he said.\nAccording to public documents, after approximately one year on the market, the two buildings were purchased by TEI for $2.4 million. Ranger Curran of RE/MAX Town & Country brokered the deal on behalf of Borofsky.\nBorofsky said most of the sale price will go toward paying off debt and toward capital gains taxes.\nTogether, the two buildings total approximately 64,617 square feet.\nAccording to the news release, the company owns and maintains approximately 22.61 million square feet of residential, industrial, office and retail property. This portfolio includes more than 3,078 multi-family apartment units.\nThe company has an additional approximately 1.62 million square feet of properties in various stages of development.\nMax Pastor, Associate Director of Acquisitions at TEI, noted in the news release that the Sam’s buildings offer an opportunity to “become more active in the state of Vermont and surrounding areas.” The buildings also provide “a strong cash flow” and other opportunities.\n“Boasting a diverse population, independent stores and restaurants, educational and healthcare services, cultural institutions and an ideal location near the Connecticut River, we are optimistic about the investment potential of Brattleboro and look forward to evaluating future transactions in Vermont,” Pastor said.\nIn an email, Pastor said the company has searched for properties in Vermont for some time.\nWhile the buildings’ sale marks a transition of the Borofsky family, it also could mark a change for the rental market.\nThe Barber Building on Main Street houses 48 apartment units, which range from efficiencies (one room) to four-room apartments.\nAccording to the Barber Realty website, which lists apartments’ details, rents range from $650 for a one-room apartment to $950 for a four-room apartment. Rents include utilities. All are within walking distance to most services.\nA spin through websites that list rentals like craigslist.com or apartments.com turned up a range of rents. Only a handful of the offerings included all utilities.\nRents on efficiencies ranged from $595 to $850. Rents on one-bedroom apartments ranged from $650 to $1,000, with the majority of the rents in the $700 range. Two-bedroom apartments were listed at $775 to $1,800, with most in the $1,000 range. Finally, the few three-bedrooms ranged from $980 to $1,495.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lists the fair market rent for Windham County as $750, including utilities, for a one-bedroom apartment.\nChristine Hart, executive director of the Brattleboro Housing Partnerships, said people with Section 8 vouchers are looking in the $750 price range. And that rate is low for the Brattleboro market, she added.\nShe has noticed that people searching for apartments through the Partnership’s voucher programs are taking longer to find them, generally between 30 and 90 days. Hart said she receives lists of where apartment hunters have contacted and that, at least judging by the length of the lists, people are really looking.\n“Apartments are tight at that market level,” she said.\nOriginally published in The Commons issue #364 (Wednesday, July 6, 2016).

{"text":"A Sino-American summit that would discuss American arms sales to Taiwan and other issues including global strategy seems a possibility following Vice-Chairman Deng Xiaoping's expression of interest in meeting President Reagan.\nMr. Deng, China's de facto leader, raised the possibility during a meeting with visiting United States Sen. Howard Baker. As Senate majority leader, Mr. Baker works closely with President Reagan.\nSenator Baker told a press conference here June 2 that he had been ''especially pleased to hear Vice-Chairman Deng say he would like to meet with President Reagan, and indeed he asked me to convey this message to President Reagan. . . .'' He said the details were not for him to arrange but for the President and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.\nThe atmosphere of Sino-American relations has improved following Vice-President George Bush's visit to China early last month. But the difficult problem of American arms sales to Taiwan still ''ticks'' away, in Chinese words, like a ''time bomb.'' Hitherto it had been assumed that President Reagan would not visit China until the arms sales issue has been disposed of.\nNow it appears that Mr. Deng, whose formal position is vice-chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (Mr. Deng's protege Hu Yaobang is chairman) would welcome a chance to talk directly to President Reagan about the Taiwan question and other issues.\nSenator Baker said he also raised the case of the detention of Lisa Wichser, an American graduate student employed by the Chinese government as a teacher of English in Peking, with Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Wenjin June 1. Miss Wichser, who is working for a PhD in agricultural economics from the University of Denver, has been accused of having violated Chinese laws and of ''activities incompatible with her status,'' according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman here.\nMr. Baker said he did not know all the details of the case but that he had been assured by the Chinese that they would strictly follow the terms of the Sino-American consular convention. He hoped Miss Wichser would be allowed to leave China as soon as possible.\nChina wants an American commitment to reduce and ultimately stop Taiwan arms sales altogether. It argues that continued sales violate China's sovereignty.\nPresident Reagan, who campaigned for office saying he would upgrade relations with Taiwan and give the islanders more and better weapons, has gradually changed his position. He now takes greater account of the importance of the strategic relationship between China and the United States in facing the Soviet Union. Since taking office he has restricted arms sales to Taiwan to $60 million worth of spare parts.\nBut he remains constrained by the Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress in April l979 following normalization of relations between Washington and Peking. This act provides for the US to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons for self-defense.\nDoes the act give the President the latitude to sell or not sell arms to Taiwan, or to cease arms sales altogether? Senator Baker seemed to think that the act as written leaves implementation in the hands of the president with the consent of Congress. Thus there is no need to amend the act, as amendment would also be politically extremely difficult.\nHowever, in his conversation with Mr. Baker June 1 Mr. Deng apparently raised for the first time the possibility of amending the act. Mr. Baker told him he would convey Mr. Deng's remarks not only to the President and to Mr. Haig but also to his senatorial colleagues. However Mr. Baker said he himself did not favor an amendment of the act.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T19:03:12Z","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0603/060354.html"}

Unfortunately, it was the type that hasn't been overly common for him yet this season, as even the stellar showing versus Milwaukee only served to raise his average to .226. Matters may be looking up, however, as Goldschmidt is now 5-for-12 with a double and Monday's homer over the last three games.\nGoldschmidt went 1-for-4 with a home run and two runs scored Tuesday against the Dodgers.\nGoldschmidt took Ross Stripling deep in the fifth inning for his sixth home run of the season.

{"text":"Editor’s note: Ashley Johnson is now the media contact for the Tent City Collective. She started the article prior to accepting the role.\nWhen I moved to Seattle this past summer to start my journey in the Communication Leadership program, I was excited to explore the Emerald City and discover all of its hidden gems. After some doing typical touristy things (thanks Buzzfeed!), I asked a few friends and coworkers for a some “local” suggestions. Instead of recommending fun, trendy, night spots, many chose to offer warnings — they told me to stay safe and avoid “the homeless,” especially those living in tent cities.\nA woman who lost her home of several decades due to an increase in mortgage payments poses for photo. She lives Tent City 3 because she and her family did not meet the requirements for area shelters. Photo by Ashley Myrriah Johnson.\nI’m from a small suburb in the mid-Atlantic states, and the concept of “tent cities” was unfamiliar and foreign. Even though I had spent years advocating for impoverished communities back East, I was not familiar this term used to describe a subset of the population experiencing homelessness. So, I did what any curious millennial would do; searched “tent cities Seattle” on Google and started researching the topic.\nOne search result detailed Ballard residents‘ adverse reaction to a temporary housing encampment to their neighborhood. It reinforced the notion that there is a disconnect between the stable housing community and those living in man-made transitional camps. So when Comm Lead Associate Director Anita V. Crofts challenged Cohort 15 to find a novel and useful solution to a communication challenge in our community, I jumped at the idea of using communication techniques to address the widespread stigma towards homeless people living in housing encampments.\nBut, how does one find a way of destigmatizing homelessness and tent cities that has not already been attempted?\nWhile there are dozens of organizations in Seattle that advocate for homelessness through creative storytelling — not to mention many of media outlets covering the issue from a variety of angles — there are few organizations and people who have undertaken the challenge of advocating on behalf of entire communities suffering from the loss of stable housing.\nReal Change News is based in Seattle and covers homelessness and social justice issues in the city.\nBurkhalter has written about temporary homeless encampments in King County, and noted the importance of interviewing the members of the population experiencing homelessness. It’s one way to accurately represent the many identities and stories that comprise the community. In advocacy, it is important to have a wide set of terms that describe the issue at hand. Without accurate and culturally representative terminology, stories become homogeneous and repetitive.\nPhoto of a Tent City 3 dormitory for newly-arrived single men. Photo by Ashley Myrriah Johnson.\nIn my research to better understand the multifaceted landscape of homelessness in Seattle, I met a group known as The Tent City Collective (TCC). I was struck by their community-focused approach to homelessness. TCC is a team of University of Washington students, alumni, Tent City 3 residents (TC3), and community members who work together to involve the university in ongoing conversations about homelessness. The group ultimately hopes to bring TC3, which is currently located just north of UW at University Congregational United Church of Christ, to campus. Group members believe conversations concerning people experiencing homelessness must include homeless people themselves.\n“If we are working with a stigmatized group and are not experiencing the same oppressions as their community members, there are many, many nuances about their lives that we will be ignorant to,” said lead organizer Hana Alicic.\nBy including the TC3 community members in their advocacy efforts, the TCC advocates for temporary housing encampments on multiple fronts. They hope UW community stakeholders will build relationships TC3 residents and learn how the stigmatization of people experiencing homelessness results in systematic discrimination against people unable to find stable housing.\nAn area with food and supplies in TC3. Photo by Ashley Myrriah Johnson.\nEveryone living in Seattle, unsheltered and sheltered alike, is a Seattleite.\nBoth approaches to the destigmatization of homelessness centered around one common train of thought: creating empathy for one’s neighbor. Recognizing that people fear and stigmatize what they do not understand, Real Change News and Tent City Collective challenge the societal consequences of stigmatization of homelessness through representative storytelling to bridge a communication gap within Seattle.\nBecause at the end of the day, everyone living in Seattle, unsheltered and sheltered alike, is a Seattleite.\nAshley Myrriah is earning her Master's of Communication in Digital Media.\nAshley, great job taking the reader along with you on your journey to learn about this.

{"text":"Despite being a rookie, Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey has already gained enough experience and insight to know there’s a difference between marking Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown and Cleveland Browns wideout Josh Gordon.\nElite might seem a bit of stretch for a player who has played in only two games since being reinstated after an NFL-imposed suspension that began after Week 16 of the 2014 season. After all, Gordon is 92 receptions, 1,355 yards and eight touchdowns behind Brown, a five-time Pro Bowl selection this season.\nDespite missing two straight practices because of an injured right ankle, Ravens wide receiver Mike Wallace said Thursday he would practice Friday and play in Sunday’s game at the Cleveland Browns.\nBut Gordon, 6 feet 3, 225 pounds, is a unique blend of speed and power. After catching four passes for 85 yards in his 2017 debut against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 3, he had three receptions for 69 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown with 4:45 left in the first quarter, in a 27-21 overtime loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. It was Gordon’s first trip to the end zone since Dec. 15, 2013, a span of 1,456 days.\nRavens coach John Harbaugh called Gordon “a big-play threat, a big, rangy receiver that can go up and make plays on the ball.” But Harbaugh stopped short of declaring that the defense would bracket Gordon as some fans wished the unit would have done against Brown, who gained a season-high 213 yards on 11 receptions Sunday.\nHow long Gordon, 26, can avoid being suspended again by the league for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy remains to be seen.

{"text":"What the Hell Is Happening in Iran?\nIranian students protest at the University of Tehran during a demonstration driven by anger over economic problems. Students were outnumbered by counterdemonstrators, however, as videos on social media showed.\nAnti-government protests continued across multiple cities in Iran for a fourth day on Sunday, the most widespread unrest in the country since the pro-democracy Green Movement in 2009 — though nowhere near the same scale thus far. Two protesters were killed overnight Saturday, the first deaths attributed to the unrest. On Sunday, authorities reportedly blocked Instagram and the popular messaging app Telegram, which Iranians have been using to spread news about the protests. The country’s powerful Revolutionary Guard has threatened a violent crackdown if the demonstrations continue.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani, in remarks which were aired on state television on Sunday night, supported Iranians’ right to protest and criticize the government, and indicated that some of the protesters had legitimate demands but that protests should not include violence or anti-regime slogans.\nThe unrest began with a protest in Iran’s second-largest city, Mashhad, on Thursday, apparently led by hard-liners who wanted to voice their opposition to the reformist policies of President Rouhani. Protests don’t always go as planned in Iran, however, since people sometimes take advantage of the rare opportunity to express dissent publicly, regardless of the original organizers’ intentions. That seems to be what happened in Mashhad, as an anti-Rouhani protest morphed into a broader anti-regime one, decrying rising prices, corruption, and Iran’s foreign-policy expenditures in places like Syria and Lebanon.\nThe protests, publicized on the popular messaging app Telegram and subsequently reported on by foreign-based satellite news networks, then quickly spread to other cities across the country on Friday, including Tehran, other major cities, and a surprising number of smaller cities that don’t typically see such demonstrations. As the protests spread, many took on an even harsher anti-regime tone, with slogans calling for the downfall of the country’s supreme leader and Islamic government. The seemingly spontaneous, often provincial, protests varied in size, with some resulting in violent clashes with police. Scores have reportedly been arrested throughout the country.\nThe apparently leaderless protests continued on Saturday, despite the government’s warning against participating in “illegal gatherings.” Violence was reported at rallies in several cities as police and plainclothes security officers continued to try to suppress the unrest. Two protesters were killed by gunfire in the western city of Dorud, but local officials denied that security forces were responsible for the deaths, characteristically blaming Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign powers instead.\nAlso on Saturday, pro-government protesters took to the streets in Tehran and other cities to participate in a preplanned celebration of the anniversary of the crackdown on the Green Movement. So far, there has not been a similar crackdown in response to this new outbreak, but that could change fast. One of the leaders of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard told state media on Saturday that protesters would face “the nation’s iron fist” if the unrest continued, and internet access to Instagram and Telegram were blocked on Sunday in an attempt to cut off information about the protests.\nOther reports indicate that the internet was also throttled in Tehran and cut off entirely in Mashhad.\nAs The Guardian and New York Times point out, small protests focused on economic issues are normal in Iran, but politically charged protests across the country where people feel safe chanting “death to the dictator” — a knock on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei — are not. The protests will undoubtedly be an important test for the relatively moderate Rouhani, who has not been spared as a subject of chanting at the rallies; in his remarks on Sunday, Rouhani was clearly trying to walk a delicate line. There is also apparently suspicion among members of his administration and other reformers about what forces may be behind the unrest.\nSome experts aren’t surprised at the sudden wave of protests, however, noting the economic discontent created by the ongoing rise of the cost of living and the unemployment rate in the country.\nThe Trump administration, which has sought to undo President Obama’s diplomatic progress with Iran and has even flirted with fantasies of promoting regime change, criticized Iran’s government on Friday and urged it to allow the protests to continue. Calling for restraint against peaceful protests is the standard response to unrest in Iran from any administration, though this White House has added some Trumpian flare.\nPresident Trump then revisited the subject in more tweets on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, but such support is probably more useful to the regime than it ever is to protesters, particularly since Trump has already made it easier for the regime to use the U.S. as a scapegoat for its internal problems by threatening to cancel the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions. Indeed, nothing Trump has done since taking office has indicated he or his administration has any real concern for the citizens of Iran.\nRegarding what will happen next in Iran, most experts aren’t sure, especially since this new movement, if that’s what it is, does not appear to have any leaders to guide it. As The Wall Street Journal’s Farnaz Fassihi points out, the lack of leadership, structure, and goals is exactly why previous uprisings have typically failed.\nThe Iranian government, as it has in the past, is working to block social-media platforms used by protesters, but there are still more ways than ever before for reports and videos about the protests — as well as any subsequent crackdown — to spread. In addition, if the regime cuts off or drastically slows down internet access as it did in 2009, that would likely have a much more dramatic effect on the country’s businesses and citizens now that the internet is more widely used and relied upon.\nThere has also been some tentative support for the protests from hard-liners, who seem to want the unrest to tarnish Rouhani, and that has caused some Iranians to worry the protests are being encouraged as a regime plot to draw out and capture opposition activists. Many anti-regime protesters faced long and brutal imprisonment after being arrested during the Green Movement, and a few hundred may have been killed.\nAs always, regime-change cheerleaders in the West should probably temper their expectations and refrain from projecting their views onto the protesters. But if the unrest continues, spreads, and increases in size — possibly prompting a violent crackdown by regime security forces — it could quickly lead to a new political crisis in the country at a time when it already faces a resurgent regional rival in Saudi Arabia and a U.S. administration that seems reflexively anti-Iran.\nIs it a revolution? Not yet. Iran’s government is its own worst enemy and the Iranian people know it. Economic woes leading to infighting can bring down this corrupt and brutal system. Different factions within the government will, most probably, and just the same as always, choose to dismiss the genuine economic grievances of the Iranian people and blame the protests on foreign agents and an international imperialist-Zionist conspiracy.\nThe Iranian people have learned, after living almost 40 years under the Islamic Republic, to gradually and intelligently raise their voices in peaceful protests that will provoke the government to tear itself apart. Iran’s rulers may choose to blame foreigners and Zionists — but they hardly realize that the true danger to their power is right at home.\nAlong similar lines, NIAC research director Reza Marashi, who worked in the Office of Iranian Affairs for the State Department under the Obama administration, adds that the current political climate in Iran does not appear conducive to massive change, but that the gap between state and society will remain — making protest waves like the present one possible — so long as the political, economic, and social aspirations of the Iranian people remain unmet.\nThis post has been updated throughout to reflect new developments and commentary.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T16:41:41Z","url":"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/what-the-hell-is-happening-in-iran.html?gtm=bottom&gtm=bottom"}

{"text":"The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 was enacted to protect employees who need to take absences from work to care for themselves or their family members due to medical problems. This law was amended in 2008 to allow extended leave for the care of service members. Retaliation of any type is strictly prohibited. Employers who use FMLA absences to judge an employee's performance face legal sanction from the Department of Labor or in civil court.\nNot all leave falls under the auspices of the FMLA, even if that leave is taken for medical reasons. If the business is governed by the provisions of the FMLA, the employee must have worked for the company for at least 12 months and have completed 1,250 hours of work within the previous 12 months to be considered eligible for leave. Leave may be granted to allow employees to care for themselves, their spouse, their children or their parents. Other family relationships are not covered by this legislation. Leave is considered unpaid and may be requested for up to 12 weeks per year. Military family members are eligible for 26 weeks of leave annually.\nWhile an employee is away from work under the FMLA, his position with the company is secure. An employer may not eliminate his position in the company, but the exact job he held may not be available at the time of his return. For example, a customer service representative who works in a certain store may return to work to find that he now works in a different department or in a different store. It is at the employer's discretion to shift personnel as needed as long as the employee in question returns to work with the same job or a job comparable to the job he was doing when he went on leave.\nDuring the leave, an employer may not cancel the benefits an employee is receiving. This includes any health, dental, life or supplemental insurance policies; retirement programs; or employee assistance programs. Employees are responsible for paying any premiums that may be due during their leave to ensure no lapses occur. Failure to make arrangements for payments may result in the termination of coverage through no fault of the employer.\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act is governed by the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Any complaints, questions or concerns that cannot be resolved through the employer should be directed to the nearest state office. Employees may seek legal action if they feel the employer has violated FMLA by downgrading them on a performance evaluation because of an eligible absence.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T11:10:59Z","url":"https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/can-fmla-absences-affect-performance-evaluations-9476.html"}
{"text":"The statue of Robert the Bruce at The Battle of Bannockburn Centre. PIC: Michael Gillen/Falkirk Herald.\nThere is possibly no other figure in Scottish history greater worshipped than Robert the Bruce.\nHe led the Scots to victory over the English at Bannockburn in 1314, with the win immortalised in the anthem Flower of Scotland, and secured recognition from Rome as the King of an independent Scotland.\nBut Bruce was also murderous and sly who cleared his path to power without mercy, some say.\nRobert was born on July 11, 1274 and raised at Turnberry Castle in Ayrshire.\nHe was distantly related to the Scottish royal family with his grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, one of the leading contenders to the throne left empty by the death of Margaret of Norway.\nThis bid for Bruce rule was rejected in favour of the rival rights of John Balliol in 1292 but the family’s royal aspirations remained.\nThe Bruce family held land across the south west of Scotland and England, with Robert the Bruce, as Earl of Carrick, working to protect his territories across two warring kingdoms.\nAs a result, he led resistance against Edward I, who ruled Scotland as a province of England, and later submitted to the King in order to protect his family’s interests.\nHe raids Lanarkshire with the English in 1297, before joining William Wallace’s uprising and then surrendering to the English King at Irvine, according to accounts.\nAfter being pardoned for his treachery, Bruce is back with the King in Galloway in 1298 but by the next year he is attacking his castle at Lochmaben near Annandale.\nFollowing the defeat of William Wallace at Falkirk in 1298, Bruce and John Comyn succeed the guardianship of Scotland.\nThe 1306 murder of Comyn - whose body was found following a meeting with Bruce at a church in Dumfries - has been described as the greatest political murders of all time.\nThe meeting started quietly by then Bruce slashed Comyn in the chest before leaving the church, with Bruce’s men reportedly going in to finish the job.\nDepending on whose view you subscribe to, Comyn’s death was either pre-meditated murder or a reaction to Comyn’s ‘betrayal’ that he would not unite with Bruce against Edward I.\nWhatever the intention, Bruce was outlawed by the King and excommunicated by the Pope giving the killing in a Holy place - and then crowned king at Scone Abbey on March 27 1306.\nThe price of power was high. His wife and three daughters were imprisoned and three of his brothers executed, with Bruce going into exile on an island off Antrim.\nHe returned to Scotland and embarked on a new phase in the war against the English which peaked in victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in June 1314, where he defeated a much larger English army under Edward II.\nIn 1320, the Scottish earls, barons and the ‘community of the realm’ sent a letter to Pope John XXII declaring that Robert was their rightful monarch.\nThis ‘Declaration of Arbroath’ asserted the antiquity of the Scottish people and their monarchy and is considered by some to be the founding document of Scotland as a nation.\nSome commentators have highlighted how Robert the Bruce was motivated merely by the acquisition of land and feudal power.\n“It is true that no monarch after Bruce had to fight so hard to secure the throne and the kingdom but it is also true that he did so because that is what warlords do, “ wrote Andy Wightman, author and now MSP, in the Poor Had Lawyers.\n“Bruce was a member of a fractious elite class descended from Norman immigrants and his fight was a fight for feudal power, land and money.

{"text":"Lyft has pulled from service all of its on-demand electric bicycles in New York, Washington DC and the San Francisco Bay area after some riders reported issues with the brakes.\n\"We recently received a small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel. Out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively removing the pedal-assist bikes from service for the time being,\" the company said in a blog post .\nAbout 3,000 bikes will be pulled from service and will be replaced with regular bicycles. Altogether Lyft operates about 20,000 bikes in those three cities, with a mix of electric and regular models.\n\"After a small number of reports and out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively pausing our electric bikes from service in three markets. Safety always comes first,\" Lyft spokesperson Julie Wood said on Sunday.\nThe company said it has been \"hard at work on a new pedal-assist bike,\" and the model will be rolled out soon.\nLyft last year became the largest bikeshare operator in the United States when it acquired Motivate, owners of New York's Citi Bike and DC's Capital Bikeshare. That expanded its for-hire bikes to cities including Chicago, Boston, and Portland.\nLyft, which went public in March, has set out to end car ownership, primarily in the United States, with a suite of alternative transportation options. In addition to ride-sharing and bikes, the company has expanded into carpooling and scooter rentals.\nThe company beat its chief rival, Uber, to an IPO. According to its IPO prospectus, Lyft's share of the US ride-hailing market spiked to 39% in December 2018 from 22% at the end of 2016.\nLyft's Wall Street debut is seen as a bellwether for the long list of billion-dollar tech startups expected to go public later this year, including Pinterest, Slack, Postmates. Uber filed paperwork last week for what is expected to be the biggest public offering of the year.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T14:59:57Z","url":"https://www.abc15.com/news/national/lyft-pulls-electric-bicycles-in-dc-ny-and-san-francisco-after-reports-of-brake-issues"}

Jutra got started in filmmaking as a teenager and his early career was marked by winning awards and prizes in Canada and Europe for documentaries, short films and features, including A Chairy Tale (1957), Le Niger — Jeune Republique (1961), A tous prendre/Take It All (1963) and Comment Savoir (1966). His acknowledged masterpiece, the coming of age story Mon Oncle Antoine, won eight Canadian Film Awards, including best picture and best director. His next several films were not financially successful, and in the 1980s he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. In November of 1986 he disappeared. In March of 1987 his body was found in the St. Lawrence River, and his death was regarded as a suicide.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T12:21:41Z","url":"https://www.who2.com/bio/claude-jutra/"}
{"text":"President Obama seems so shell-shocked from all the political and media criticism about his “weakness” that he is “doing something” by intervening in both the Syrian and Iraqi civil conflicts, a risky “bias for action” that can do more harm than good, as ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar explains.\nA “bias for action” has long been a buzz phrase in the business world. Tom Peters and Robert Waterman in their best-selling book In Search of Excellence put the phrase at the top of their list of attributes of what they considered to be outstanding firms.\nFor an individual hoping to make it big in business, it’s not a bad phrase to keep in mind. Ambitious executives do not make names for themselves by saying they will take whatever organization they are responsible for and try not to screw it up. They make names by shaking things up. Moreover, the businesses with the most dramatic and admired garage-startup-to-behemoth histories necessarily had a bias for action.\nEven in business, however, the behavior implied by the phrase has limitations. What is good for the rising career of an individual executive is not necessarily good for the firm. And for every Apple or Amazon we have heard about, there are many more companies we have not heard about in which the leader’s bias for action led to unprofitable business lines, financial overextension, or other failures that caused the firm to crash and burn.\nApplied to foreign policy, the soundness of behavior implied by a bias for action is even more questionable. Perhaps it is most valid when trying to build an empire. Otto von Bismarck, for example, had a bias for action when using wars against other European states as a means for putting together the German Empire.\nBut for most states at most times, that is not the case. It is not the case for the United States today. The United States has a responsibility, to itself as well as to world order, less to build a bigger empire than to avoid screwing things up. And when the United States screws up, things can get very bad, not only because as the world’s only superpower it is more powerful than anyone else but also because with global involvement it has a lot of vulnerabilities that other states do not have. Crashing and burning is not an option.\nEven without the influence of business gurus such as Peters and Waterman, a bias for action is nonetheless at least as apparent in U.S. foreign policy as in commerce. One reason is the political pressure on leaders to be seen to be “doing something” about overseas problems. The partisan incentive to criticize opponents for doing nothing intensifies this pressure. In the United States the tendency is further exacerbated by a broader inclination to believe the United States ought to be able to solve any problem overseas.\nWe need to remember that a bias for action is exactly that: a bias. That means it is antithetical to an objective, unbiased assessment of what would be best for the United States to do or not to do. And that is not good. A bias for action has some of the qualities of the “ready, fire, aim” method of approaching a problem.\nWe can see some of these tendencies in the development of recent policy toward the turmoil in Iraq. The Obama administration’s dispatch of a few hundred U.S. military personnel, although they will be serving legitimate purposes, is probably best understood as a response to the pressure to do something. It probably was the minimum military measure the administration could get away with without incurring intense accusations of doing nothing.\nI was asked the other day to define U.S. objectives regarding the situation in Iraq. There are two ways to answer a question like that. One is the conventional way, which is the way any president or senior official would be expected to answer it. That way would mention things such as seeking regional stability and quashing terrorist threats against Americans.\nThe other way is to ask ourselves what are the most significant respects in which U.S. interests have been affected, for better or for worse, by developments in the Middle East over the past decade or so. Then our objective should be to repeat or build on what has affected our interests for the better, and to avoid repetition of the sorts of things that have affected them for the worse.\nBy far the most consequential development for U.S. interests in the region was the Iraq War, and its effects on U.S. interests were overwhelmingly negative, with the thousands of Americans killed, the tens of thousands injured, the trillions of dollars in economic costs, and the stimulation of sectarian warfare and terrorism that we face today. The number one objective for dealing with a situation like the one in Iraq is to avoid doing anything that could lead to a mistake similar to launching the Iraq War.\nNo president, of course, could get away with defining U.S. objectives that way. It would sound too passive, and it would not embody a bias for action. It would not pass muster with Peters and Waterman, and it certainly would not pass muster with political critics.\nThat’s too bad, because it is a very legitimate way to define a prime objective. It takes account of the most important ways in which U.S. interests have been affected, and it takes account of how in any unbiased analysis of how to pursue and protect those interests there is no reason either action or inaction should be favored.\nSay all of the right things, but take the easy way out, has been the American way.\nIf a prophetic gift is the gift of truth telling, Dylanâ€™s got it.\nA common reaction to ignorance and the lack of intelligent investigation and lack of any real attempt to understand… all of which can be laid at the base of lack of sensitivity for others and the failure of humanity to demand action to correct these inequities and injustices.\nI wonder – will we ever become civilized or just accept the veneer? The worrying part is that all this hypocrisy is out in the open the past 2 decades if not more and the American public just doesnâ€™t seem to care.\nThe guy is gutless! He hasn’t done anything to bring peace to the world. He sits behind his big desk, (probably admiring his, oh so well deserved, nobel peace prize) in the bomb shelter they call “the white house”, and bravely orders the deaths of anybody he wants. I would say he deserves a motorcade through Dallas, but that’s a trip for a President with real balls! I’ll never see another real leader, like that one, in my life time.\nIt may all be too late, but President Obama needs different people around him. I mean to tell you, as most of you consortiumnews readers already know, how our country needs to shed our government of the Neocon’s, etc type people. Oh, did I mention the Main Stream Media? Are they not something to write home about? Sometimes I just come away believing we are just flat out screwed.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T21:52:00Z","url":"https://consortiumnews.com/2014/06/27/obamas-new-bias-for-action/"}
{"text":"Diamond, a 60-year resident of Coral Gables, simply believed in teaching.\n“Other grandparents took their children to movies and carnivals. Billie took her grandchildren to the Everglades to see a comet at 3 a.m., to museums and libraries — ever the teacher,” her daughter said.\nThe New York-born Diamond, a board member of the Dranoff International 2 Piano Foundation, always called her own tune.\nAt her service, Diamond’s sister Joan Brenner spoke of an amusing World War II performance in which the former Beula Greenberg changed her named to Billie Vermont (a loose translation of Greenberg from the French word Vermont for green mountains.) Billie entertained service men with her signature song, A Bird in a Gilded Cage.\n“She wore a big feathered hat and a long gown with a huge bustle in the back. She would walk across the stage as she sang and the bustle, of course, followed. But occasionally — intentionally — she walked one way and the bustle crawled the other way. The soldiers howled. Guess who was inside the bustle?\nMany got to know Diamond. She, along with her husband, the late Jack Diamond, was among the 12 co-founders of Temple Beth Am in Kendall in 1955. “The house Billie and Jack built,” the rabbi said at her service. She loved playing piano so she served the Dranoff Foundation for more than 20 years. She was also a child advocate and volunteer with Guardian Ad Litem.\nIn 2000, Voices for Children honored Diamond as Guardian Ad Litem’s recipient of the Lorraine Munroe Outstanding Volunteer Award. “Known for her ‘never say no’ attitude and cheerful personality, Diamond has worked with the guardian program since 1986 and has overseen 32 children in 15 different cases,” the Miami Herald reported.\n“When she was into something her passion was unbounding and limitless,” her daughter said.\nIn addition to her daughter and sister, Diamond is survived by her children Barry and Dan Diamond, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Services were held. Donations in Diamond’s name can be made to the Dranoff International 2 Piano Foundation or Guardian Ad Litem.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T11:48:36Z","url":"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article31438118.html"}

A large photo of the Sawtooths dominates one wall. The wood tables and bar top were made by local artists.\nBarbarian, as the name suggests, prefers to do things the primitive way when it comes to making beer. Wood barrel-aged beers are all the rage in the world of brewing right now, and this new microbrewery favors the deep flavors that wood barrels impart.\nBut aging beer in wood barrels obviously takes time, and Barbarian won’t be releasing those brews for a few months. No worries, though. The brewery offers plenty of non-aged brews (made by James Long) to get things going.\n“We are starting right out of the gate with six beers,” Hovley says.\nBarbarian’s opening lineup includes Little Wolf IPA, The Commoner (a California common, aka steam-style brew), Saison, Dark Saison (fermented in Merlot barrels), Big Bad Wolf (imperial IPA fermented in Chardonnay barrels) and PostFunk, a dry-hopped sour beer.\nWhen the time comes, the brewery will offer its more mature, barrel-aged brews in 750-milliliter (24 ounce) bottles.\nBarbarian Brewing’s taproom, at 5270 W.

Also expect to find seasonal brews such as RIP Russian Imperial Stout.\nCounty Line Brewing is open 4 to 10 p.m. Friday; noon to 10 p.m. Saturday; and noon to 6 p.m. Sunday.\nTwo Boise breweries garnered medals for their stouts at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver on Sept. 24-26.\nBoise Brewing (www.boisebrewing.com), a community-funded microbrewery in Boise’s Central Addition district, brought home a silver medal for its Black Cliffs American Stout — made by head brewer Lance Chavez.\n10 Barrel Brewing Co.

{"text":"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A man was arrested Monday in the shooting death of a journalist who worked for the newspaper El Heraldo de Chiapas, and authorities were searching for three other people suspected of having ordered the killing.\nLuis Alberto Sanchez, a homicide prosecutor in the southern state of Chiapas, said in a video statement posted online that the detained man is believed to have acted as a lookout outside the home of reporter Mario Gomez.\nSanchez said the man allegedly belonged to a local drug gang and identified the gang’s leader, his right-hand man and the lieutenant’s wife as the purported intellectual authors of the murder.\nState and federal police in the town of Yajalon, where Gomez was slain, were under investigation by anti-corruption prosecutors to see if any might be implicated, Sanchez added.\nSurveillance camera video captured the moment Friday afternoon when two people rode by Gomez’s home on a motorcycle and the one in the rear fired at him. Neighbors went to his aid, but he did not survive. According to Chiapas prosecutors, he was struck by four bullets, and six shell casings were recovered at the scene.\nGomez, who had worked for El Heraldo de Chiapas for nearly a decade, was a general assignment reporter who covered a variety of topics including crime, security and political violence during the recent campaign for Mexico’s July 1 nationwide elections.\nTwo years ago, the media advocacy group Articulo 19 documented that Gomez had received death threats after publishing an investigation linking a congressman and an alternate lawmaker to purported corruption.\nMexico is one of the deadliest countries for journalists, with at least 10 slain so far this year and more than 30 killed during the six-year term of President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose term ends Dec. 1.\nJan-Albert Hootson, Mexico representative for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, urged authorities to determine whether Gomez’s killing came in retaliation for his work.\n“Journalists in Mexico will continue to fall victim to deadly violence when the killings of reporters linger in impunity,” Hootson said in a statement.\nOver the weekend, Chiapas prosecutors said Gomez’s journalistic work was the main line of investigation.\nChiapas was home to the 1994 uprising by Zapatista rebels, and political violence and conflicts over land are common in the state.\nIt is currently governed by the Green Party, but is set to come under control of the leftist Morena party of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, after the Greens lost the gubernatorial race two months ago.\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Gomez worked for the newspaper for nearly a decade, not more than a decade.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T20:23:18Z","url":"https://wtop.com/latin-america/2018/09/mexico-alleged-lookout-nabbed-in-murder-of-chiapas-reporter/"}

{"text":"championships and have made more appearances than any other senior hockey team at the Allan Cup in the past decade, but the championship itself has eluded them more times than they would’ve liked.\nOn Monday, they’ll begin their quest to fix that, seeking their fourth national title as they host the 2019 Viking Projects Allan Cup at the Gary Moe Auto Group Sportsplex in Lacombe.\nOn Sunday, they officially earned their way in as the Alberta provincial champions, despite being given a berth into the tournament as hosts, and they’re hoping that will help them finally capture that title.\n“It’s been a long time coming. I think with this team, the Allan Cup has been a goal every year and guys are chomping at the bit,” said Generals Captain Brennan Evans. “I think we’re doing exactly what we need to do…We’ve been doing things the right way for the most part.\nGenerals General Manager Jeff McInnis says losing the past few years has stung, but he’s unsure of anything tangible or within their control they could change to make sure the team does capture that championship.\n“When you’re talking about beating everyone and anyone, it comes down to the finest of wires. We were up 4-3 in the third period in last year’s final, and they scored two in the middle of the period and that was it,” he said. “I don’t have the answer beyond what it takes to build a team and we think we’ve built a very good team.\nThat said, he believes they’ve done everything they could to set themselves up for success.\n“I’m 100 per cent confident that our group couldn’t have worked any harder or been more diligent,” he said. “There’s nothing more we could do.\nThe Generals previously hosted the tournament in 2013 in Red Deer, but they feel this tournament will be even better, given their experience, and the fact the tournament is being held in a place they can call home.\nAs such, the tournament will act as somewhat of a housewarming party for the team.\nIt was just four years ago that the then-Bentley Generals announced they would leave the community of Bentley in December 2015, due to attendance, and finished their 2015-16 season playing in Lacombe, where it became clear they’d found a new place to take root.\nIn the spring, the move, and a change of name from the Bentley Generals to the Lacombe Generals took place. Renovations commenced on the Gary Moe Auto Group Sportsplex, and half way through the first season they officially stepped onto the ice for the first time in their new home.\nIt took a couple of seasons to fully settle in – the most recent of which saw the Generals paint the bleachers in their characteristic blue and gold – but they’re happy with the way the community has embraced them.\nNot that there aren’t still changes they’d like to see in the area of support.\nSenior hockey is always a struggle financially, given the leagues are “working mens leagues” and they’re not able to play as many games or promote themselves in the way major junior teams and other levels might.\nEven this year, the Generals played at the start of March, and didn’t take the ice at home for fans until March 31, which he said is “devastating” in terms of keeping them relevant.\nHowever, the 2019 Viking Projects Allan Cup promises to have packed stands every night, and they’re down to about 150 tickets left per game, so those looking to purchase at the door ahead of the games may want to get there early if they don’t want to purchase in advance.\n“It’ll be down to slim pickings. There’s not a lot left,” said McInnis.\nFortunately, should any games be sold out, the Molson Canadian Hockey House, which will be located in the Freightliner of Red Deer Curling Complex next door to the arena, will have three large projection screens displaying the broadcast of the games and the TSN final.\nFor more details, visit www.allancup.ca.\nThe Innisfail Eagles are making history, appearing at the Allan Cup tournament for the first time in the franchise’s 71 years.\nAnd they’re looking to make up for both their Allan Cup Hockey West finals and Hockey Alberta Provincial Senior AAA finals losses which came at the Lacombe Generals.\nInnisfail finished third in ACHW standings in the regular season with a 9-8-0-1 record, and made it to the ACHW finals where they were swept by the Generals 3-0 in a best-of-five series.\nInnisfail then had to duke it out with the Stony Plain Eagles in a best-of-seven provincial semifinal, where they bested their opponents four games to two, including a 5-4 overtime victory in Game 6 to secure an Allan Cup berth. In the provincial final, however, they came up short, losing by an aggregate score of 7-4 to Lacombe (See Page 13 for more).\nThe team may not be on home ice, but they’re sure to have a numerous fans in the stands at every game – especially considering their roster features a pair of Lacombe brothers in Blair and Taylor Mulder.\nThe Eagles will be forced to practice in Red Deer ahead of the tournament, as the ice is being taken out in their home arena. They will play in the opening game of the tournament on April 8 against the Rosetown Red Wings at 4 p.m.\nA year ago, the Rosetown Red Wings were the hosts of the Allan Cup tournament and came up short with a 0-1-2-0 record that saw them fall in the quarterfinals.\nThis year, as the Saskatchewan representatives, they’ll look to not just improve upon that, but go all the way and win their first Allan Cup.\nIn the regular season, the Red Wings and Lacombe Generals fought for first place in ACHW standings all year, with their 11-7-0-0 record and +10 goal differential being edged by Lacombe’s 10-6-0-2 record and +12 goal differential for top spot.\nIn ACHW playoffs, the Red Wings were bounced in the first round by the Innisfail Eagles 3-0 in a best-of-five series.\nRosetown last made the finals in 2012 where they were defeated 4-1 by the South East Prairie Thunder, and they also participated in the 2013 tournament hosted by the Bentley Generals in Red Deer.\nThe South East Prairie Thunder, like the Lacombe Generals, are also no strangers to the Allan Cup, making their seventh straight appearance at the tournament, and so it’s only fitting the two teams will play each other first in the tournament on April 8.\nThe Prairie Thunder, who are based in Steinbach, Man., have made nine total appearances at the tournament. Their first was in 2009, where they made it all the way to the final, but were bested 4-3 in double overtime to the then-Bentley Generals.\nThey won their first Allan Cup in 2012 where they defeated the Rosetown Redwings 4-1. Their second Allan Cup came in 2015, where they shutout Bentley 2-0.\nThey were also finalists in 2016.\nThis year, they punched their ticket to the tournament by sweeping the Ste. Anne Aces in their best-of-three Hockey Manitoba Provincial Senior AAA finals series, including a 4-3 double overtime victory and a 4-0 shutout.\nThe Stoney Creek Generals, who hail from a community in Hamilton, Ont., are just six years old, but already are trying to do what no team has done in over 30 years – win the Allan Cup in back-to-back years.\nLast year, the team won the Allan Cup for the first time, defeating the Lacombe Generals 7- 4 in the final.\nThis year, they’ll make their fourth consecutive appearance at the tournament after winning the Allan Cup Hockey league’s regular season with an 18-5-1 record, and sweeping the Whitby Dunlops 4-0 in a the best-of-seven Roberston Cup finals series.\nStoney Creek’s first game of the tournament will be on Tuesday, April 9 against the Innisfail Eagles at 4 p.m. They will play the Rosetown Redwings at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, April 10.\nThe Haut-Madawaska Panthers will not only be representing their own community of St. Francois de Madawaksa in New Brunswick, but the entire Atlantic region at the Allan Cup as Newfoundland and Labrador chose not to send a representative this year.\nThe team plays in the Circuit de Hockey Senior Roger-Lizotte, and were the 2017-18 playoff champions. This year, they fell in semifinals to the St. Quentin Castors four games to three in a best-of-seven series, but had a 21-5-0-2 record in the regular season.\nThe Panthers have no prior Allan Cup tournament history.\nFor more information on the tournament and schedule, visit www.allancup.ca.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T01:11:04Z","url":"https://www.lacombeglobe.com/sports/local-sports/generals-aiming-to-win-it-all-at-2019-viking-projects-allan-cup"}

It kept the crowd going till the pontoon docked back to the jetty in the wee hours. Her celebrations are always such.\nI have known Prithi for many decades and throughout these years, to me, she has come across as a positive person. Generous to a fault, always hosting great parties and at the same time doing great charitable deeds. The latter is done in the quiet and sans publicity.\nChatting with Prithi recently I learned that a media person who always thought she was doing a great honour by featuring Prithi had the gumption to say to her that it was she who had made Prithi well known in Colombo. Fortunately, Prithi knew her for what she was. A crafty fox trying to enhance her financial benefits from Prithi. Colombo is a small fish pond and in reality one does not need humongous publicity to be known. On top of it, Prithi also knew that this fox bad mouths her to other women and benefits financially from them in return.\nPrithi is a clever and intelligent business woman and independent in her own right. Like all successful people, she will always have those who will dislike her and happy to relate a bad tale or two about her.

{"text":"The fifth one was the sweetest. And the most difficult to achieve.\nThe Sockers' postgame championship trot around the field at the Sports Arena and the trophy looked familiar, but this title was different.\nThis time, the Sockers were the underdogs. They were the ones fighting for their lives.\nThe Sockers won their third straight do-or-die game to win their fifth consecutive indoor championship Monday night at the San Diego Sports Arena.\nA sellout crowd of 12,881 screaming fans saw the Sockers defeat the Minnesota Strikers, 5-3, to win the best-of-seven Major Indoor Soccer League championship series four games to three.\n\"This was probably the hardest,\" said Socker Coach Ron Newman, who had just hugged his wife, Olive, during the postgame ceremonies at midfield.\n\"We Are the Champions\" started blasting on the loud speaker. Again.\n\"This is definitely and without a doubt the sweetest of all,\" said Socker forward Ade Coker, who has been on all five championship teams. \"To come from 3-1 down (in games) has to say a lot for the character of the team.\"\nAccused of being whiners and complainers, the Sockers showed they also have a lot of heart. And in the final three games of the series, they were magical.\nSocker midfielder Brian Quinn--as inspirational as he has been fiesty throughout the championship series--had two goals and an assist.\nQuinn was awarded the playoff Most Valuable Player award. He had 13 goals and 10 assists in 15 playoff games and five goals and two assists in the championship series.\n\"This is the first thing I've ever won individually,\" Quinn said. \"I never had this much attention in my life. But it could have gone to five or six guys. We all realize how valuable everyone is. I love them all.\"\nA nonstop runner and fighter and scrapper, Quinn also had seven blocked shots. Most came while he played on the penalty-killing unit.\nQuinn is consistently good at everything he does.\n\"He looks like he's enjoying himself and he doesn't seem to feel the pressure,\" Newman said. \"Quinnie just has great games and good games. And that's great for the coach.\"\nIn the championship series, Quinn also refused to let his teammates get too demoralized when the Sockers trailed three games to one.\n\"After we lost the fourth game in Minnesota,\" Quinn said, \"we looked at ourselves and realized there wasn't enough intensity.\"\nQuinn continually told his teammates, \"It isn't over yet.\"\nThe Sockers regrouped for a 7-4 victory in the fifth game in San Diego and a very emotional 6-3 victory Friday night at the Met Center that tied the series.\nEntering Monday's night Game 7, the Sockers were a confident, but injury-riddled team that had a 27-1 mark in home playoff games.\nCaptain Jean Willrich did not play much because of his strained right groin. Midfielder Hugo Perez and defender Brain Schmetzer also played with injuries.\nDespite playing with a bruised left knee and ankle, Juli Veee took regular shifts and had two assists.\n\"It is a marvelous feeling,\" Veee said. \"It is very emotional. I am sad that Jean (Willrich) couldn't play, but I am very happy for the young players.\"\nThe Strikers were healthy, but also still were recovering from the disappointment of not wrapping up the series at home.\n\"Before the game,\" said Socker defender Fernando Clavijo, \"I saw that they were really down. When we scored those three goals, they really had no chance.\"\nSan Diego led 1-0 after one quarter and 2-1 at halftime. The Sockers took control with two goals in the third quarter and another early in the final period to make it 4-1.\nSocker goalkeeper Jim Gorsek made 20 saves on 46 shots. That's right, the Sockers were outshot 46-22. Five San Diego penalties for 10 minutes was partly responsible.\n\"Gorsek was tremendous,\" said Striker midfielder Ray Hudson.\nSo was the Socker offense on five occasions.\nThe Sockers won \"One for the Thumb\"--their rallying cry for a fifth championship ring.\nSockers 1 Strikers 0: Quinn when he got the rebound of his own shot and lined a left-footed half volley from inside the penalty area at 7:08 of the first quarter. Coker got an assist.\nThe Sockers did what they said they had to do. They scored the first goal.\nSockers 1, Strikers 1: On Minnesota's third power-play attempt of the half, Jan Goossens lined a 30-foot right-footer from the right wing at the eight-minute mark of the second quarter.\nScokers 2, Strikers 1: Big, big goal. Just 17 seconds after Goossens scored, Collier lined a low line drive past Lettieri. Collier took a pass from Veee and knocked the ball inside the left post. Assist Veee.\nIt was only the second goal of the playoffs for Collier, who scored the game-winner in the Sockers' 7-6 overtime win against St. Louis in the opening game of the first round playoff series.\nSockers 3, Strikers 1: At 1:18 of the third quarter, Quinn and Branko Segota teamed up on a two-on-one break. Segota to Quinn to Segota, who placed a left-footer from the top of the circle past Lettieri. Assist Quinn. Momentum Sockers.\nSockers 4, Strikers 1: Gorsek threw a perfect outlet pass to Quinn at the second red line. Quinn took a few dribbles and slid a right-footer into the far corner of the net at 6:24 of the third quarter. Assist Gorsek.\nThe fans started to taste the championship.\nSockers 5, Strikers 1: Coker tapped a rebound in the net from in front of the goal. Assist Veee.\nPostgame celebrations were being discussed in the stands.\nMike Jeffries and Thompson Usiyan scored for Minnesota within a two-minute span in the fourth quarter to make it 5-3 with 4:17 left in the game.\n\"Just another typical San Diego Socker season,\" said smiling Socker defender Kevin Crow.\nMaybe even a little sweeter.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T00:35:33Z","url":"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-05-27-sp-7476-story.html"}
{"text":"UNITED NATIONS, September 26, 2010 -- The Obama administration's less critical stand on the military government in Myanmar has been on display of late.\nIn the run up to the September 27 meeting at the UN of the Group of Friends of the Secretary General on Myanmar, Inner City Press has been asking a range of Obama administration officials what the US position in the meeting, and on Myanmar, will be.\nFirst, Inner City Press asked the Myanmar question to a senior US official who gave a briefing to preview the General Debate. The official, who has spoken about Sudan, Iran and a range of other topics, said they hadn't been briefed on Myanmar.\nBut two days later, still no answer had been provided. After another US briefing, about President Obama's two speeches at the UN, Inner City Press tried again to get the US position.\nAs transcribed below, the State Department spokesman's presentation to Inner City Press of the US position on Myanmar and the meeting initially seems strong, critical of the military government of Than Shwe and other generals, but ultimately uses the support of China and India for Myanmar as a reason not to push for much.\nSome point out that the Obama administration, loudly, does not allow Chinese support for Sudan to stop it from publicly speechifying about Sudan, and being seen to “apply pressure” to the al Bashir government.\nWhy has the US, as some see it, given up on Burma? Watch this site.\nInner City Press: Do you remember my Myanmar question. Did I miss a briefing of yours?\nCrowley: No. There is a friend of Myanmar meeting on Monday. We will be participating. And we'll go through a full range of issues. Obviously our concerns about the human rights climate are well known. We have been encouraging Myanmar to open up political space. Clearly they have failed to do that. We have been encouraging them to have a serious dialogue with the various ethnic groups which compose their population. They haven't done that. The electoral laws that they've passed for the election later this fall we believe will not lead to a credible result. Just taking generals out of uniform and making them civilians is not enough. Part of the challenge with Burma is also working more collaboratively with other countries some of whom do have strong relations with Burma. To settle on a common approach and then see if we can't together demonstrate to Burma there are definitely things that they have to do.\nInner City Press: You mean India as well as China?\nInner City Press: There's this call for an international inquiry into war crimes in Burma which was made by the UN rapporteur. France has just said there's going pursue it in this GA. It was never clear to people if the Obama administration joined that call There were some articles where a senior US official said they supported the call but it was never.. I don't know what that meant. Do you know what I'm referring to?\nCrowley Yeah I do. I don't know if that's going to be brought up at this meeting or not. Let's wait and see.\nIf the Obama administration were really behind this call for an inquiry into war crimes in Burma, it seems unlikely that the State Department spokesman would say “let's wait and see” if the issue comes up at the September 27 meeting the US is participating in.

Microsoft shuttered the program last June, but its spirit lives on in the form of FatWallet Cash Back. It's ridiculously easy to use, and the only cost is a minute or two of your time.\nStart by signing up for an account, which requires little more than your name and e-mail address. Wait for your confirmation e-mail to arrive, then click the link to activate your account. Now you're all set to start shopping.\nLet's say you're in the market for some flowers for Mother's Day. Instead of going directly to, say, 1-800-Flowers.com, you'd head to FatWallet's Cash Back Stores page, search for that store, then click through to it using FatWallet's affiliate link. From there you just browse and buy as usual.\nFlash forward several months. (Yes, it takes that long--this is not unlike waiting on a rebate check. And I suppose that's the \"catch.\") After FatWallet receives confirmation from the merchant that you've paid for your product (and haven't returned it), you'll see a Cash Back credit in your account.\nThe amount varies from one store to another--it might be three percent of your total purchase price, or eight percent, or even 15. When you're ready to turn that credit into actual money, you can request a check or a direct transfer to your PayPal account. I recommend reading the FAQ page so there are no surprises along the way.\nAlthough a few percentage points might not seem like much, it can definitely add up--especially on big purchases. If you drop $800 on a new TV, and the merchant is offering 10 percent, that's $80 back in your pocket. And if you place a monthly order with, say, the Vitamin Shoppe, you'll get seven percent back every single time.\nThus, for anyone who regularly shops online, FatWallet can save you a decent chunk of change. I'd go so far as to say it's crazy not to use it, as there's absolutely no downside I can see (except the long wait for your cash back).","timestamp":"2019-04-18T11:21:58Z","url":"https://www.pcworld.com/article/225325/shopping.html"}
{"text":"In your lifetime, you've wished upon many stars.\nYou've spotted a twinkle in the night sky and hoped for love or fulfillment of a dream. You've wished for good grades, better money, the return of a loved one. And sometimes, you've wished for the impossible.\nBut was the wish fulfilled, or was the star just another ball of gas? For a woman in the 1850s, it was the latter: In \"The Rebellion of Miss Lucy Ann Lobdell\" by William Klaber, Lucy futilely wished she was a man.\nOn the morning when she cut her hair, donned her brother's clothes, and slipped from her parents' house before daybreak, Lucy Slater left more than a wretched life behind.\nShe also left her daughter, Helen, which tore her heart. Still, the decision to flee wasn't difficult.\nThree years prior, Lucy's husband abandoned his family, leaving them with nothing and forcing them to live with Lucy's parents. Since she'd married against parental approval, there was only hostility in their home - a situation made worse because they knew that Lucy was most comfortable in the woods, wearing her little brother's clothes. That was unseemly for a lady in upstate New York, 1855.\nMen had it so much better. They could live without care, wearing breeches and shirts. They could hold jobs that paid a decent days' wage. She envied them. So Lucy Slater boarded a train headed east, and became Joseph Lobdell.\nFearing that he'd be unmasked, Joseph kept to himself until he could grab a barge to Honesdale, Pennsylvania. There, he played the violin for patrons in a downtown inn, and he started a dancing school for the young ladies of the growing city. Honesdale was also where Joseph fell in love with a 17-year-old named Lydia.\nSounds like a good adventure yarn, doesn't it? It is - and it's even more enjoyable, once you know that \"The Rebellion of Miss Lucy Ann Lobdell\" is based on real life.\nIn his after-notes, author William Klaber says he learned about Lucy Lobdell Slater from a writer-friend who wanted the story told. Knowing that the dearth of facts could hinder a biography, Klaber decided to fill in the blanks with fiction.\nThis book is none the lesser for it.\nIn giving Lucy the voice of narrator, Klaber lends a sure vulnerability that surprisingly lingers, and wistfulness that adds a note of sadness. He also gives her a feisty single-mindedness and keen awareness that what she was doing wasn't just scandalous but was downright criminal. Readers who remember that important point will love this book as much as I did.\nPerfect for historians, feminists, and anybody who enjoys historical fiction, this novel is a definite winner. If that's you, then look for it because \"The Rebellion of Miss Lucy Ann Lobdell\" gets five stars.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T23:49:37Z","url":"https://www.blufftontoday.com/sun-city/2013-07-03/winner-if-you-historical-fiction"}

{"text":"A move to Fridays is rarely a good sign for a TV show, which was the case for Raising Hope last fall. So while it's certainly disappointing news that the series has been cancelled by Fox, it's not entirely surprising, all things considered. Still, we're going to miss the Chance family!\nDeadline reported the news, stating that the current fourth season of Raising Hope will be its last, and the series will wrap-up with an hour-long farewell on Friday, April 4.\nThe premise of Greg Garcia's series centers on a twenty-something guy whose one-night-stand with a serial killer results in the birth of a daughter named Hope, whom Jimmy ends up raising. But the bigger picture is the series' emphasis on the Chances, a blue-collar family living a simple life and doing what they can to raise Hope right. In addition to Lucas Neff, who plays Jimmy, the cast includes Martha Plimpton, Garret Dillahunt, Shannon Woodward and Cloris Leachman. Of all the characters, i was always a fan of Plimpton and Dillahunt's Virginia and Burt, as their history and the evident love they have for one another often yielded some of the funniest bits on the series.\nMeanwhile, we're left to wonder the fate of some of FOX's other comedies. Fox just gave early renewals to New Girl, The Following, The Mindy Project and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but there's no word yet on the fate of Dads and Enlisted. If I had to choose between the two, I hope Enlisted makes the cut, and is preferably moved to a better timeslot, especially now that Raising Hope is going off the air, but we'll have to wait and see.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T16:23:06Z","url":"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Raising-Hope-Cancelled-Season-4-Its-Last-62714.html"}
{"text":"The St. Johns River Water Management District Governing Board approved a tentative budget Tuesday that reduces the property tax rate while continuing to fund initiatives to protect the region’s springs and the Indian River Lagoon.\nAll property owners in Flagler County, including all its cities, pay the water management district’s tax. Flagler is one of 18 counties in the St. Johns district.\nThe tentative 0.3283 millage rate (or 32.8 cents per $1,000 in taxable value) is about a 1 percent decrease from the current year’s millage rate and would result in $80.6 million in property tax revenue for the district. The total $135.5 million proposed budget is slated to be funded with the property tax revenue, plus state, federal and other sources (including timber sales, cattle leases, interest earnings, permit fees and fund balances).\nFor Flagler County residents, the tax rate means that a property owner with a $150,000 house and a $50,000 homestead exemption will have a $33 bill from the district. The tax bill is included as a line-item among all other municipal, school and county taxes. The owner of a $200,000 house with a $50,000 homestead exemption would pay $49.25.\nThe proposed budget includes at least $13.3 million in cooperative funding for 22 reclaimed water and water conservation projects, springshed nutrient-reduction projects, and enhancements to wastewater treatment and water distribution systems with local governments and other entities.\nConstruction of the Fellsmere Water Management Area and the second phase of the Canal 1 Rediversion Project in Brevard and Indian River counties, which are among the final components of the Upper St. Johns River Basin Project.\nProjects to reduce nutrient pollution in Lake Apopka in Orange and Lake counties and Lake George in Putnam and Volusia counties and downstream water bodies by removing “rough fish” species, primarily gizzard shad.\nOn-farm and regional water management cost-share projects that reduce nutrient discharges to the St. Johns River, improve water conservation, and result in more efficient farmmanagement in the Tri-County Agricultural Area of Flagler, Putnam and St. Johns counties.\nExpanding data collection to support priority District initiatives.\nThe Board approved a ranking of applications that provides funding for 22 projects with local governments and other entities in fiscal year 2013-2014, which begins Oct. 1. The projects will be located in nine counties — Alachua, Clay, Duval, Flagler, Lake, Marion, Orange, Seminole and Volusia. The 22 projects represent a total of $59 million in construction costs among all of the partners.\nThe District received 42 cooperative funding project applications during the submittal period that ended May 1. The 22 projects slated for funding emerged as priority projects following an intensive and objective evaluation of each application.\nPublic hearings on the tentative budget will be held at 5:05 p.m. on Sept. 10 and 24. Final budget adoption will occur at the Sept. 24 meeting at the district’s Palatka headquarters at 4049 Reid Street.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T06:36:43Z","url":"https://flaglerlive.com/56427/stjohns-water-management-district-taxes/"}

{"text":"Gene Blevins/ReutersA tornado in Kansas last week. A new poll suggests the public feels that global warming is real.\nSunday will be the 42nd annual Earth Day celebration. Here are 10 ideas for commemorating the day, observed each year on April 22, or exploring issues related to the environment in the classroom or home on any day of the year.\nWhen was the first Earth Day (PDF), and what major themes did it address? Are these themes still relevant today? How has Earth Day changed since 1970? In the past five or 10 years? Since the year in which you were born? How had public attitudes and environmental concerns changed by the time Earth Day hit 20 and “shed its humble roots”? How has going global shifted its focus? And how has “green” turned into big business 40 years later?\nAfter searching for Earth Day coverage over the years in the Times archives, students make posters intended to aesthetically and thematically represent Earth Day celebrations from various years.\nAlternatively, they investigate who coordinated the first Earth Day and what personal experiences shaped his attitude about preserving the environment. They then reflect on what factors have influenced how they consider the environment and make posters representing what Earth Day means to them.\nWhat do you know about Earth Day and the environment? Students test their knowledge with our student crosswords about Earth Day or global warming.\nOr, students create quizzes intended to test others’ knowledge of major environmental events since 1940. Another way to do the quiz is to list the events on the board and have students try to put them in chronological order.\nTo follow up, ask students how they might get to know the natural features of the place where they live, like rivers, lakes, woodlands, fields, rock formations or even mountains. Can they identify the common plant and animal species that live in the community? Have them annotate a map of the neighborhood around your school with these features and note the species you would expect to find there.\nIf possible, take your class on a sense of place field trip, using tools like Environment Canada’s Urban BioKit or Nature BioKit as guides for students to complete as you walk around your school’s neighborhood or to a nearby park.\nAfter their exploration, students read the Scientist at Work blog post “Biodiversity, and Green Slugs, in Action,” noting the number of species the author lists in her column. Using this column as inspiration, they then write a similar essay on their experience of the sense of place walk.\nA growing number of scientists and conservationists suggest that the best way to preserve and protect the Earth is to focus less on restoring degraded lands to a former, “pristine” condition and more on preserving what we can while accepting that people are a part of Earth’s ecosystems. After reading the Op-Ed “Hope in the Age of Man,” students discuss its main ideas: what is the “Anthropocene,” and why do some environmentalists see it as a “disaster”? What do the authors have to say about it? Do students agree with the authors’ assertion that “We can accept the reality of humanity’s reshaping of the environment without giving up in despair”?\nAlternatively, use our lesson “Will It Happen Again? Examining Mass Extinctions on Earth” to explore the perspective some scientists hold that humans are responsible for a major extinction on Earth.\nWhat actions can you take to provide shelter for wildlife in your community? As a class or as a school community, consider following the National Wildlife Federation’s guidelines for building a Schoolyard Habitat. Students might encourage their families to use native plants in their own gardens at home.\nOr, taking a page from City Room’s Hawk Cam project, they monitor a local family of birds or other species and blog about their observations and provide tips for how local people can help animal and plant life thrive.\nStudents assess risks in their regions like rising sea levels and flooding as well as extreme weather and how public opinion about the connections between climate change and these risks help shape politics.\nStudents can also use the Times Topics pages on global warming and climate change to brush up on the latest news and provide their classmates with regular updates.\nYou might also take a look at Andrew C. Revkin’s Dot Earth blog posts “What’s A Science Teacher to Do?” and “Climate in Classrooms” or the editorial “Pseudoscience and Tennessee’s Classrooms.” Why is climate change – and the teaching of it in school – hotly debated? Where do you stand? What is your school or district’s policy?\nUse our lesson “How Green Is My School? Conducting an Energy Audit” to determine the school’s use of energy.\nNext, students read up on green building projects like the energy- and carbon-neutral headquarters of Seattle’s Bullitt Foundation, which is headed up by Denis Hayes, coordinator of the first Earth Day observation, and net-zero energy buildings. They identify some commercial buildings that meet this standard or have achieved other aspects of high performance buildings. They then brainstorm and propose ways to make their homes or schools achieve a net-zero energy balance.\nStudents explore the concept of geoengineering, or developing technological solutions to climate change caused by human activity. Are geoengineering approaches more feasible than those meant to limit the emission of greenhouse gases? Should we pursue some of these methods, like deflecting sunlight away from earth? What are some potential pitfalls to geoengineering? How might simpler solutions, like installing cool roofs, help mitigate atmospheric warming? How environmentally friendly are so-called “green” products? Hold a classroom debate.\nHow is the environment represented in entertainment and culture? What messages do these aspects of popular culture send? What celebrities are associated with environmentalism, and what impact does their activism have? Students choose a specific film, television show, magazine feature or other aspect of culture that features nature or the environment to assess and analyze for its messages and effectiveness at fostering awareness.\nBecause my family moves around alot it made me think of all the Earth Day celebrations that my schools have done, sometimes we did a green up day and others we had a picnic outside in a local deer park. My mom told me a little about Earth day when she was younger. It was really interesting to learn.\nHowever a long ago it was… I vividly remember each student getting a packet of lima bean seeds. It was our MISSION to successfully grow the plant throughout the rest of the year. This was when I visually learned about how plants literally learn towards sunlight.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T21:22:08Z","url":"https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/earth-day-and-all-days-10-ways-to-learn-about-the-environment/"}
{"text":"The security vendor Avast has received a $100m investment from private equity firm Summit Partners, in exchange for a minority stake in the company.\nAvast chief executive Vince Steckler described the $100m (£64m) deal on Monday as \"a vote of confidence in our disruptive 'freemium' business model\", which sees the vendor giving its product — including updates — for free to millions of non-corporate users.\nThe company's current model is based around providing its antivirus program, which contains similar features to competitors' paid-for offerings, to home users for free. As with rival antivirus firm AVG, this is done in the hope that those customers will then upgrade to a paid-for premium version.\nAvast also provides a number of business-tailored products that attract an annual subscription fee in exchange for security features. The firm's freemium model has already netted the security specialist approximately 100 million registered subscribers, according to a statement from the company.\n\"[This approach] is already upsetting the traditional antivirus market,\" said Steckler. \"Instead of paying for advertising or installation on new computers, Avast continues to experience dramatic growth as fans of Avast recommend our products to their friends. Freemium is the wave of the future... We have no plans to change our approach and conform to the classic retail positioning model.\"\nAs part of Monday's deal, Scott Collins, managing director of Summit Partners, will get a seat on Avast's board of directors.

We were in the Apple Store, which I started going to frequently after I purchased a Mini Mac to play with, and we noticed that our oldest son was really interested in an iPod. Since it was right after his birthday, we thought that an iPod Mini might be a good idea, and he was quite enthusiastic about it. Since I had just bought a Mini Mac recently, I was motivated to buy another Apple product (the Mini Mac is really cool, more on that another time).\nPASADENA, CA - In another article I mentioned that one of the reasons for the purchase of the iPod was that I would exercise more. Now that I own one, do I exercise more? The answer is … yes!\nOne of my joys of owning an iPod is walking around the city I live in, Pasadena, and escaping from the moment through the magic of the music. With the tunes that I want to hear a few quick flicks of my fingers away, I wander the neighborhood slowly, window shopping, observing my fellow pedestrians, casting an indifferent eye at traffic, all while enjoying the serenity of the iPod experience. I’ve entered the local record shop (yes, it still exists and it does sell some records) listening to the new Gorillaz album Demon Days, and exited later immersed in the Overture from Tannhäuser. I have the freedom, which wasn’t possible before my iPod, to listen to any of the 5300 + songs on it, all of which I own legally, at any place and at any time!\nI have a confession to make. I’ve always wanted one, maybe even secretly desired one. Professional curiosity, the coolness factor, the desire to work with something different, I’m not sure what it was exactly, probably a bit of all of them all, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the cost of adopting a new platform.\nRob Sullivan is a SEO Consultant and Writer for http://www.textlinkbrokers.com.

{"text":"GARY CAHILL has not yet won a Premier League title, unlike some other members of the Chelsea squad.\nBut right now the England defender can scent one on the horizon –and he wants it.\nJose Mourinho’s Chelsea squad still has a core of players who know what it takes to win a title, men like John Terry, Frank Lampard, Petr Cech, Ashley Cole, Michael Essien and John Obi Mikel.\nThey are players who have been the distance, know the pitfalls, know what it takes over the nine hard months of the English season.\nCoupled with the fast emerging, exciting young talent that is slowly but surely this season turning Chelsea into genuine contenders, Cahill believes that his side now have what it takes.\nChelsea’s comprehensive 3-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday at Stamford Bridge not only virtually ended any hope David Moyes’ side had of being contenders. It also made their hopes of a top four place all that more demanding.\nPerhaps, more importantly though, Chelsea’s clinical dominance of the game against their old rivals showed for perhaps the first time that Jose Mourinho’s side are beginning to be forged into a genuine force by the Portuguese, after an uncertain start to the campaign.\nCahill, 28, sees the hunger that still resides in players like Terry and Lampard for a fourth title in the Roman Abramovich era and he shares it.\nHe said: “It’s one of the biggest trophies you can win and I’m sure the lads who have won it before would say the same thing. They’re just as hungry as me to do it again.\nThe victory took Mourinho’s record of unbeaten home games in the league in his two spells in charge to 71 now.\nCahill said: “It is an incredible record and one day it will come to an end, but hopefully not too soon.\n“We have confidence whenever we play at home, which we should have, and always manage to get results here.\n“Hopefully that will continue for the rest of the season, but the main thing for us is consistency, to keep performing every week. The lads have got the drive to do that right now and things are going well.\n“United are not having the season they would have hoped for, but nevertheless that was a huge fixture no matter how you look at it so we’re obviously very pleased.\n“I don’t want to jinx the record – but we do turn up against the big teams. We’ve put in good performances against them and not dropped too many points. If we can stay consistent, which at the moment we are, we have a good feeling among the group and we’re going about our business quietly. Arsenal and Man City are not dropping points either, but this was a great win for us.\n“We are going about our business quietly. Hopefully we keep moving forward. We’re starting to play better, we’re defending well. We’re around the top, just a few points behind.\nChelsea are unbeaten in seven games against the top teams this season, and their match at in-form Manchester City at the Etihad on Monday week has been touted by pundits as a possible early title decider.\nBut Cahill does not see it like that. He said: “I don’t think it’s a decider. There is a long way to go, we’re just over halfway through the season. There have been times where we’ve slipped up and they’ve slipped up away from home.\n“We know how devastating they are at home, it’s going to be tough. We beat them here and it’s going to be even harder up there to get a result. It’s one to look forward too.\nMourinho, meanwhile, celebrated the win in painful fashion as he flew to Paris yesterday for surgery on an old elbow injury.\nAnd Samuel Eto’o says he wants to end his career with Mallorca.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T16:11:04Z","url":"https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/455029/Chelsea-star-Gary-Cahill-aiming-to-taste-Premiership-success"}
{"text":"How do I know when I should exit a trade?\nAre there some rules on this that I can follow?\nMany traders approach their strategy with one thing in mind: establishing the qualifications for entry. The ‘edge’ if you will. From there, the trade should take care of itself, right? Not really. How you manage a trade after it has been taken is perhaps the most important dynamic to a true strategy (as opposed to approaching the market trade by trade). Once in a trade, you have cast your line; and the result will ultimately be a gain or a loss. Yet, unless you think this one trade will make you wealthy enough to retire after its closed; it is important to establish some consistent (if flexible) parameters for when you should exit the market with a profit or (preferably) a tolerable loss. What are the considerations you should account for when looking for the exit?\nThe first rule for plotting your exit is to have some notion of how you will get out of your trade before you even put it on. For those traders that are utter beginners, we usually hammer home the concept of defining a hard stop and target before you even enter a position. This is just a suggestion to instill good habits – namely: don’t trade with emotions. That being said, absolutes aren’t conducive to trading. You need to retain some level of flexibility for a market and financial structure that is adaptable. Nonetheless, we still need to establish some ground rules; because a preconceived notion of an exit can bring significant clarity to the success or failure of your trade. It is a good exercise to ask yourself in the middle of a trade whether this is a good position or not and why. Even those supremely confident in their trading skills and can answer the first question will still have to take a cold hard look at their reasoning.\nWhen going about establishing exit points, you should consider a ‘graceful’ exit whether you have a winning or losing trade. Both scenarios should be accounted for on the initial development of the trade. A stop is pretty straight forward. If the market has broken a specific technical level or the notional loss on the position breaches your tolerance level, it is time to exit and reassess (never right-off a pair altogether, you will have to trade the pair again sometime in the future). Yet, I like to combine technicals and money management when establishing my own stops. I will typically only risk 1 to 5 percent of my total equity on any single trade. That is a hard fast rule. Now, I look at the technical scenario. If a reasonable place to set my stop is too far from the entry or it happens to be very close, I will use that level and simply alter my position size such that my total risk will always fit that 1 to 5 percent rule while maintaining the technical setup.\nTargets are a different story. As it is often said: “you should cut your losers and let your winners run.” This is advice to live by; but how? Well, we have capped our losses; but balancing your take-profit is more difficult. The first thing to do is refer back to your stop. How much risk did you take on the outlay? Your trade should be able to compensate for that risk and more. But, how do we do this without leaving the trade open to emotions taking control and stopping a trade out too soon or keeping it on for so long that it reverses? What if we set our first target near or equal to the initial risk taken? This target should be set within meaningful technical bounds so that nothing prevents the setup from playing out aside from natural market forces. With this approach, we are trading with multiple objectives. That first target is to simply reduce the risk with the trade. A big emotional weight will be lifted when you book this allotment. To further lift the haze of fear and greed, we can trail the stop on the remaining portion of the position. Now, with the remaining half of the position, you can ‘let your profits run.’ If you initially entered a trade with the belief that it would force a medium-term breakout; and you just took half profit and curbed your risk. You can now wait for that move to happen with a cool head. For the second half, it is important not to just let it drift. Have a target level or wait for momentum to turn against your position (the end of or pause in a trend).\nThis further leads us to consider: how long should all of this take? Too few people actually consider when they go into a trade that it should take X-number of minutes, hours or days. Typically, they wait until their patience is tested; and that is when their good trading habits start to break down. A simple way to establish how long a trade should take is to first consider what time frame you are looking at your charts or fundamental developments. If you are waiting for global economic activity to accelerate, then you are talking about a broad driver that can take weeks or months. If you are looking at a range and potential breakout candidate on a daily chart that has taken three weeks to develop, allow for at least a couple days. If you have watched a repeatable pattern develop on a five minute chart; your scalp should develop over approximately the same time as the previous pattern. And, what should you do after your time is up? Exit. Don’t think twice. Just exit the trade and reassess when that pair will once again be a good long or short.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T22:39:56Z","url":"http://www.thebull.com.au/experts/a/14344-how-do-i-know-when-i-should-exit-a-trade.html"}
{"text":"Facebook's new Home software on Android means still more ways to interact with people whom you're not actually with at the time. Is that always a good thing?\nIf you're one of the people who get Facebook's new Home software, your social-media life will be front and center whenever you pick up your phone. It's literally putting Facebook in your face.\nWhile that may have appeal to heavy-duty Facebook users who want to be in constant touch with their social graph, it raises some issues about \"presence.\" People have their phones with them almost all the time, including when they're interacting with friends, family, and work colleagues, and many of us (myself included) have a habit of paying attention to our phones when, perhaps, we should be paying attention to the people around us.\nFacebook isn't creating any new problems with this software, but it is making it even easier to be distracted. For some that's not a problem. For others it's a small problem, and for some -- including people who may have some some deeper issues like Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), it can be a major issue. And though it has yet to be officially recognized in the United States, there are Asian countries that recognize a condition that's being called \"Internet Addiction Disorder.\"\nTo find out more, I spoke with three experts: Dr. Jeff Szymanski, a clinical psychologist and executive director of the International OCD Foundation, Robin Maier, a Tampa-based Licensed Clinical Social Worker, who has blogged about ADD and texting, and Dr. Michael Rich, the director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children's Hospital (scroll down for podcast interview).\nI asked each of them to help me understand where to draw the line between normal, though perhaps sometimes annoying, use of technology and when it becomes a serious problem. All three used the traditional definition of addiction: when it interferes with family life, work, or achieving your goals. Szymanski made the distinction of when constant attention to a phone might be necessary versus when it's not. \"If a sports editor checks scores several times a day, it might make sense,\" he said. But if it's not a job requirement and you do it so often that it \"interferes with your work, your relationships, and your day-to-day functioning,\" it could be an unhealthy compulsive behavior. Maier worries that people \"on the ADD spectrum who find it harder to stay focused\" could easily be distracted by their phones to the point that \"it affects their personal relationships.\"\nDr. Rich asks people to think about whether they're using their device \"more and more all the time in order to get the same level of satisfaction,\" whether they \"start to experience negative symptoms\" when they're away from it, and whether they're willing \"to take on negative consequences such as your wife being angry with you or your colleagues being annoyed with you in order to maintain that habit.\"\nDisclosure: Larry Magid is co-director of ConnectSafely.org, a nonprofit Internet-safety organization that receives financial support from Facebook.\nClick below to listen to podcast interview with Dr. Rich.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T00:05:04Z","url":"https://www.cnet.com/news/does-facebooks-new-home-put-too-much-facebook-in-your-face-podcast/"}

{"text":"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has begun uranium enrichment at a new underground site well protected from possible airstrikes, a leading hardline newspaper reported Sunday.\nKayhan daily, which is close to Iran's ruling clerics, said Tehran has begun injecting uranium gas into sophisticated centrifuges at the Fordo facility near the holy city of Qom.\nUranium enrichment lies at the heart of Iran's dispute with the West. The technology can be used to produce nuclear fuel, but also materials for atomic bombs.\nThe U.S. and other countries accuse Iran of developing weapons, but Tehran says it only seeks reactors for energy and research, and refuses to halt its uranium enrichment activities.\n\"Kayhan received reports yesterday that show Iran has begun uranium enrichment at the Fordo facility amid heightened foreign enemy threats,\" the paper said in a front-page report. Kayhan's manager is a representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nBut Iran's nuclear chief Fereidoun Abbasi said late Saturday that his country will \"soon\" begin enrichment at Fordo. It was impossible to immediately reconcile the two reports.\nIran has a major uranium enrichment facility in Natanz in central Iran where nearly 8,000 centrifuges are operating. Tehran began enrichment at Natanz in April 2006.\nThe Fordo centrifuges however are reportedly more efficient, and the site better shielded from aerial attack.\nBoth the U.S. and Israel have not ruled out a military strike should Iran continue with its program.\nTehran however says it needs its enrichment program to produce fuel for future nuclear reactors and medical radioisotopes needed for cancer patients.\nThe country has been enriching uranium to less than 5 percent for years, but it began to further enrich part of its uranium stockpile to nearly 20 percent as of February 2010, saying it needs the higher grade material to produce fuel for a Tehran reactor that makes medical radioisotopes needed for cancer patients. Weapons-grade uranium is usually about 90 percent enriched.\nIran says the higher enrichment activities — of nearly 20 percent — will be carried out at Fordo. These operations are of particular concern to the West because uranium at 20 percent enrichment can be converted into fissile material for a nuclear warhead much more quickly than that at 3.5 percent.\nBuried under 300 feet (90 meters) of rock, the facility is a hardened tunnel and is protected by air defense missile batteries and the Revolutionary Guard, Iran's most powerful military force. The site is located about 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Qom, the religious nerve center of Iran's ruling system.\n\"The Fordo facility, like Natanz, has been designed and built underground. The enemy doesn't have the ability to damage it,\" the semiofficial Mehr news agency quoted Abbasi as saying Sunday.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T00:33:20Z","url":"https://www.newsmax.com/finance/pendergraft/option-traders-optimistic/2012/01/24/id/425287/"}

{"text":"Jofi Joseph: anonymous @natsecwonk handle revealed to be National Security Council staffers.\nTwitter bird says: Don’t be stupid.\n“Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Wiener? Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein” tweeted @natsecwonk, a popular anonymous tweeter who was revealed by the Daily Beast this week to be senior National Security Council staffer Jofi Joseph. In an ironic turn, Joseph has now suffered the same fate as his once-Twitter target Wiener: losing a high-profile political position due to reckless tweeting.\nWhat sets Joseph apart from the majority of people who lose their jobs by way of social media is that he took pains to anonymize his online activity. Twitter, unlike Facebook and Google+, does not require users to create accounts under their own names. Many Twitter users—including Anthony Weiner—do link their accounts to their real-life identities, but others do not, leading to a wide variety of anonymous novelty accounts and humorous parody accounts for famous people. And as Joseph’s story reminds us, Twitter is not just a place where anonymous everyday people can take on the voice of famous individuals. It’s also a place where powerful and high-profile figures can take on the voice of anonymous, uninhibited handles.\nBut social media identities are rarely completely anonymous, even when they are not governed by real name policies. Online activity almost always leaves a trail. Part of that trail is technical—companies like Twitter and Facebook log IP addresses and other data associated with user logins, which courts can compel them to turn over in certain cases—but it’s not clear that the Joseph investigation relied on any such technical tracing via Twitter’s internal records.\nReading through Joseph’s tweets, it’s not hard to imagine how a careful analysis of whom he discussed and what he talked about might be enough to let investigators deduce his true identity. His tweets read almost like a trail of breadcrumbs, dropping clues about whom the author worked with, what events he attended, what issues he followed. An investigation into Joseph’s travel and shopping patterns might mean trying to geo-locate IP addresses used to access the Twitter account at certain times and then matching that location data to places where Joseph was known to be shopping and traveling. But the fact that these patterns were “parsed” from the corpus of tweets suggests the investigation may instead have involved mining the text of the thousands of tweets posted from the now-deleted account to identify specific stores, restaurants, or destinations that Joseph visited. Or perhaps the timing of the tweet postings was analyzed and compared against Joseph’s known patterns of behavior and daily schedules. Piecing together these types of behavioral data may not be easy—the investigation into @natsecwonk’s identity apparently lasted months—but it’s far from impossible.\nTechnical clues are only part of the identity trail we create on social media sites. The ways in which our behavior and relationships on Facebook and Twitter mirror and intersect with our real-life behavior and relationships can provide equally powerful clues about who we really are. In some cases these social hints may be even more significant than technical traces—after all, an IP address can be spoofed, but an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the White House national security operation is harder to fake.\nJoseph intended to pen one of the entertaining, satirical commentary accounts that Twitter has become famous for—accounts like @justin_buber, @notzuckerberg, @queen_uk, or @PimpBillClinton—but he ended up in the middle of a career-ending debacle instead. Sure, he kept the account running for more than two years, but ultimately he ran into the fundamental problem of trying to remain anonymous in an online social world where—much like in Washington, D.C.—the whole point is to network, to connect with other people, to know and be known.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T07:00:13Z","url":"https://slate.com/technology/2013/10/jofi-joseph-anonymous-natsecwonk-handle-revealed-to-be-national-security-council-staffers.html"}
{"text":"The mayor tried to rush through a complicated proposal that caught too many Kansas City leaders by surprise. James enthusiastically presented his broad outline to the Kansas City Council with the hope of getting his proposal on the November ballot. He was met with immediate rebukes from several council members. The City Council’s mixed response was soon followed by slings and arrows from other community leaders and organizations who had serious reservations about the details.\nLost in all the politics and skepticism was the sad fact that only about one-third of 4-year-old children in Kansas City attend pre-K programs. The mayor sees a way to remedy that void. James has proposed a three-eighths-cent sales tax to generate $30 million annually for a citywide pre-K program.\nJames and his staff have studied preschool initiatives in several major cities. Denver’s successful plan was a model for the mayor’s proposal. It’s critical to bring key leaders from Denver to Kansas City to provide a full-blown, detailed presentation with open discussion involving as many stakeholders as possible.\nThis time, James needs broad-based participation. The City Council should provide input in the earliest stages. The 15 superintendents and school boards of districts that include Kansas City can provide the perspectives of educators whose students will benefit from this effort. Leadership from the Urban League of Greater Kansas City is a critical component. The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce — which is a booster, if not a true partner in this effort — will almost certainly take a leadership role, along with the mayor.\nThe details need to be hammered out right now. It will take until year’s end to weave together a proposal that the community and local leaders will support. Since James wants to put this on the ballot in April, through a citizen petition, that effort needs to start in early January so that the campaign can quickly get underway. It will take three months to run a decent campaign.\nFortunately, Kansas City has a visionary mayor to lead the charge for this visionary idea. But a lot more work and planning need to take place before it goes to Kansas City voters in April. Already the mayor has provided a rough blueprint for success. But more consensus is needed, or this worthy proposal will be nitpicked to death.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T23:18:25Z","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-rose/article218434885.html"}
{"text":"BARBARAELLEN KOCH PHOTO | Paumanok Vineyard winemaker Kareem Massoud.\nKareem Massoud has been the winemaker at the family-owned Paumanok Vineyards since 2001.\nPaumanok has been an estate winery since 1990, when Ursula and Charles Massoud renovated and re-built a turn-of-the-century potato barn.\n“I’m a second generation, homegrown winemaker. I learned the trade under my father’s tutelage,” Mr. Massoud said.\nHis father, Charles Massoud, is still a big part of making the wine at Paumanok, though the day-to-day responsibilities are Kareem Massoud’s, he said.\nAnd now the eldest son at Paumanok has a big feather to stick in his winemaking cap.\nRecently, Paumanok’s 2010 Semi-Dry Riesling was chosen as one of the Wall Street Journal’s “luxury dozen,” the top 12 bottles of wine in the nation chosen in an 800-bottle blind judging, chaired by British author and world-renowned wine writer, Hugh Johnson.\nBecause of 2010’s exceptionally dry and warm season, Paumanok’s riesling was picked a week or two earlier than normal — in mid-September, Mr. Massoud said. The semi-dry vintage was blended from the estate’s four separate riesling blocks, roughly 16 acres, he said.\n“We have one block that was planted in 1983, two from the late 80s, and the most recent from ’05,” he said. The harvested blocks were fermented separately and later blended together. The process also included a mixture of different yeasts.\n“The wine didn’t touch oak at all,” Mr. Massoud said. “It was fermented entirely in stainless steel tanks and given two or three months contact with the lees — relatively brief lees aging, where the wine is still in contact with the dead yeast cells that have settled at the bottom of the tank.” This method could add texture and volume to the wine, he said.\n“The key thing to note about this wine is that we call it semi-dry, meaning there’s residual sugars in the wine,” he said, adding the wine has about 3 percent residual sugar, or 30 grams per liter, and about 8 and a half grams of acid per liter.\nThe first riesling the vineyard produced was its 1990 Dry Riesling. The vineyard began producing semi-dry riesling two years later.\nWhen asked what qualifications it takes to be a winemaker, Mr. Massoud said a degree is not among them.\n“I think I’m living proof that you don’t need an oenology or viticulture degree to be a winemaker, though that certainly doesn’t hurt.” He said that if you have the right attitude, perseverance and a strong work ethic, you can do whatever you want to do in life, including winemaking. He added the job is also very demanding.\nSome say Paumanok’s honor as one of the Wall Street Journal’s “luxury dozen” has put the Long Island region on the fine wine map, but Mr. Massoud said the region has already been on the map.\n“This can only help bolster the perception that Long Island is a legitimate wine district that serious wine connoisseurs around the world should be familiarizing themselves with,” he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T10:40:01Z","url":"https://riverheadnewsreview.timesreview.com/tag/wine-press/"}

It's good to see the practice of massively overselling capacity is alive and well.\nAnd am I the only one who thinks even 2Mb/s will be virtually useless by the time this is launched? With the massive increase in size (and thus bandwidth) used by most websites in recent years, even 2Mb/s will look like dial-up speed for anything other than email. I'm sure some people in rural areas (or for whatever reason can't get high-speed Internet through other means) will be happy to wait 10-20 seconds for each page to load, but most others will probably think it's not worth the cost they'll have to pay for it.\noh well there goes the PLANET!!!\nSunday 7th December 2008 11:59 GMT yeah, right.\norbit? Fact checker, aisle 3.\nIt's unlikely to be \"in orbit over North America\". More likely to be \"in orbit over Ecuador\", or some other place on the equator. That is, after all, where geosynchronous orbits need to be.\nWhat about the police radar?\nIsn't this the same band that the police radar use. My Valentine 1 is going to go nuts.!!!\nSatellite is Good for Broadcast.\nI'm sceptical about these Ka Internet business plans due to the 800ms Latency and extra rain fade on Ka.\n2 Million people on 100GBps is indeed 50kbps per person. At 50:1 contention, it's 2.5Mbps.\nBut that is Clear Sky. It uses adaptive modulation on up and down links and in heavy rain will give 200kbps at 50:1 contention on downlink.\nUplinks are about 1/8th speed at best. Users want more like 4:1, 5Mbps and <50ms latency for VOIP and Gaming.\nUnless you use the flavour of VPN that viasat supports natively on their modem you lose all the TCP/IP accelerator features. As is the case for encrypted Torrents.\nSimilar Ka is launching in Europe @13E in similar Time Frame. US already has similar \"Wild Blue\".\nIn the end these may make satellite TV cheaper. Sat TV can't use the ACM on downlink, but needs CCM, so speed is the same (and lower) in Clear Sky and Rain.\nok not so good for games, passable for IM, though obviously not ideal, but for stuff like p2p, or anything like email or general web surfing its probably fine.\ndepends on the price they charge. if they offer it as \"unfiltered, limited only by bandwidth\" i.e. no specific throttling but when its full it slows down. it may fly.\nespecially if the link kit to upload/download is a black box on an ethernet wire (or wifi) thats easy to set up. make it need a phone line for the uplink and its dead in the water. if you have a phone line you don't need it.\nit comes down to price. slow but cheap? or no bandwidth caps but slow? or seriously fast, cheap but limited and they may have a chance.\nlimit it in any serious way, or have the connection kit seriously expensive and its dead.\nWeb browsing is horrible over satellite connections, particularly bi-directional satellite. The amount of data isn't huge, but its lots of itty bitty files which generates lots of individual TCP connections that never get going very quickly due to the high latency and small window sizes.\nI used to maintain an ISP satellite service in the 90's and the only way we could improve the performance of web browsing was to proxy HTTP and break some RFCs to keep TCP window sizes big. Even doing that, some commercial apps still used to run far better over ISDN or even analogue dial..","timestamp":"2019-04-20T23:34:23Z","url":"https://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/all/2008/12/06/viasat_1_launch_contract_arianespace/"}
{"text":"How critical can one be of Israel? It is a question that Germany has been debating since SPIEGEL ONLINE columnist Jakob Augstein was included on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of the world's worst anti-Semites. Political leaders in Berlin have a different answer than Germans at large.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has charted a firmly pro-Israeli course.\nDoes Angela Merkel mistrust the very people she governs? Is she uncomfortable with the German people?\nIn October 2011, the German chancellor stood onstage at the academy of the Jewish Museum, in Berlin, next to conductor Daniel Barenboim. The celebratory concert had concluded, and the museum's director had just presented Merkel with its Award for Understanding and Tolerance.\nThis is one of many awards the chancellor has received from Jewish institutions over the last couple years, including the Heinz Galinski Prize from the Jewish Community of Berlin, the American Jewish Committee's Light Unto the Nations Award and an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University.\nAt the Jewish Museum, Merkel spoke a few pleasant words, calling the award both an honor and a responsibility. Then she cited a study, according to which 60 percent of Europeans -- including Germans -- consider Israel the most significant threat to world peace.\nFollowing Merkel's logic seems to present a conclusion that two thirds of Germans harbor anti-Semitic sentiments. Is this really what the chancellor believes? Or was her intention simply, as she said in her speech, to warn against allowing anti-Semitism to increase?\nMerkel's speech provides a direct path into the minefield that is relations between Jews and Germans, and between Germany and Israel. Of course it is absurd to label Israel the world's worst aggressor. But does simply making such a statement count as anti-Semitism? Where does objective criticism end and defamation begin? The controversy over journalist Jakob Augstein's columns in SPIEGEL ONLINE and elsewhere has re-ignited this debate, a storm triggered when the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles placed Augstein on its list of the world's worst anti-Semites.\nTwo different arenas of discussion have arisen in Germany in recent years, one for the country's politicians and one for the public. Most politicians cling tightly and fearfully to the safety of the official line when they give speeches. Particularly members of the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, haven't forgotten the 1988 case of Philipp Jenninger. Then president of the Bundestag, Jenninger expressed himself unclearly in a commemorative speech on the anniversary of the Nazi Kristallnacht pogroms in 1938, leaving his own views too open to interpretation. Within 24 hours of that speech, Jenninger resigned.\nThe general public, on the other hand, is tired of the strictures that dictate what can and cannot be said for the sake of maintaining good German-Israeli relations.\nEvery society needs its taboos, of course. In Germany, Holocaust denial is one such taboo, as is casting aspersions on Israel's right to exist. But doesn't each era need to find its own particular language in which to communicate? World War II has been over for more than six decades. The generation that perpetrated the crimes is dying out. Germany has become one of Israel's closest allies, as can be seen from the billions of euros' worth of arms sales from Germany to Israel. Isn't that grounds enough for speaking openly, even expressing severe criticism if necessary?\nThe chancellor certainly doesn't think so. More than any other head of government, she has aligned Germany with Israel. Some see these efforts toward reconciliation with the Jewish people as the only conviction the chancellor truly holds. \"She takes the matter personally,\" says Deidre Berger, head of the Berlin office of the American Jewish Committee. Shimon Stein, former Israeli ambassador to Germany, was even a private guest at Merkel's weekend house in the Uckermark region northeast of Berlin.\nIn a 2008 address to the Knesset, Merkel declared Israel's security \"part of my country's raison d'être.\" Even more spectacular was the statement that followed: \"And if that is so, then these cannot be allowed to remain empty words at a critical time.\" This can only be understood as Merkel assuring Israel that Germany will step in with military aid if necessary.\n\"A German politician must establish a relationship of mutual trust with Israel, so that criticism of Jerusalem is not misunderstood,\" says Ruprecht Polenz, a member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and chair of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Bundestag. Chancellor Merkel has certainly done this. But she has also offered at most quiet protest over Israel's settlement policy, to little effect. Many within the Chancellery are frustrated that these arguments have not moved Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the least.\nMerkel's unconditional solidarity with Israel has thus failed to pay off, yet at the same time her approach has distanced the chancellor from many Germans, who are unwilling to follow her so unconditionally. Just how wide that rift has grown could be seen in the public debate last spring over a poem by Günter Grass, in which the author portrayed Israel as the aggressor in the Middle East and a threat to world peace. None of the country's top politicians came to Grass' defense. Hermann Gröhe, secretary general of the CDU, said he was \"appalled\" by the poem and even Sigmar Gabriel, chair of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) stated, \"Some of it is excessive, and in many parts hysterical.\" These reactions only made the public's support for Grass all the more vehement, with letters piling up in the parties' headquarters expressing outrage over the politicians' rebuke of Grass.\nWhat exactly does this response signify? Are the Germans a nation of anti-Semites, with the ugly countenance of hatred toward Jews lurking behind every corner, as author Tuvia Tenenbom recently suggested in his book \"I Sleep in Hitler's Room: An American Jew Visits Germany\"?\nThere have been a number of studies on anti-Semitism in Germany, and few topics have been examined as extensively as Germans' sentiments toward Jews. The most recent major study, conducted on behalf of the Federal Interior Ministry, clocks in at 204 pages.\nStill, the question remains: How can one measure an attitude, a feeling? In what units is hate calculated? Is someone an anti-Semite if they say Jews have too much influence in Germany? Or if they express agreement with the opinion that Jews never look after anyone but themselves and their own?\nOne thing can be said for certain, and that is that Germany falls more to the middle of the spectrum on such questions. In Poland and Hungary, for example, anti-Jewish sentiment is far more widespread than in Germany. All told, according to the Interior Ministry study, 20 percent of Germans harbor latent anti-Semitism.\nCertainly these numbers should be taken with a degree of skepticism. The researchers themselves admit it's impossible to produce clearly measured results in this field. But one thing is clear: Germans' anti-Semitism acts as a great temptation in politics -- any politician looking to garner votes for his or her party quickly can play on anti-Jewish sentiment.\nThat, though, is a dangerous game, as politician Martin Hohmann found out when he used the term \"a nation of perpetrators\" in connection with Jews. Merkel excluded him from the CDU's parliamentary group as a result.\nThe story of Jürgen W. Möllemann ended badly as well. Möllemann, a top politician in the Free Democratic Party (FDP), played a game that held not only many voters in thrall, but his own party as well, stating in an interview that he could sympathize with Palestinian suicide attackers, and accusing then-Vice President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany Michel Friedman of being \"intolerant and spiteful.\"\nFDP party head Guido Westerwelle was slow to take any action on Möllemann. Not until Hans-Dietrich Genscher and the party's higher-ups intervened did Westerwelle break with Möllemann. Israel hasn't forgotten the incident and keeps Westerwelle, now Germany's foreign minister, under close observation to this day because of the Möllemann affair.\nIsrael feels under threat more than ever before, both from Iran and through the developments throughout the Arab world, and that sensitivity is only growing. At the same time, from Germany's perspective there are many reasons to view Israeli policies critically. The country has changed, with demographic changes due to immigration from Eastern Europe and Africa causing a political shift to the right. Hardliners will have the say here for the foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, Israel's settlement policy will soon render the idea of a Palestinian state impossible. When Hans-Ulrich Klose, the SPD's top politician on foreign policy issues, recently attended a political congress in Israel, he met hardly any politicians still working for a two-state solution -- the solution Germany considers the only viable path to peace in the Middle East. \"It was sobering,\" Klose stated.\nWhat, then, should Germany do? Klose says he still believes the German government should refrain from publicly reprimanding Israel. \"Why should Germany of all countries make itself Israel's critic?\" he asks.\nBut some younger politicians take a different view, and are increasingly unwilling to stick to the old approach. \"Germany has a historical responsibility,\" agrees Julia Klöckner, 40, head of the CDU in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. \"But that's not a blank check to be uncritical in foreign policy.\"\nGermany needs to find a way to be less inhibited in its dealings with Israel, Klöckner suggests. She adds, \"Those who throw around accusations of anti-Semitism at every turn lose credibility.\"\n\"Less inhibited in dealings with Israel\"? \"Throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism\"? Are these acceptable things to say? Klöckner may find herself taking considerable heat for her statements -- or meeting with considerable approval.\nIsrael doesn't care whether Germany endorses the policy of building settlements in what would become Palestine or not. If it doesn't care what the USA thinks, then sadly it certainly won't care what Germany thinks. Germany's role, for many years to come, will be to support Israel when it can, and to keep quiet when it can't. This may not be fair, or rational, but it is a consequence of history, and it is the only honourable course of action that remains for Germany at this time. It is to the great credit of Germany that most its people recognize this reality and are prepared to abide by it. Despite all of the sophistication of international relations, relationships between countries are not so different from relationships between individuals. Wrongs must be righted, and the duration of righting far outlasts the duration of the wronging, and most Germans, even young Germans, know this and accept this, and it honourable and commendable that they do so.\nI could not agree more with clockwatchr. Germany's role, for many years to come, will be (or at least should be) to support Israel when it can.....and to remain quiet when it cannot. As this poster stated, it is a consequence of history! I am a supporter of Germany and its people. But, c'mon, if there is ever to be any criticism of the policies of the Israel govt, it should be left up to other European governments. Some people may think 6 decades (since the Holocaust) is a long time. But in the course of history, it really is not! Yes, indeed, there have been many other atrocities throughout history. But what happened in WWII can NEVER be forgotten. And it is beyond despicable. Sadly, history shows us that it is a consequence of what can happen when a society does not make themselves aware of what is going on around them.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T11:01:23Z","url":"https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-debates-the-meaning-of-anti-semitism-a-877414.html"}

{"text":"ZURICH, April 10 (Reuters) - Sunrise Communications' top shareholder on Wednesday blocked plans to extend the company's right to issue fresh capital to 2021, complicating its bid to buy Liberty Global's Swiss UPC cable business for $6.3 billion.\nThe rejection by Freenet at the Swiss telecoms firm's annual shareholder meeting does not scupper the takeover, which was announced in February.\nA separate meeting will decide on the $4.1 billion capital increase needed to push that through.\nBut the thumbs-down from German telecoms company Freenet, which holds a 24.5 percent stake, denied Sunrise the required two-thirds majority to extend capacity for authorised capital until 2021. The measure got only 59.3 percent support.\n\"Together with Freenet we could have agreed it makes sense by pushing forward a (further potential) capital increase to take pressure off the large capital increase,\" Sunrise finance chief Andre Krause told Reuters.\n\"Now we can't do that. Freenet robbed us of optionality.\"\nFreenet had already said it would not take part in the main capital hike, saying it was disturbed by how the transaction was structured. It has not yet decided how to vote at the extraordinary shareholder meeting that will be convened to approve that, Freenet lawyer Alexander Borgwardt told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting.\nThe date for that meeting - where only a simple majority is needed - has yet to be set pending regulatory approval for the deal.\nAuthorising fresh capital now could have helped contribute some of the money needed for the deal, Borgwardt said, adding: \"We think this should be voted on at the end, when the entire transaction will be discussed.\"\nSunrise Chairman Peter Kurer said a two-thirds majority for the capital increase could be needed should Liberty Global in the meantime buy shares in Sunrise.\nIn that case, it would be easier for Freenet with its nearly one-quarter stake to block the capital increase because not all shareholders attend meetings. The turnout on Wednesday, for instance, was 62 percent of the voting capital.\nThere was no evidence at this stage that Liberty planned such a move, Krause said.\nKurer had earlier expressed optimism that Sunrise would win backing to raise the money needed to complete the UPC takeover.\nSunrise officials have met more than 170 large shareholders and potential investors in recent weeks to outline the deal. \"After these talks they view the transaction significantly more positively,\" he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T14:09:18Z","url":"https://cn.reuters.com/article/liberty-global-ma-sunrise-comm-grp-idCNL8N21S3BY"}

The Facebook account of Vita, who is a member of that community, responded with expletives and derisive comments about Zohny’s hijab.\nCondemnation from the community was swift, and Town Supervisor Rich Schaffer was alerted. Schaffer said that as of Friday Vita was suspended for 30 days without pay from his job as a heavy equipment operator in the Department of Public Works.

Bina applies big data analytics to genomics, making it possible to sequence the human genome in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks.\nToday, Bina launched its commercial product. The platform provides physicians, clinicians, and researchers with a detailed picture of a patient’s health. From there, they can make data-driven diagnoses and prescribe individualized courses of treatment.\nThere are thousands of genetic disorders. In 2013, over 580,000 Americans are expected to die of cancer. One in 20 babies born in the U.S. is admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit, and 20 percent of infant deaths result from congenital or chromosomal defects. Technology can be used to curb these terrifying trends. Bina’s role is to bridge the gap between DNA sequencing technology and the diagnosticians and clinicians who can apply it to their practice.\nAsadi said her team had to achieve innovations in every step of genetic processing in order to create a scaleable, marketable, effective solution. Bina’s platform includes a hardware box to collect DNA, advanced software to process the data, and applications to turn the data into actionable form. Whereas before a full genetic analysis took weeks or months and could cost thousands of dollars, Bina turns it around within hours for around $200 a sample.\nThe technology emerged out of Asadi’s PhD work at Stanford. She collaborated with professors from around the world to apply high performance computing and computer architecture to gain a new understanding of human health and disease. Bina was founded in 2011 by three professors from the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford. It is backed by venture funding, and pilot customers include the Stanford Genetics Department and Palo Alto Veteran Affairs Hospital.\nStartups don’t often set out to cure cancer or prevent infant mortality. However, as technology continues to evolve and along with it, the healthcare industry, a medical system where diagnoses and treatments are based on hard data, where each and every individual is treated as such, could be on the horizon.\nRead a VentureBeat guest post by Dr. Asadi: The personalized medicine revolution is almost here.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T08:19:52Z","url":"https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/19/using-big-data-to-cure-cancer-bina-ushers-in-new-era-of-medicine/"}

{"text":"I thought we were a Tree City and tried to protect all our trees.\nI have heard that a house in Flintridge with two magnificent old oak trees just sold. The oak tree in the front is being retained, but the gorgeous one in the back is being considered for removal so the new owners can build another huge home.\nThe city can’t let this happen. That tree is healthy and should be protected. I learned that Miller Tree Service has been servicing that tree for years. I hope the city has contacted them about the health of the tree and will make sure the new owners do not get rid of the tree.\nAlso when such trees are destroyed, shouldn’t the fees be much more than just $10,800 to remove an unwanted protected tree that’s 36 inches or greater in diameter? This provision was written some years ago and now people think nothing of paying the fine and being able to just build where they want. We need these trees to give beauty to our city, shade to everyone and to save the environment!\nWe are so fortunate to have these beautiful trees here in La Cañada Flintridge.

{"text":"Who is Sherlock Holmes? Such is the question posed this summer by Jeffrey Hatcher’s play Holmes and Watson, the final production of the Alley Theatre’s 17-18 season, but it’s also the mystery unraveled within the International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.\nFans have been obsessed with the enigmatic detective since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first set him deerstalking into the world’s collective imagination 130 years ago. In film and television, he and his many contemporary incarnations are more popular than ever. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Houston is getting a cool summer of Sherlock.\nBut who is Sherlock Holmes and why do we in Houston continue to love him so? This was the mystery I set out to solve with a day devoted to murder, mayhem, and the master detective, ever ready to put the world to right.\nFirst up, I headed over the Museum District to discover the very dramatic HMNS exhibition unexpectedly had something of an immersive theater feel. Before entering I received a casebook I would need to use along my journey into the dark underbelly of Victorian crime fiction.\nThis HMNS exhibition contains manuscripts and artifacts of Doyle’s era which delve into the history of Holmes and give insights into Doyle’s influences, including the writings of Edgar Allen Poe and Doyle’s his real life medical training and studies under Dr. Joseph Bell. The majority of the galleries are organized around a new Holmes mystery, written by noted Doyle biographer Daniel Stashower. The guiding narrative invites visitors to help Holmes solve this latest diabolical case.\nAt times working my way through the exhibition did feel as if I had entered into a role playing theatrical piece. The casebook and displays invited me to attempt some observational exercises, documenting all I saw, solve puzzles and work through a series of problems and experiments. The layout of the galleries gives the impression that Holmes himself was always just a few steps in front of me, in the next room.\nOne of the most fun parts of the experience was watching kids, ages 5 to 65, diligently and sometimes gleefully filling out their casebooks and working through the steps to solve the mystery. Along the way, the exhibition rather sneakily teaches some Victorian history and forensic science all in the guise of putting us through an audition to become Baker Street Irregulars.\nFor fans of the latest onscreen versions of the detective, the exhibition presents several displays of props and costumes from the three most popular current incarnations of the mythology: Guy Ritchie’s steampunk Holmes films starring Robert Downey Jr., the BBC Benedict Cumberbatch Sherlock and CBS’s Elementary.\nOnce I felt my observation skills finely honed, I headed over to the Alley to see if I could out deduce Hatcher’s Sherlock, only to find that in the play, it is the good doctor who must play detective.\nHolmes and Watson, directed by Mark Shanahan, begins three years after the notorious Reichenbach Falls case, when Holmes and his archenemy Moriarty fell to their deaths. Or did they?\nDr. Watson (Jeremy Webb) is invited to a mysterious island asylum by a seemingly concerned, but perplexed Dr. Evans (Bruce Warren). Three inmates (Jay Sullivan, Dan Domingues, and Chris Hutchison) housed there all claim to be Sherlock Holmes. They all have a different story to tell about what happened that fateful night on the Falls and very different motives for telling their tales to Holmes’s best friend, confidant, and biographer. In turn, Watson must discover who is the real Sherlock Holmes, as danger lurks in every night shadow.\nOf course, one of the allures of a good mystery, especially a Holmes play, is seeing if we can keep up with the game and figure out who done it, or in this case who is who, before a Sherlock or Watson explains it all.\nIn only 90 minutes, Hatcher, director Shanahan, and the cast create enough quick plot turns that audiences members might find themselves dizzy at the final reveals. Near the end, I did want to give my (imaginary) Baker Street Irregular badge a congratulatory polish because I did spot a few, though not all, of those plot twists leading up to the finale.\nWhether I half-solved the case thanks to the training the International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes gave me earlier in the day, or it was the years of watching and reading so many versions of the great detective that made me a successful plot sleuth, who, but Holmes, can know.\nHolmes and Watson runs at the Alley Theatre through July 22. The HMNS presents the ticketed International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes through September 30.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T12:56:52Z","url":"http://houston.culturemap.com/news/arts/07-02-18-sherlock-holmes-houston-museum-of-natural-science-alley-theatre/"}

Originally from Bosnia, the Cetics also lived in Croatia and Serbia, moving around as they endured the brutal conflict known as the Bosnian War (1992-1995), which claimed over 100,000 lives and created over a million refugees like the Cetics.\nFollowing the war, they relocated to the United States with the help of the local International Rescue Committee. In early 2009, they opened the Balkan Bakery on Water Street, serving up things like traditional Meat Pie (Burek) and Cevapcici, a kind of grilled minced-meat sandwich, and, of course, baklava. Another treat: Bosnian coffee, prepared by boiling finely ground coffee in a small, pear-shaped pot.\n\"We are going to be a full bar and restaurant now,\" says matriarch Anja Cetic, \"offering American and European cuisine– what I like to call food from the heart with an accent.\"\nThe bakery items will be the same, says Cetic, like the baklava, Mascarpone cake, and cookies and baked walnut bread. But now they'll be serving lunch and dinner Tuesday through Friday, brunch and dinner on Saturday, and brunch on Sunday. In addition to homemade sausages, kielbasa, panini sandwiches, and salads, Cetic says they will also be offering beer from Croatia, Slovenia, and Russia.\n\"We're the only restaurant in Charlottesville serving these beers,\" says Cetic, \"and the only one making their own kielbasa, hamburger patties, and sausages in-house.\"\nSounds delicious. Thanks for the heads-up. Will check them out very soon.\nWe went to a Balkan Bistro and bar for dinner and a drink which was former Balkan Bakery, the service was great and food was delicious. They also have Croatian, Russian, Slovenian, Bulgarian and domestic beers. Bud light was only $2.50 per glass amazing… I will be going there every day.\nThis place is amazing, the owners work so hard they use local vegetables and local meats, and also they are on the Farmers market on Saturday with delicious desserts.\nFresh ingredients but. Always creative and fun and great service.\nBrunch is a comfortable, solicitous and delicious experience here.\nMe and my bit@$ are gonna hop in the coop and hit that joint tonite son.\nIf my girl get the lobster you know what happens next son.\nSounds great and I look forward to patronizing this business.\nBut does this mean no more guys in track-suits talking Slavic noisily on their cellphones at the Barracks' Rd Greenberry's?\n\"If my girl get the lobster you know what happens next son.\"\nYOU GET THE CRABS! HA HA HA AHA HAHH HAHH HA HAH AHH HA!!!!!\nThis was truly an outstanding dining experience that could have been in a Bistro in Paris, but happens to be in Charlottesville. Each dish was beautifully presented, delectaible and interesting in every way. It is rare to enjoy all the dishes my husband and I order but we both did and cleaned our plates. We did find room for sumptuous desserts, worth every calorie in them. We certainly will dine there on our next visit to Charlottesville.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T15:43:20Z","url":"http://www.readthehook.com/98605/balkan-bistro-and-bar"}

{"text":"Star Washington Wizards guard Gilbert Arenas, 28, appeared in the D.C. Superior Court to be sentenced for the gun crime he admitted to in January. He has been spared a jail term.\nWashington Wizards guard Gilbert Arenas pleaded guilty Friday in D.C. Superior Court to a felony count of carrying a pistol without a license, leaving his NBA career in jeopardy.\nAs part of a plea deal, prosecutors agreed not to ask for more than six months in jail for Arenas. He will remain free at least until he is sentenced on March 26 by Superior Court Judge Robert E. Morin.\nMorin is not bound by the plea agreement -- a fact he emphasized in court -- and could sentence Arenas to anywhere from probation to a maximum five years in jail. The former all-star was released after agreeing to surrender his passport and not possess any handguns.\nArenas, 28, has been the face of the Wizards since he arrived in Washington in 2003. He has four years remaining on his six-year, $111 million contract, but the NBA has suspended him indefinitely and the team has not publicly supported its star since the gun incident. On Friday, the team issued a terse statement saying officials were disappointed in Arenas. \"Gilbert used extremely poor judgment and is ultimately responsible for his own actions,\" the statement said. He likely is done playing at least for this season. Adidas announced late Friday it was ending its relationship with Arenas, whom it had sponsored since 2003.\nDuring his court appearance, Arenas showed little of the engaging personality that has made his No. 0 jersey ubiquitous at Verizon Center. He walked into the courthouse wearing a gray flannel pinstriped suit and answered questions from Morin with simple \"yes, sir\" and \"no, sir\" responses. Those questions included whether he had agreed to plead guilty and waive his right to a trial.\nThe charges stem from the now-infamous incident in the Wizards' locker room at Verizon Center on Dec. 21. At the hearing Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Kavanaugh filled in some of the details of the confrontation between Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton, without mentioning Crittenton by name.\nOn Dec. 19, the team flew on a chartered flight to the Washington area from Phoenix. Arenas and Crittenton got into an argument over a card game. Crittenton suggested a fistfight. But Arenas said he was too old to fight and instead said he would burn Crittenton's vehicle or shoot him in the face. Crittenton then told Arenas he would \"shoot the [expletive]\" out of Arenas and shoot Arenas in his surgically repaired left knee. Arenas later told Wizards employees that he was joking about the threats.\nOn Dec. 21, at about 9:30 a.m., Arenas arrived at Verizon Center for practice. He came into the locker room wearing a black backpack with a silver Smith & Wesson .500 magnum revolver inside. He then placed four guns on the chair directly in front of Crittenton's locker. Arenas wrote \"PICK 1\" on a piece of paper and placed it on Crittenton's chair near the guns. Arenas said he also was joking about that.\nWhen Crittenton saw the guns, he said, \"What is this?\"\nArenas told Crittenton, \"You said you were going to shoot me, so pick one.\" Crittenton said he did not need Arenas's guns because he had his own. Crittenton picked up one of the guns from the chair and threw it across the locker room. Crittenton then displayed his own silver-colored, semiautomatic handgun, the prosecutor said.\nAfter the incident, Arenas collected the guns, placed them inside his locker and then put them in a suitcase. He gave the suitcase to another Wizards teammate and told him to take it take it to Arenas's car in the garage. Prosecutors said there was no evidence that the teammate knew what was inside the suitcase.\nWhen the unnamed teammate went to the garage, he did not know which vehicle belonged to Arenas. So the player left the suitcase in the garage. Minutes later, Wizards management learned about the incident and met with Arenas. He admitted he brought the guns from his home in Virginia into Washington. He also told management that Crittenton had a gun.\nWizards management then told security guards to grab the suitcase and remove it from Verizon Center. Arenas led a member of the security staff to the garage and pointed out the suitcase. The security officer then took the guns back to Virginia.\nOn Dec. 24, attorneys for the Wizards and Arenas told the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District about the incident. Authorities then seized the four guns from Arenas's house in Virginia, including the .500 magnum; a .50-caliber gold-plated semiautomatic Desert Eagle with a magazine; a .45-caliber, black semiautomatic Kimber Eclipse with a magazine; and a 9mm Browning with a magazine.\nNow, Arenas must wait until March to learn his fate. Prosecutors and Arenas's lawyer will both issue sentencing recommendations to Morin. Morin will consider those requests along with a mandatory report from the court services division, which will interview Arenas and others. Arenas also must turn himself in to D.C. police by Jan. 29 to be fingerprinted and officially booked.\nHis attorney, Kenneth L. Wainstein, issued a statement saying Arenas \"accepted full responsibility for his actions.\" NBA Players Association chief Billy Hunter said in a statement that the union is \"committed to aggressively representing him.\"\nArenas could have been charged with four counts of illegal gun possession -- one for each of the pistols in the locker room. But as part of the plea agreement, he faces one charge, making it more likely that he'll avoid much jail time, the sources said. As part of the deal, prosecutors agreed not to bring any more charges.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T21:14:26Z","url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011502656.html"}

In the same period, global emerging market funds received net inflows worth $8.6 billion. This is based on data published by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research (EPFR). Citigroup’s analysts point out that the lower inflows into Asian funds have been because of large fund-raising by Asian companies: “Over the last three months, companies in Asia (ex-Japan) raised US$54 billion both through IPOs (initial public offerings) and secondary issuances, which was 3.6 times the funds raised in Latin America, Emerging Europe, Middle East and South Africa all put together.\"\nWhile this has affected short-term returns of investors in Asian emerging markets, it is a healthy trend so far as the long-term health of Asian companies goes.

{"text":"Spoiler alert: Santa Clause isn’t real—at least, according to these celebrities. For decades, the jolly, red-suited and white-bearded man has ruled the holidays and the imagination of most children under the age of 10. You know the drill: Santa rides in on his reindeer, slips in through the chimney while everyone is sleeping, and leaves his presents before exiting with a bite of milk and cookies. The story is told a million times in a person’s childhood until they learn the catastrophic truth that Santa is fictional.\nEven celebrities like Mila Kunis and Gina Rodriguez fall for the ploy. But, like most of us, they’ve lived through the deception to tell the tale. To understand how Hollywood found out about the biggest scandal to rock a third grader’s life, we rounded up stories from seven celebrities on how they learned that jolly old Saint Nicholas was a urban myth. Hear their hilarious stories, ahead.\nLike a lot of us, Mila Kunis learned that Santa wasn't real from someone at school. In an interview with BuzzFeed, the actress revealed that an elementary school classmate spoiled the news by explaining how ridiculous a flying sleigh sounded. Though, not wanting his little sister to become jaded to Christmas magic, Kunis's older brother came up with the perfect solution to buy her one more year.\nGina Rodriguez spoiled the fun herself when she snuck around on Christmas Eve to find her dad putting \"Santa's\" presents underneath the tree. Though, from the sound of her story, her parents were relieved that they didn't have to keep the jig up.\n\"I knew at 4 or 5. I was so nosey. I would look in the closets,\" Rodriguez told \"Entertainment Tonight.\" \"I would look in the presents. I would stay up, and then I was like that ain't no Santa Clause, that's my daddy! They were like 'Child, don't worry.'\"\nFrom an early age, Justin Bieber's mom was \"straight up and honest\" with him about Santa. In an interview with AOL Music, the singer revealed that his mom explained to him that Santa wasn't real when he was very young, so he didn't feel lied to and betrayed when he was older.\n\"My mom always told me there wasn't a Santa,\" Bieber said. \"This was her logic: She thought if I grew up knowing about Santa then finding out he wasn't real, that it would be like she was lying to me. And then when she told me about God, I maybe wouldn't believe her.\"\nAs an intuitive child, Nick Jonas always had an inkling in his mind that Santa wasn't real. In an interview with Music Choice, the singer revealed his skepticism when people told him that he would receive a lump of coal from Santa if he was bad.\n\"I was never given a lump of coal, thankfully,\" Jonas said. \"Also, I never really believed in Santa Clause, to be honest. I wasn't as easy trick into thinking it was real, and that I would get the lump of coal if I was bad.\"\nA lot of us can relate with Brad Pitt's feeling of \"betrayal\" when he learned that Santa wasn't real. In an interview with E! News, the actor recalled his frustration when he found out that Saint Nick was fictional.\n\"I'm not a real big on the whole Santa thing,\" Pitt said. \"I thought it was a huge act of betrayal when I was a kid. I didn't like that. When I found out the truth, I was like, 'Why, why, why would you lie to me, why?'\"\nMariah Carey is proof that there are some Santa believers out there. In an interview with BuzzFeed, the \"All I Want for Christmas\" singer outed herself as a Santa truist when she refused to fess up when she learned the holiday icon was fake.\n\"What are you talking about? Santa comes every year!” she said.\nLittle Mix member Jade Thirwall might have never known that Santa wasn't real if it wasn't for her dad's slip-up when she was a kid. In an interview with SiriusXM, the singer explained that every year her dad would dress up as Santa and put presents underneath the tree. It fooled her for a while, until one year she saw \"Santa\" wearing the same slippers her dad owned. Whoops!\n\"Dancing With the Stars\" pro Witney Carson's parents were the ones who spoiled the Santa news for her. After seeing their daughter getting bullied for believing in the holiday legend, Carson's parents broke the news that wasn't was fictional—something she didn't take very well.\n\"I think I was about 8 or 9. I was actually devastated. I just loved Santa Claus. I believed in it so much, and my dad was like 'Honey, he's not real,'\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\" \"It got to the point where people would still make fun of me at school because I still believed in Santa Claus. They're like, 'Sweetie, we have to tell you the truth because you’re getting made fun of at school.' They were like, 'He's not real,' and I was like 'No!'\"\n\"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" alum Brandi Glanville's disappointment when she learned that Santa wasn't real in ninth grade (yes—when she was a freshman in high school) is the reason she's trying to keep the magic alive for her kids as long as she can.\n\"I'm telling my kids forever that he’s real,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\" \"I was like in ninth grade [when I found out.] I was old and devastated. I learned from kids in school.\"\n\"Iron Man\" actor Paul Bettany learned that Santa was fictional when he was sleeping on Christmas Eve one night when he woke up to his drunk dad ambling around, putting presents in his stocking.\n“My drunk father [was] stumbling into my room and I woke up and I saw him stuffing stuff in my stocking and he went, ‘Ho, ho, ho,’\" he said on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"","timestamp":"2019-04-20T21:12:08Z","url":"https://stylecaster.com/how-celebrities-found-out-santa-wasnt-real/"}

{"text":"\"Don't be a \"d--- sheep,\" my father told me this so early and often in my life that I thought the word \"sheep\" started with a \"d.\" But I didn't miss the counsel that I should think for myself and not blindly follow what others, especially my peers, were doing. So I grew up without much appreciation for what it meant to be a follower – or for the value of good leaders.\nWhen I started to study Christian Science and to probe the Bible more deeply, I gained an understanding of God as a shepherd who would care for and guide His sheep. One day I came across the definition of sheep in Mary Baker Eddy's book, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\": \"Innocence; inoffensiveness; those who follow their leader\" (p. 594).\nThis gave me a new insight into the role of sheep. Being a follower didn't seem so bad if it involved the qualities of innocence and inoffensiveness. I saw that my dad's counsel was against blindly following the wrong leader, as Jesus warned: \"If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\"\nBlindness, which can mean holding so firmly to our own opinions that we can't see others' perspectives, is not good in either a follower or a leader. And since we all have opportunities to be both followers and leaders, we need to know how and when to do both.\nDoris Kearns Goodwin has written much about leaders and leadership. In her latest book, \"Team of Rivals: The political genius of Abraham Lincoln,\" she sets out much of what makes a good leader.\nIn an interview Ms. Goodwin was asked, \"What personal qualities made Lincoln such a successful leader?\" She answered in part, \"Lincoln had a quiet self-confidence that allowed him to surround himself by people better known than he was.... Lincoln also had the ability to absorb and listen well to what people were feeling and thinking. He could see both sides of the issue\" (July 6, www.forbes.com).\nWhen a situation cries out for good leadership, it also demands followers. It's obvious that humility is required to be a follower, but it takes even more humility to be an effective leader. Certainly it means dropping selfish ambition for the rewards of leadership and adopting the ambition to serve.\nThroughout the Hebrew Bible, great leaders such as Moses and the prophets frequently referred to themselves as servants of the Lord. This positive sense of servitude was instilled in Jesus from his early Jewish training, and he said plainly, \"Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant\" (Matt. 20:27).\nLeadership involves being servant both to God and to our fellow human beings. In essence, the leadership role is far from being exalted above others. Mary Baker Eddy, the Leader of Christian Science, wrote, \"The true leader of a true cause is the unacknowledged servant of mankind (\"Miscellaneous Writings 1883-1896,\" p. 266). Thinking of oneself as a servant instead of a master is essential to having faithful followers. When this attitude of serving is exhibited in a leader, his or her right to authority is upheld by divine law.\nThe ultimate goal for both leaders and followers, I believe, is to see God's kingdom come on earth and for us to find our direction to do God's will. While the journey may seem difficult, we can retain our inspiration by looking to the example of Jesus, the greatest leader of all time.\nIt is unfeigned love for both God and our fellow humans that makes a good leader, caring for the flock he or she is to guide. And the \"sheep\" find comfort as they follow their leader. Their innocence and freedom from taking or giving offense will save them from the wrong leadership, even as it saves the leaders from mistakes and failures. In scriptural terms, we are all taught (led) by God.\nRobert Reich What makes a leader?","timestamp":"2019-04-25T10:21:23Z","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1113/p18s01-hfcs.html"}
{"text":"Why is Christmas pagan and what is an alternative tradition to Christmas one can do instead? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.\nWhy is Christmas pagan and what is an alternative tradition to Christmas one can do instead?\nPaganism is merely a religion other than one of the main world religions. In other words, the only thing that distinguishes paganism from Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Shintoism, or Judaism is the number of people that have signed up for the newsletter. It isn’t something to fear and it is bigotry to act like it is.\nChristmas is a holiday that has evolved due the passage of time and the influence of various cultures as Christmas has entered their lives. Each of those cultures has enriched the holiday, giving us more traditions with which to celebrate it.\nIf we traveled to the ancient world, we would find some kind of celebration at that time, in many places, each at first independent of the others. For the ancient Romans, that holiday was called Saturnalia, named for the god Saturn. Saturnalia was celebrated by feasts, the giving of gifts, and a brief sense of equality through role-reversal as the masters tended to the servants. The ancient historian, Livy, tells us that Saturnalia began in 497 BC. Modern historians believe it probably started earlier than that. So, at least half a millennia after the origin of Saturnalia, Jesus Christ was born. His birth was not initially a holiday, because birthdays were not then celebrated in Jewish culture. It would be a few centuries until early church leaders decided it was a day to put on the calendar and commemorate. It would also be a few centuries until they decided to pick a day for that celebration, because the gospels do not tell us on what day he was born.\nOn December 25th, 274 AD, the Emperor Aurelian consecrated the temple of Sol Invictus, creating a holiday called Dies Natalis Solis Invicti – the birthday of the Sun – officially elevating the Sun to the highest position among the gods – nudging a steering current towards monotheism.\nShepherds watch their flock by night during lambing season, which is the spring. But there’s no rule that says a day of celebration has to coincide with the actual date of origin. In Britain, we celebrate the Queen’s birthday on June 9th instead of her actual birthday of April 21st, because April showers bring May flowers.\nSo, in Rome in the fourth century, there were three big holidays being celebrated on December 25th – Saturnalia, Dies Natalis Sol Invictus, and the Dies Natalis of the Christ. It’s only natural that elements from these celebrations would cross-pollinate each other, especially when they fit so well – for example, the gift giving of Saturnalia could be adopted by Christians as symbolic of their God giving his only son to them as a gift on that day.\nAs Rome faded and Christianity grew, the people that celebrated those holidays would take their traditions to new areas. As those early Christians moved into Northern Europe and introduced Christmas to the native Germanic peoples, the practices of Christmas were influenced by the practices of those peoples for their winter solstice holidays. Over time, traditions like the Yule log, mistletoe, tree decorating, and evergreen wreaths were absorbed and became thought of as Christmas traditions. The Saxons, the Vikings, the Victorians, and the capitalists have all added traditions to the rich tapestry of the holiday we all call Christmas.\nThere’s nothing to be feared from those traditions. They are additive, not dilutive. Pagan contributions are not something to fear. Heck, today is Wednesday, for English speakers and Miercoles for Spanish speakers. Where do you think those names come from? Wednesday comes from the pagan Germanic god Woden and Miercoles comes from the pagan god Mercury. We are no more corrupted by having a “pagan” Christmas tree in our house than we are by having a calendar that says Wednesday or Miercoles on it.\nChristmas: How did your kid react when you told them Santa isn't real?\nHolidays: What is the best wine to go with turkey?\nHistory: What is the coolest obscure historical fact you know?","timestamp":"2019-04-25T08:04:53Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/12/15/is-christmas-a-pagan-holiday/"}
{"text":"While specific incidents involving police violence – from the killing of Mike Brown in Ferguson, MO, to the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island – have been highlighted in protests all over the country since the summer, some commentators have attempted to contextualize the unrest. They detail what many describe as the daily injustices, especially in black communities, suffered by residents in their routine interactions with the police.\nIt is these daily interactions that create the foundational distrust that has exploded into a national phenomenon this year, activist Opal Tometi explained.\nYet, the police do not act independently but within a wider framework attentive to social order and, in many places, the maintenance of the status quo.\nIn New York City, local policing reforms have focused on departmental policies and tactics, but less attention has been paid to the bedrock of the NYPD's authority, the laws that officers, as agents of the state, have been empowered to enforce.\nIn New York City alone, there are nearly 10,000 laws, violations, rules, and codes that a person might break, and the NYPD initiates approximately 1 million punitive interactions with residents every year. Almost none of these interactions have anything to do with serious crime. About half result in summonses. Of arrests, just 25 percent are related to felonies. Between 2001 and 2013 there were nearly 7 million summonses issued in New York City, compared to 5 million 'stop-and-frisks' during the same period. In 2014, tickets for jaywalking were up about 275 percent.\nIt hasn't always been this way. A concerted effort was made by city lawmakers in the 1990s to expand the authority of the NYPD to include enforcement for behaviors that had not previously been considered crimes. This shift provided legal justification for the routine intrusions that some, like Tometi, have pointed to as provocation for the apparent decline in legitimacy felt towards the police in specific neighborhoods around the New York City.\nWhile the police have borne the brunt of recent protests targeting criminalization and brutality, lawmakers have generally been left off the hook, despite their crucial role in determining which behaviors are considered \"criminal\" and which are not. The City Council - not the police - has the power to roll back some of these laws, providing them with perhaps the largest lever to push in fundamentally changing the relationship between the police and residents. The Council also provides oversight for the NYPD and controls, with the Mayor, the agency's budget.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, law enforcement resources were focused on serious crimes. As order-maintenance policing became en vogue in academic circles, and was adopted by NYPD Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani here in New York, the size of the police force was expanded and the emphasis shifted from policing serious crimes to the enforcement of low-level penal code violations and infractions of the City's administrative codes. Above all, Bratton wanted an increase in the number of interactions between the police and the public.\nFor the police to stop people constitutionally, however, they needed justification. In addition to beefing up enforcement on existing low-level laws, a strategic effort was made by the City Council and Giuliani, at the NYPD's urging, to create new laws explicitly for this purpose. Thus \"aggressive panhandling\" entered the realm of criminal conduct. At the time some council members balked, claiming the new laws and codes were \"repressive,\" that the NYPD should not have increased authority to control particular behaviors, but today, it's the new normal.\nIn the early 1990s, along with a huge rise in misdemeanor arrests (recently detailed in a John Jay College report) there was a concomitant rise in summonses, which refer to behaviors, typically, that do not rise to the level of criminality. The number of summonses issued by the NYPD exploded, jumping from 150,000 in 1993, to nearly 500,000 just five years later. Of the seven most common summons infractions, which make up about half of all summonses in New York City, only two are actually penal code violations - that is those laws dictated by the State of New York. The others are violations of administrative code, health code, parks rules, and traffic law - generally local rules dictated by City Council. Open liquor container citations - an administrative code violation - were, in 2013, the top summons offense in the city. At least one judge has suggested that the police are enforcing this rule in a racially discriminatory way.\nIn the beginning, state lawmakers pushed back against this effort by the City Council, Bratton, and Giuliani to criminalize what had previously been legal behavior (in some cases de facto), in large part because they were concerned about the costs associated with adjudicating these new criminal cases – almost all of them violations and misdemeanors – in court. And so, in 1995 the State enacted a law that removed from criminal court jurisdiction all non-misdemeanor offenses charged under the Administrative Code. This would have made infractions, such as open container and public urination, into civil penalties, akin to a traffic ticket to be adjudicated in administrative, rather than criminal proceedings. Giuliani viewed the state law as \"potentially devastating\" because it divested the City of certain law enforcement authority.\nAt the behest of Giuliani, the City Council responded to the state bill with its own legislation to retain jurisdiction over violations. This allowed the police to continue the practice of using infractions as justifications to stop, question, detain, search, warrant check, and identify people who were suspected of breaking minor rules. This cemented the heyday of so-called \"broken windows policing\" - which Bratton, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and others credit for leading to the city's precipitous drop in violent crimes, although this assertion is contested.\nIn one manifestation of the approach, marijuana enforcement was increased as a way to control public gatherings of youth – not necessarily to curb marijuana use. \"The police were not really interested in the possession of marijuana but instead used marijuana arrests to try to discover people with felony warrants outstanding against them,\" Criminologist Frank Zimring explained.\nOne result of Bratton's new strategy was a dramatic increase in the number of defendants in criminal court with no prior criminal court experience – and the population of people marked with a criminal record began to grow swiftly. As did distrust of police. People with criminal records or open and unresolved cases are left vulnerable to heightened enforcement should they come into contact with police at a later date.\nOver forty certified city agencies – from the Human Resources Administration to the Sanitation Department – have the legal authority to issue summonses, yet the vast, vast majority are written by the NYPD. In 2013 there were 458,095 summons issued citywide, down from 510,270 the year before and from a peak of 648,638 in 2005. As of late 2014 the city was on pace to see the decline continue, a trend perhaps welcomed by the communities most heavily impacted by summons practices – the same communities targeted by stop-and-frisk, vertical patrols, and Operation Impact.\nAs the data shows, it is specific neighborhoods targeted for this type of policing. For example, there were roughly the same number of summonses issued in the single Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook as issued in the entire borough of Staten Island in 2012; the jurisdiction of the Red Hook court covers approximately 200,000 people - less than half the population of Staten Island.\nAlso targeted are specific demographic groups. While only 17 percent of dogs in the city are licensed, according to an estimate by the Health Department, 91 percent of people ticketed for the offense of having an unlicensed dog are either Black or Latino. Black residents are especially likely to be stopped by police when they are moving through a mostly white neighborhood, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union. Police argue they simply go where the crime is.\nBroken Windows policing in New York City has been operationalized to mean the aggressive enforcement of minor crimes and violations in specific, targeted neighborhoods, and, as the NYCLU analysis suggests, against specific demographics of people; whether or not any of this has had any impact on crime reduction in New York remains unproven.\nThere is no empirical evidence to support the idea that aggressively enforcing so-called \"quality of life offenses\" through police actions has had a positive impact on public safety. These behavioral offenses, some of which are technically crimes, and others, like riding a bike on the sidewalk, which are violations, have come to include actually legal actions such as playing music on the subway platform or falling asleep on the train, for which people are now receiving criminal summonses.\nSome academics have argued that the social costs of these enforcements, which might lead to job loss, housing eviction, or loss of parental rights, outweigh the benefits.\nMeanwhile arresting and incarcerating, for example, a homeless person who cannot afford bail, costs the city at least $600 per day simply for housing at Rikers Island, which does not include the law enforcement or court administration costs; financially there is not a more expensive option to manage this quality of life concern.\nBratton and de Blasio have been vocal supporters of this type of policing, generally, while acknowledging the necessity of reforming the manner in which police interact with the public and suggesting that there should be off-ramps for people who have already been arrested to avoid spending time in jail for minor crimes. Arrests in 2014, both the gross numbers and the volume of misdemeanor cases, virtually mirror those of 2013 - the final year of the previous administration.\nThese policies have already scarred a generation of New Yorkers with criminal records and seem to have played a starring role in inspiring the profound distrust of the police felt in certain communities in New York. This distrust has turned to widespread civil unrest in the wake of the death of Eric Garner, who was accosted by six police officers soon after breaking up a fight. It doesn't seem from the evidence we have that Garner, accused of selling \"loosies\" – a tax violation – was breaking any laws when he was stopped by the police that day. He did not have any illegal cigarettes on him at the time of his death and was never charged with a crime.\nYet, the broken windows policies implemented by the City Council empowered the police to attempt to take him into custody. The law Garner was accused of violating, roughly speaking, is a similar type of offense as being paid off the books to babysit.\nIn December, New York City Council members joined the protests against police brutality, staging a \"die-in\" on the steps of City Hall, chanting \"I Can't Breathe\" and \"I am Eric Garner\" to honor the Staten Island man. Even as the City Council decried the results of the overreach of police influence, the body, led by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, has sought to add 1,000 new cops to the force. While these additions would ostensibly be given the additional training and oversight aimed at improving the quality of police-resident interactions, (new training chief Michael Julian is working with officers to get them to swear less frequently) the Council could also consider using its legislative authority to reduce the quantity of police-resident interactions.\nWhile a small number of members have raised concerns about broken windows policing specifically, the Council as a whole has remained mostly silent on the unlimited role of the police in initiating the interactions with residents of the City that invariably lead to summonses, arrests, and incidents of brutality. The Council did announce a plan to open CCRB outposts in the district offices of participating council members, but it is unclear how many members will participate and when, or if, that initiative will get off the ground.\nThe police reform legislation currently before the Council, such as the Right to Know Act, which has wide support among council members but is opposed by Bratton and de Blasio, focuses on the content of police interactions rather than the number.\nThere has yet to be a legislative proposal for the Council to invoke its authority to limit the role of the police by carving out certain quality of life offenses from their jurisdiction or mandating civil enforcement where the NYPD has that discretion. Fare evasion can lead to either a civil summons or an arrest - there were 24,747 such arrests in 2013 and 89,128 summonses. Black residents were most likely to be arrested, rather than given a summons.\nIronically, the NYPD, in apparent protest following the death of two on-duty officers last month has stopped enforcing many quality of life violations. While the sample size remains too small thus far to provide much statistical evidence either for or against a reduced role for law enforcement, it does provide an opportunity for the City to consider ways of addressing community concerns besides the knee-jerk response for more police.\nAccording to former cop and current John Jay professor Eugene O'Donnell, rank-and-file officers would welcome a reduction in their responsibilities to enforce quality of life concerns. \"The root of this is that loose cigarette enforcement is a lunatic mission that no cop ever joined the NYPD to be part of,\" O'Donnell recently said.\nNick Malinowski is a social worker and independent journalist, living and working in Brooklyn; and is on Twitter @nwmalinowski.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T12:28:17Z","url":"http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/government/5497-city-council-power-over-broken-windows-policing"}
{"text":"A bizarre interstellar object called 'Oumuamua continues to perplex astronomers a year after it vanished. Here's why a few scientists still wonder if it was alien.\nAn illustration of the space object 'Oumuamua flying through the solar system in late 2017.\nA building-size object called 'Oumuamua flew through the inner solar system in late 2017.\nTelescopes observed the mysterious interloper, but scarce data has left questions open about the object's shape, size, and composition.\nA few astronomers wonder whether it could be alien, but 'Oumuamua is most likely a \"slightly weird\" asteroid, comet, or space rock.\nNew space missions are being dreamed up to intercept the next interstellar object that visits our solar system.\nIn 2016, something roughly the size of a skyscraper emerged from deep space and careened toward the inner solar system.\nThe mysterious object flew within about 15 million miles of our planet on October 14.\nBut it wasn't until four days later that humanity finally spotted it in telescope data. By then, it was moving away from the sun at a speed of more than 110,000 mph. It took days for astronomers around the globe to point every tool they could in its direction.\nAstronomers initially called their unprecedented catch \"1I/2017 U1,\" with \"I\" standing for interstellar - or from another star system. The object was later dubbed 'Oumuamua, a Hawaiian name that's pronounced \"oo moo-uh moo-uh\" and means \"a messenger from afar, arriving first.\"\n'Oumuamua remains one of the most significant, confounding, and at times contentious astronomical discoveries in recent memory. Little is definitively known about its composition, mass, shape, or dimensions - it may be a 3,300-foot-long cigar, a city-block-size pancake, or something in-between.\n\"This one's gone forever. We have all the data we're ever going to have about 'Oumuamua,\" David Trilling, an astronomer at Northern Arizona University who led Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the object, told Business Insider. \"Now it's trying to understand if we can tell a story. Do we know what's going on?\"\nRead more: Smart aliens might live within 33,000 light-years of Earth. A new study explains why we haven't found them yet.\nEnough doubt surrounds 'Oumuamua that at least one reputable astronomer and a few of his colleagues continue to speculate about potential alien origins. But nearly all other experts who have studied 'Oumuamua say the aliens hypothesis is extraordinarily unlikely.\nHere's what we know about 'Oumuamua, why it probably isn't alien, and how astronomers are preparing for another interstellar object to unexpectedly sail through our solar system.\nA view of the Pan-STARRS observatory in Hawaii.\nResearchers in 1976 predicted that other star systems were likely ejecting big asteroids and comets and flinging them toward our solar system, suggesting we could perhaps spot some in the future.\nBut the most recent estimate of how often such interstellar vagabonds would pay us a visit (and be detectable) was \"bleak,\" according to the authors of a study published just months before 'Oumuamua was discovered. The odds, in fact, were low enough that practically no one was overtly looking for these space objects.\nThen on October 19, 2017, Robert Weryk, a postdoctoral student at the University of Hawaii, discovered 'Oumuamua somewhat by accident.\nWeryk was perusing a batch of data collected by an observatory called Pan-STARRS (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System) that sits atop a mountain in Maui. The observatory scans the entire sky each night, allowing astronomers to compare fresh data to the previous evening's. Anything that's bright enough to detect and moving will thus stand out.\nAs Weryk told The Atlantic in November 2017, he initially thought the object was a typical asteroid. But after a glance at the previous evening's data, he realized it was unusual.\n\"I'd never expected to find something like this,\" he said.\nCalculating the exact path of 'Oumuamua took about a week. The math showed it was an object from beyond - way, way beyond. Its orbit was \"unbound\" or loop-less, and it was making a checkmark-shaped trip through the solar system. It had entered from above the plane of the solar system, dipped close to and below the sun, and was exiting out the top.\nThis realization prompted Weryk, fellow astronomer Karen Meech, and others to launch a global effort to observe 'Oumuamua with as many powerful telescopes as possible before it vanished. More astronomers eventually followed suit, though with some delay.\n\"I was caught off-guard, and I think a lot of astronomers were, too,\" Trilling said. \"It took a while for many of us to think, 'I should go look at it.' The delay was people thinking, 'Naw, it couldn't be from another solar system.'\"\nBecause of this element of surprise, and the fact that world-class observatories are scheduled months or years ahead, it took a week or more for powerful telescopes to start looking at 'Oumuamua. Hubble didn't observe it until November 2018, then again before the object vanished from sight in January 2018.\nNo telescope resolved its shape in any discernible detail, though. One observatory was equipped to do so - the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico - but nature had other plans.\n\"Unfortunately, the Arecibo Observatory missed the opportunity to determine the actual shape of 'Oumuamua due to Hurricane Maria, really bad timing,\" Abel Méndez, an astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, told Business Insider.\nIs it a comet, asteroid, or something else?\nAn artist's depiction of interstellar object 'Oumuamua.\nThe observations that were made suggest 'Oumuamua has a fairly uniform surface, is relatively dark, and has a reddish color (which is not unusual for deep-space objects).\nLacking any detailed photograph of 'Oumuamua, astronomers resorted to studying its brightness as the next-best method to deduce its shape. This is because any side of an object that faces the sun will reflect light; a longer side tends to reflect more light than a shorter side because it has a greater area. Repeating changes in brightness can also betray the rough dimensions and 3D-motion of a space object.\nEarly calculations suggest 'Oumuamua tumbles about once every eight hours and has a cigar-shape, with a large-to-small-dimension size ratio of roughly ten to one. That is abnormal.\n\"The most extreme bodies we know of in the solar system are three-to-one,\" Trilling said.\nAnother peculiarity is that in January 2018, on its way toward interstellar space, 'Oumuamua deviated from its predicted path by about 25,000 miles.\nIf 'Oumuamua were a typical comet, this might explain its change of direction: Comets that drift close to the sun warm up, which causes internal gases to evaporate. The shooting jets of these gases can act like small rocket engines, altering the path an object travels and the way it tumbles.\nIn such cases, the evaporating gases form a tail behind the rock. They can also cause big chunks of a comet to break off. But no tail or break-up of 'Oumuamua was definitively seen.\nThere was also another surprise from the Spitzer Space Telescope: It did not detect a heat signature. The fact that Spitzer was unable to detect that heat suggests 'Oumuamua is somewhat shinier than a normal object, since less warmth being absorbed means more sunlight is getting bounced away.\nTrilling said \"shiny\" is relative, though -'Oumuamua could be as dark as \"dirty slush\" in a gutter, and that would be shinier than expected.\n\"We're not talking about a ball of tin foil flying through space,\" he said.\nHowever, an extraordinary possibility - an unnatural object - did occur to some researchers, a few of whom chose to test the idea against the limited observations.\nComet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko as seen by the Rosetta spacecraft on October 9, 2015.\nAvi Loeb, the chair of Harvard University's astronomy department, took the peculiarities of 'Oumuamua as reason to pursue the remote possibility that 'Oumuamua might be alien in origin.\nIn December 2017, Loeb directed Breakthrough Listen (an effort to listen for alien signals that Loeb helps run) to point radio antennas toward 'Oumuamua. No alien communications were detected.\nIn October 2018, Loeb and a colleague wondered in a study whether the object might have a more extreme pancake-like shape. Based on mathematical analysis, they suggested it could perhaps be as thin as a sail that could be pushed by light (also called a lightsail), which might also explain the 0.1% change in direction found by Hubble.\nMost recently, Loeb and an undergraduate student published a brief study suggesting 'Oumuamua might actually have a 50-to-1 size ratio if it's cigar-shaped, or a 20-to-1 ratio if it's more of a pancake.\nLoeb defends his pursuit of the idea as a valid scientific argument, given the data available. In a blog post at Scientific American, he wrote that humans spotting alien technology \"might resemble an imaginary encounter of ancient cave people with a modern cell phone,\" at first interpreting it as \"shiny rock\" and not a \"communication device.\"\nHowever, Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory, told Business Insider that Loeb's latest paper is based on a misunderstanding of brightness data from a study that Hainaut co-authored. Hainaut added that Loeb's conclusions \"collapse\" when the uncertainty of the data is taken into account. Loeb and a co-author disputed this, claiming the uncertainty is not as great as Hainaut said.\nMany researchers interviewed by Business Insider also noted that because the observations of 'Oumuamua were relatively distant, limited, and filled with gaps, there's not nearly enough data to reasonably make extraordinary claims (which, as Carl Sagan once quipped, require extraordinary evidence).\nHainaut thinks the object is most likely a \"slightly weird\" space rock, as does Trilling.\n\"All of the evidence is consistent with a rock,\" Trilling said. \"We've never seen an alien spaceship - we have no idea what that evidence would look like. So I think it's just a rock.\"\nTrilling said he accepts the possibility, however remote, that Loeb and his colleagues' \"extreme\" ideas could eventually be borne out.\n\"I don't have any direct evidence that says it has to be a rock and it cannot an alien spacecraft,\" he said. \"The only way to do that is to go visit it.\"\nBut for now, Trilling explained that it's most logical to side with hundreds of years of astronomical research.\nA Falcon 9 rocket built by SpaceX launching a satellite into space.\nSince 'Oumuamua, astronomers have made adjustments at major observatories to allow for more rapid-turnaround observations of the next rare interstellar object that comes to town.\n\"With this one, we were taken fairly by surprise,\" Hainaut said, adding for the next one: \"We are ready.\"\nThe research community has also reconsidered how often things like 'Oumuamua might visit the solar system. Trilling and others published a study suggesting that current observatories may see an interstellar interloper about once every five years. By the mid-2020s - after new telescopes come online that are designed to look for Earth-threatening asteroids - they might be spotted at a rate of once per year.\nThis, in turn, has led multiple groups of researchers to wonder if a small spacecraft could be readied to chase down another interstellar visitor like 'Oumuamua and study it up-close. Hainaut is part of one of the groups researching that idea.\n\"We had a workshop on this in October, and at the beginning of the workshop we said, 'This is impossible.' But after one week of hard work, we realized it's not impossible anymore, it's just difficult,\" Hainaut said. \"Impossible? That's a problem. Difficult? As a first approximation, that just means expensive.\"\nThere's also a chance that, decades from now, a project called Breakthrough Starshot that Loeb is part of might resolve the question of what 'Oumuamua is and is not.\nStarshot aims to propel tiny spacecraft to another star system with powerful lasers, perhaps at around 20% the speed of light. Such robots could also hypothetically be sent to catch up to 'Oumuamua in deep space.\n\"The Breakthrough Starshot is extremely interesting. The problem is that the laser technology that is required is far from being ready,\" Hainaut said. \"I hope it will be one day.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-24T05:52:59Z","url":"https://nordic.businessinsider.com/oumuamua-interstellar-space-rock-alien-spaceship-evidence-2019-1"}

Head to Rüschlikon in Zurich, where, eight metres below the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Centre, IBM Research has six new \"noise-free\" labs. \"Their purpose is to enable research at the scale of single molecules and atoms,\" says Emanuel Lörtscher, a nanoscale electronics researcher and the designer of the lab. \"At this scale, disturbances -matter.\" The lab doesn't just cancel out sound, but also electromagnetic radiation, vibrations from the ground, temperature and humidity, all of which can affect experiments. \"These are varieties of noise -- it's not just acoustic noise,\" says Lörtscher, who started designing the lab five years ago.\nThree pairs of Helmholtz coils provide an active cancellation system and purpose-designed air-conditioning controls -temperature to + or -0.01°C. Lörtscher built two prototype labs before completing the final six in early 2011 -- it took the next two years to set up the ultra-precise equipment. \"All the details, they really matter,\" Lörtscher says. \"If you lose a magnetic piece inside the lab, you screw up the whole magnetic-field compensation.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-22T21:09:21Z","url":"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/silence-please-atoms-at-work"}
{"text":"Mounir el-Motassadeq, one of the only men sent to prison because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is now a free man. He was released from the maximum-security Fuhlsbüttel prison in Hamburg on Oct. 15, blindfolded and with his hands sealed, and taken to the airport to board a commercial flight bound for Morocco. No one is quite sure what will happen to him next.\nEl-Motassadeq was friends with Mohammed Atta, the pilot of the first plane to hit the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001. He also signed Atta’s will and had power of attorney over the bank accounts of Marwan al-Shehhi, the pilot of the plane that hit the second tower. They all had prayed together in a mosque in Hamburg, which was shut down eight years ago.\nEl-Motassadeq, who also spent time in an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, has always denied being anything more than friends with the hijackers. He still maintains he knew nothing of the plot. ”I didn’t even know they had gone to America,” Deutsche Welle reported him as saying in reference to the hijackers.\nThe Moroccan was arrested in Germany two months after the 9/11 attacks, becoming the first person to be indicted. After five years of trials and appeals, he was convicted of being a member of a terrorist organization and an accessory to the murders of 246 people aboard the two planes that were crashed into the World Trade Center. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, which he served until this week. El-Motassadeq is banned from re-entering Germany until April 2064.\nNot many others have been arrested or charged with crimes in connection to 9/11.\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of bin Laden’s deputies, was captured in 2003 in Pakistan and transferred to Guantanamo Bay. He admitted being part of 19 successful or attempted terrorist attacks, including the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, Richard Reid’s attempt to blow up an airline, the bombing of a nightclub in Bali, and many more. “I was responsible for the 9/11 operation, from A to Z,” he said through his personal representative at a military tribunal hearing, the transcript shows (pdf, pp. 17-18).\nBarack Obama attempted to try Mohammed in New York in 2009, but after a wave of opposition, it was announced Mohammed—who was waterboarded 183 times in a single month in March 2003—would face a military trial at Guantanamo. His case is still ongoing.

{"text":"Mexico's first supercar: Can it compete with the best?\nWhen you think of famous car-producing nations, Mexico is probably not at the top of your list. But two brothers, Guillermo and Iker Echevarría, are on a mission to change that with a two-seater built by their own fledgling manufacturer, Vuhl.\nVuhl's first creation, the 05 is a bare-bones halfway home between the sort of car that only cares about going fast around the track, and one that provides more accessible B-road thrills. Yet the fact its 2.0-liter Ford engine develops 285 bhp in something that has a dry weight of 695 kilograms means it is anything but short on performance.\nThe speed at which the 05 went from an idea to a car you can buy is no less impressive than its design. The 05 first surfaced in concept form back in 2013, unveiled by former British Formula One driver Stirling Moss at the Royal Automobile Club in London. A week later, Formula One driver Esteban Gutiérrez was driving it up the hill at the Goodwood Festival of Speed to show it meant business.\nThree years later, sales of the Vuhl 05 have begun.\nIt was all but inevitable that the brothers, who have a background in industrial design, would be bitten by the motoring bug. Their father, Guillermo Echevarría senior, was a racing driver and loved to tinker with cars at home -- a pastime that lasted 30 years, Iker explained. No wonder, then, the 05's design inspiration comes from a motoring heyday of unlimited power outputs and few regulations that gave us the legendary Porsche 917 and McLaren M8F.\n\"The Vuhl 05 design is inspired in Can-Am racers from the '70s,\" Iker said. \"No doors, no roof, no windscreen, and an exposed roll bar. The challenge was to make the essence of this iconic cars work in a contemporary concept without looking like a retro.\"\nThe resulting design is an aggressive mix of clean lines, gentle curves mixed with a hint of Batmobile and the function over form ethos seen by other cars in its space. \"It will age well through time,\" he added confidently. \"We intend the Vuhl 05 and it successors to be renowned for their effective simplicity and aesthetics guided by a purity of function.\"\nThough the spirit is Mexican, the Vuhl is incredibly multicultural. The tub holding everything together is Mexican, but around 50 percent of the components are British. The engine, meanwhile, is American and various body panels come from Canada.\nBut is an international pedigree enough to tempt the more snobbish buyer used to British, German and Italian cars?\n\"We are aware that Mexico doesn´t have an engineering or racing heritage as strong as other countries like Germany or UK which will always be a barrier,\" Iker said. \"Nevertheless, Mexico is living one of its best moments in motorsport with two Mexican drivers in F1 -- Formula 1 -- and (FIA World Endurance Race is) back to Mexico.\"\nLike many fledgling supercar makers, Vuhl has had its share of critics who said Vuhl was going to be yet another wannabe supercar maker that dies a death before it has even started. Yet three years on, the company has just announced a more potent version of the 05 known as the 05RR.\nWith the 05 and 05RR under its belt, Vuhl has cause for celebration yet success takes time and respect must be earned. But for now Vuhl can exploit a gap between a number of established rivals. \"It's a lot of money for a not-actually-that-exotic car, but it sits in a niche above (British manufacturers) Zenos (and) Caterham and below Radical (and) BAC that nobody else seems to be in, so the market is there for the taking,\" motoring journalist Phil Huff, explained. \"That it's Mexican is irrelevant -- I think few people will even realize that.\"\nWith plans to make around 25 05 cars a year, each one costing from £60,000 ($78,250), Vuhl has a long way to go before Britain, Germany and Italy have anything to worry about, but never has Mexico had such a chance to make an impact in the performance car world.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T18:54:33Z","url":"http://www.cnn.com/style/article/vuhl-first-mexican-supercar/index.html"}
{"text":"After the Yes Men pulled their now-famous prank earlier this week on the US Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber issued a vague threat of “law-enforcement action.” The group doesn’t appear to have called the cops on the Yes Men just yet, but on Wednesday it issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act take-down demand notice for the parody site that the Yes Men set up to publicize their fake event, in which the “Chamber” announced that it would support a sane global warming policy after all.\nThe Chamber’s attorney at the intellectual property law firm Kenyon & Kenyon issued a notice to the Yes Men’s internet service provider, Hurricane Electric, asking them to take down the site. “The website infringes the Chamber of Commerce’s copyrights by directly copying the images, logos, design, and layout of the Chamber of Commerce’s copyright-protected official website, located at www.uschamber.com,” they wrote.\nThey ask Hurricane to “take down all such infringing material” and/or end their business relationship with the Yes Men. “Continuing to be the ISP for this material could subject Hurricane Electric to legal liability,” the letter states.\n“We are certain you can understand our client’s concerns, and its need to protect its intellectual property,” it continues.\nAnd now the Electronic Frontiers Foundation is jumping in, telling the Chamber to take a chill pill. The site, they say, fits within the accepted fair use and parody rights.\nUPDATE: It seems that Hurricane, fearing the Chamber’s legal rebuke, pulled the plug on both the Yes Men site and May First/People Link, the group that was directly providing service for the Yes Men. Hurricane was the upstream provider, but a May First/People Link in turn provided service for the Yes Men and 400 other groups. So, for a period last night, all 400 groups had their websites shut down.\nThe Yes Men issued a press release on Friday stating that May First/People Link was able to get the service reconnected for the other groups. Meanwhile, the Yes Men have relocated the parody site.\nIt also presented a problem for ticket sales, as the Yes Men’s latest film, The Yes Men Fix the World is currently in theaters. The action, say the Yes Men, threatens theaters (which also happen to be small businesses) who may be selling tickets through the Yes Men site.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T00:19:16Z","url":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/10/site-sore-eyes-chamber-targets-yes-men-parody-website/"}

{"text":"Thanks to ever more sophisticated technology, it is much easier to obtain data - and to analyze it - than was thought possible even a few years ago. As a result, there is an understandable feeling that decision-making in organizations today is more scientific and soundly based than was the case in the days when hunches, gut feel and experience guided much activity. However, leaders must not be seduced into thinking that basing decisions on data necessarily makes them beyond reproach.\nIndeed, in an article in the Fall 2018 issue of Rotman Management, the magazine of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, Megan MacGarvie and Kristina McElheran argue that \"in some instances, data and analytics actually make matters worse.\" This is because, even with impressively large sets of data and the latest, most effective analytical tools, executives can still fall into various traps, particularly if they take shortcuts in reasoning in an effort to overcome information overload.\nIn the article, which was previously published in the HBR Guide to Data Analytics Basics for Managers, MacGarvie, associate professor in the markets, public policy and law group at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, and McElheran, assistant professor of strategic management at the Rotman School of Management and a digital fellow at the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, point out that it is widely acknowledged by academics in a variety of disciplines that people do not carefully process every piece of information in every decision. Instead, they say, we rely on heuristics, or simplified procedures that help us make decisions when faced with uncertainty or where there is insufficient money or time for extensive analysis. The result is we think we are making sound decisions when in fact we are making systematic mistakes. On top of this, even with access to data, human brains are geared to adopting certain biases that distort choices often without us being aware of them.\nMacGarvie and McElheran identify \"three main cognitive traps that regularly bias decision-making, even when informed by the best data\" and offer suggestions for avoiding them.\nThe Confirmation Trap. This is what happens when we pay more attention to findings that align with our existing beliefs and ignore other facts and patterns in the data. Confirmation bias can become much harder to avoid when individuals are under pressure from bosses and colleagues to come up with data that supports a pre-existing view of the world, say MacGarvie and McElheran. Their advice for dealing with the issue? Don't avoid information that does not fit with you or your boss's beliefs. Instead, embrace it by such means as specifying in advance the data and analytical approaches that will be used in the decision-making in order to reduce the temptation to \"cherry-pick\" findings; actively seek out findings that disprove your beliefs; do not automatically dismiss findings that fall below your starting point for statistical or practical significance; assign several independent teams to analyze the data separately and if they do not come to similar conclusions concentrate on the points where they diverge in order to see whether the differences are due to error, inconsistent methods or bias; and treat your findings as if they were predictions and test them.\nThe Overconfidence Trap. Senior decision-makers are especially prone to this, say MacGarvie and McElheran, for the simple reason that they tend to assume that they have been promoted on the basis of past successes that have themselves been based on making decisions. But overconfidence can also reinforce many other pitfalls of data interpretation. \"It can prevent us from questioning our methods, our motivation and the way we communicate our findings to others; and it also makes it easy to under-invest in data analysis in the first place,\" they write. This can be a particularly difficult problem to crack because, while overconfidence can dissuade us from spending enough time or money on acquiring more information or doing extra analysis, just acquiring more information can make matters worse by adding to the sense of confidence. As MacGarvie and McElheran say, moving from data to insights \"requires quality inputs, skill and sound processes.\" They stress the importance of processes, making several procedural tips for escaping this trap. Among them are describing your ideal experiment and then comparing this with your actual data to see where it might be lacking; making being devil's advocate a formal part of the process; keeping track of predictions and systematically comparing them with what actually happens in order to test their accuracy; and making such processes a part of the decision-making routine in order to avoid persistent biases creeping back in.\nThe Over-Fitting Trap. This is what happens when a statistical model describes \"random noise\" rather than the underlying relationship an organization is seeking to capture. As MacGarvie and McElheran put it, \"When your model yields surprising or counterintuitive predictions, you may have made an exciting new discovery - or it may be the result of 'over-fitting.'\" They quote Nate Silver, the statistician who found fame for predicting the winner of all 50 states in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, as describing this concept as \"the most important scientific problem you've never heard of.\" The problem is that over-fit models look like they do a very good job of explaining the nuances of the past but struggle to predict the future. To overcome this bias, they suggest randomly dividing the data into a training set, on which the model will be estimated, and a validation set, which will be used to test the accuracy of the model's predictions; as with the confirmation trap, avoid cherry picking data; look for relationships that measure important effects related to clear and logical hypotheses before looking at nuances; look to see whether it is possible to construct another story using the same data; and beware the common tendency to see patterns in random data.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T12:29:47Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogertrapp/2018/09/24/how-to-get-better-at-using-data-to-make-decisions/"}

Hopf that 11 days doesn’t make a baseball season.\nThe unlikely slugger continued the best power surge of his career Sunday night by hitting two home runs to lift the Somerset Patriots to a 5-2 victory against the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in front of 5,899 at TD Bank Ballpark.\nHopf, who went homer-less in his first 102 at-bats this season, has smashed five in 19 at-bats since Aug. 19 to match a career high set in 57 games between Single-A and Triple-A for the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007.\n“Let’s hope he keeps breaking that (record) all the time,” Patriots manager Sparky Lyle quipped.\nThe Patriots (27-24, 63-58) maintained a one-game lead atop the Freedom Division by prevailing for the eighth time in 10 games and taking the rubber game of the series from the Atlantic League’s winningest team.\nHopf homered in the second inning against starter John Koronka, who issued seven walks in 4 2/3 innings and was fortunate to escape with only four runs on his ledger.\nAll nine Patriots’ starters reached base at least once by the fourth inning despite a total of four hits off Koronka (0-3).\nOn the other hand, Bill Pulsipher was plain old effective.\nPulsipher (4-1) scattered five hits, struck out six and walked one. The former major leaguer left after six innings with a 4-1 lead, marking the sixth time in eight starts since his acquisition that he has allowed two runs or fewer.\nBen Grezlovski, who helped recruit Pulsipher to the Patriots, kept the lead in tact through a precarious seventh. The first two batters homered and doubled, respectively, but the submariner induced a ground-ball double play with runners on the corners and one out.\nJeff Kennard’s turn to come up big came in the eighth.\nThe Blue Crabs (30-18, 71-47) loaded the bases on three consecutive two-out singles but Kennard struck out Ben Harrison swinging on a pitch diving out of the strike zone.\nHopf furthered the momentum swing with a home run to center field in the bottom half of the frame.\nScott Williamson brought the potential tying run to the plate in the ninth but struck out the side to notch his seventh save.\nJosh Pressley hit one of the longest home runs in the 12-history of TD Bank Ballpark but the Patriots lost 5-3 to the Blue Crabs.

{"text":"ENT specialists are aplenty and ear buds too have been around for quite some time, but many Delhiites still love to get their ears cleaned by the traditional ear-cleaners.\nEar cleaning is one of the oldest professions on the streets of Delhi. It is a skill handed down from father to son through generations.\nAsk any ear-cleaner and he will say all his ancestors have followed the same profession. “I learnt the art from my father, and my father from his.\nWe have done nothing else. This has always been our family business,” says 30-year-old Mohammed Anas, who offers his unique service in Connaught Place.\nMost traditional ear-cleaners in Delhi come from Moradabad. Like their forefathers, they come to the bigger cities looking for clients. In Delhi, the ear-cleaners find their patrons in Chandni Chowk, Connaught Place, G B Road, in office areas as well as in cinema halls and railway stations. They have not entirely lost favour with the educated elite either.\nIt is rather easy to spot the ear-cleaners, thanks to their peculiar red headgear and the small shoulder bags that hold their ear-cleaning paraphernalia. They solicit by sidling close to passersby and announcing their trade. If anyone agrees, the ear-cleaners take him or her to a quiet spot and get down to work.\n“It is an intricate job and not everyone can do it. We can do it as it is in our blood,” says Sheikh Raza , a 45-year-old ear-cleaner who has been cleaning ears since he was 18.\nAll ear cleaners have five basic cleaning tools which they make on their own. They are thin and spindly and made of steel. One end of the instrument is wrapped in a small wad of cotton and inserted into the ear. The ear-cleaner rotates his instrument in the ear for a while and removes the wax.\nHis next task is oiling the ears with mustard oil and then the job is done. In more complicated cases, for instance when a foreign body has to be extricated from the ear, the cleaner has a special tool with a tiny hook at one end. And it is in such cases that the ear cleaners' services are most sought.\n“Doctors can never take out objects from ears as successfully as we can,” says Sheikh. He narrates an incident when doctors failed to remove a grain of wheat from a patient's ear. “The doctors only managed to push the grain further into the ear. It took me only a minute to take it out,” he claims.\nThe doctors on the other hand warn people against accepting the services of ear-cleaners. Rajiv Puri, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospital, says that ears have a self-cleaning process and there is no need to clean them.\n“Inserting objects can pose a risk to the eardrum, and other delicate parts of the ear,” he says. But those who love to get their ears cleaned turn a deaf ear to the doctor’s advice to savour the pleasure of traditional ear cleaning.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T22:46:01Z","url":"https://www.deccanherald.com/content/227148/some-therapy-ears.html"}

{"text":"Warehouse retail king Costco recently ended its relationship with American Express in favor of a new one with Visa and Citigroup. And after a bit of a bumpy start, it looks like the new deal is starting to pay off.\nCostco chief financial officer Richard Galanti said in a conference call with investors Thursday that nearly 11.5 million former Costco AmEx cards have now been transferred to Visa and Citi.\nWhat’s more, Galanti added that 1.1 million additional customers have applied for the new Costco Visa-Citi card — and that more than 730,000 new accounts have already been activated.\nCostco took a lot of heat initially for making the switch. The AmEx card was popular with the retailer’s members … and the execution of the switch from AmEx to Visa wasn’t exactly a smooth one.\nBut it appears that those problems are in the past. The company is now benefiting from the fact that it is paying lower fees to Visa than it did to AmEx.\nShares of Costco rose 4% Friday. The company also reported quarterly earnings late Thursday that topped Wall Street’s forecasts.\nBut the stock, which has been a Wall Street darling for the past few years, has stumbled a bit in 2016. Shares are still down 5% this year — even after Friday’s big rally.\nInvestors are worried about increased competition from Amazon — which is touting home delivery of groceries — as well as Walmart’s Sam’s Club unit.\nLower food prices are hurting too, even though consumers love it.\nThe big decline in the prices of many agricultural commodities has been a problem for Costco as well as big grocery chains like Kroger, Supervalu, Sprouts and Whole Foods.\nLow oil prices — despite a recent uptick — have been a problem too since it means reduced sales and profits for the gas stations that Costco has at many stores.\nThere are also concerns that Costco could lose customers if it raises the cost of its annual membership fee, something Galanti hinted at in March.\nFinally, the company was told by a jury Thursday that it must pay $5.5 million to Tiffany as a result of a lawsuit involving fake Tiffany diamond engagement rings being sold at Costco.\nThat’s not a huge amount of money for Costco.

{"text":"Everybody got a little hot under the collar this week as European Council president Donald Tusk became the latest to let his frustration with the United Kingdom get the better of him, suggesting that “a special place in hell” awaits those who backed Brexit without a plan.\n“I’ve been wondering what that place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan for how to carry it out safely,” he said after a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\nMost seemed to agree it was an unhelpful intervention at a time when relations with the UK are at an all-time low, and the withdrawal agreement at an impasse in the House of Commons with no sign of a way forward.\nTusk should also have known that nobody outdoes the DUP when it comes to fire and brimstone. The party’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson channelled his inner Dante to describe Tusk as a “devilish, trident-wielding euro maniac”, no less.\nWilson wasn’t the only one to react. British prime minister Theresa May said the remark had caused “widespread dismay” in the UK, while former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said being free of “unelected arrogant bullies” like Tusk sounded “like heaven”.\nThese days though, Brexit seems a lot more like purgatory than heaven or hell. There were yet more calls from London this week to reopen the withdrawal agreement and – you guessed it – more refusals from Brussels, leaving the process very much in limbo.\nMay travelled to Belfast on Tuesday where she told business leaders that her commitment to avoiding a hard border was “unshakeable”. She also signalled her intention to push the European Union to agree to a time limit being placed on the backstop.\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested a “creative” approach to talks could see the backstop questions resolved, but that re-opening the withdrawal agreement was “not on the order of business”.\nIf the UK didn’t have enough on its plate dealing with Brussels and Dublin, the United States threw in its tuppence worth during an event in the Capitol building to mark the 100th anniversary of the Dáil.\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England warned that Britain faces its weakest economic growth in 10 years this year, blaming mounting Brexit uncertainty and the global slowdown. But it stuck to its message that interest rates will rise, if a Brexit deal is done.\nThe latest company to jump ship in the UK was UBS which received approval from a London court to move up to €32 billion in assets from Britain to Germany.\nThe uncertainty surrounding Brexit was the main reason the European Commission cut its growth forecasts for Ireland this week.\nIn its latest set of winter forecasts, Brussels forecast the Irish economy would grow by 4.1 per cent this year in gross domestic product (GDP) terms, down from 4.5 per cent previously. That was lower than the Government’s forecast of 4.2 per cent.\nThere was a warning also from the Central Bank, which said that if the State’s transition to a low-carbon economy is too slow, it will pose macroeconomic and financial stability risks as sharper adjustments will be necessary.\nGovernor Philip Lane said the financial system had a central role in managing climate risks and financing decarbonisation, but that regulatory policies and supervisory practices must also play their part.\nThat being said, the latest economic indicators painted a pretty rosy picture for the State. Household debt fell in the third quarter of 2018, reaching its lowest level in 13 years, the latest figures from the Central Bank showed.\nThe regulator said household debt fell by €518 million in the third quarter to €137.5 billion, or €28,316 per capita, at the end of the three-month period, the lowest point since 2005.\nMeanwhile, the Republic’s jobless rate remained steady at 5.3 per cent for the second consecutive month in January. That was the lowest recorded since February 2008 and is almost three points below the euro zone average.\nElsewhere, VAT receipts jumped to a record €2.7 billion in January as strong pre-Christmas sales boosted the Government’s tax take for the month. The latest exchequer returns show the sales tax accounted for more than half the €5.4 billion in tax collected.\nThree of Ireland’s richest men – Denis O’Brien, Dermot Desmond, and Michael O’Leary – will be glad to see the back of this week after each suffered setbacks in their business dealings.\nDigicel, the Caribbean telecoms company owned by O’Brien, became embroiled in a $1.5 billion US lawsuit over allegations it is a “co-conspirator” in a “ruse” to divert cash that is meant to fund education in Haiti, but is instead allegedly spent corruptly.\nDigicel said it “categorically denies . . . any wrongdoing of any kind” and insisted it follows the law. “Digicel has always conducted its business in Haiti consistent with all applicable laws and regulations,” it said.\nElsewhere, the Central Bank opened an investigation into Datalex, in which Desmond holds a 26.4 per cent stake, after it issued a massive profit warning last month and revealed that it had uncovered a possible accounting issue.\nThe regulator is understood to be looking at Datalex’s trading statement less than eight weeks earlier in which the company said it was performing in line with expectations and was “confident” about posting double-digit percentage earnings growth.\nFinally, O’Leary said he was “disappointed” as Ryanair recorded a loss of €20 million in the three months ended December 31st due to a fall in air fares and a rise in fuel prices.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T04:49:48Z","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/tusk-learns-hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-brexiteer-scorned-1.3786915"}
{"text":"Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis, which started with strikes by teachers, students and those in the legal profession in late 2016 and now includes groups calling for secession, is deepening. People from English-speaking South-West and North-West regions of Cameroon have long complained about their marginalisation in the centralised state apparatus in Yaoundé and the government’s failure to protect Anglophone heritage.\nOpinion is divided on how to address the Anglophones’ concerns. Victor Mukete, member of the ruling party and the country’s oldest senator, tells sister publication Jeune Afrique that a federal system should be created “as soon as we are capable of financing it.” A fringe group has declared an independent state of Ambazonia, but many people say that a fairer system rather than a separate system would be the best solution. Yaoundé’s response so far has been a security crackdown and creating a weak national commission on the issues of bilingualism and ­multi-culturalism. President Paul Biya launched a government reshuffle in early March, separating the decentralisation portfolio from the interior ministry. Elanga Obam George, a technocrat who worked in prime minister Philémon Yang’s office, is the new minister of decentralisation.\nThe Anglophone crisis also highlights the often difficult relationship between neighbouring Cameroon and Nigeria. Back in 1961, the United Nations (UN) organised a referendum in the areas colonised by Britain, giving northern and southern Cameroon the options of joining Nigeria or joining Cameroon. The North went to Nigeria, and the South went to Cameroon.\nSince the flare-ups of late 2016, the UN estimates that nearly 20,000 Cameroonian refugees have fled to Nigeria. Anglophone Cameroon’s economy, heavily integrated with Nigeria, has been severely affected as many small towns and villages have been abandoned. Businesses often close down for ‘ghost town’ protests. Meanwhile big firms with interests in the region are reporting reduced profits, and cross-border trade has slowed to a trickle.\nCameroon and Nigeria share a long border, with security flashpoints along the 1,975km frontier. Nigeria’s north-eastern states of Borno and Adamawa and Cameroon’s Far North Region continue to deal with a significant Boko Haram insurgency while an escalating pastoral conflict between Fulani herdsmen and settler communities is currently raging from Adamawa through Taraba and Benue into parts of Cross River, with small arms proliferation in Akwa Ibom and other states in the Niger Delta.\nThe stakes are getting higher, as Cameroon will hold elections in 2018, and President Muhammadu Buhari will be up for re-election in 2019. A wider expansion of the anti-separatist crackdown could lead to increased tensions between the governments in Abuja and Yaoundé, a state of affairs not unheard of as both countries have clashed over territory, access to resources and political interference in the past.\nAnger from citizens who feel left behind by South Africa's development -- known as 'service protests' is resurfacing ahead of elections; anger that politicians are navigating around, and even capitalising on.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T20:14:46Z","url":"https://www.theafricareport.com/648/country-focus-cameroon-regional-ructions/"}
{"text":"Thousands of Oregon hunters need to start planning their fall forays this weekend as Monday&apos;s deadline for controlled hunt application looms.\nFall may be months away, but it’s time to start planning your big-game hunt. Apply online, at a license sales agent or Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife office that sells licenses by 11:59 p.m. Monday to get a shot at controlled-hunt tags for most big-game species.\nThe cost is $8 per application, and hunters need a 2017 annual hunting license to apply.\nWhile it doesn&apos;t pay to be a latecomer to the drawing, it certainly seems to be an ingrained trait among Oregon hunters.\nLast year, more than half of the 467,028 applications were submitted in the week before the deadline, including nearly 74,149 on deadline day, according to ODFW.\nMany hunters wait until the last minute to apply, which can cause long lines at stores and ODFW offices, ODFW Wildlife Division spokeswoman Michelle Dennehy says.\nNew this year, as part of efforts to simplify the regulations, final tag numbers are already printed in the 2017 Oregon Big Game Regulations.\nIn the past, the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission did not set big-game tag numbers for the fall hunts until June.\nThe agency has reduced tag numbers for some Eastern Oregon big-game hunts to account for high winter mortality of deer and pronghorn in some Eastern Oregon units, the agency says.\nODFW used the controlled-hunt lottery as a way to mete out tags and distribute hunting pressure for specific hunts and species. It does not include general-season hunts such as deer and elk hunts in the south Cascades.\nThe Rogue Valley&apos;s younger outdoors enthusiasts will have a chance to test-drive a variety of outdoor activities, including hunting and fishing, during a free Saturday event May 20 at the Denman Wildlife Area.\nYoung Oregon Hunters Day will give youth ages 5 to 16 a chance to try such activities as trout fishing, tomahawk throwing, shotgun and archery shooting and laser shooting, and they&apos;ll have a chance to learn to identify animal species by their pelts.\nThe 16th annual event, often referred to as YOH Day, will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Denman, 1495 E. Gregory Road in White City. Parental consent and chaperones are required.\nThe event is sponsored annually by the Rogue Valley Chapter of the Oregon Hunters Association, along with ODFW and Black Bird Shopping Center.\nFood and beverages will be available, and a free raffle drawing will occur.

{"text":"Making the most of natural resources of farms is critical in today’s environment, where rainfalls are becoming ever so scarce.\nWhile in Queensland the use of animal recognition technology is being used to conserve water, on the other side of the country in Western Australia, satellite technology is providing farmers with a suite of tools to accurately estimate the amount of feed in their pastures, how quickly their pastures are growing and the pasture quality.\nJointly developed by the CSIRO and Western Australia’s Department of Agriculture and Department of Land Information, the project, called Pastures from Space, uses satellite data from NASA to monitor the efficient use of feed resources in the livestock industries.\nThe Pastures from Space message is clear: use it or lose it.\nFor maximum efficiency on a farm, farmers need to use the pasture when it is at its best. This was one of the main drivers for the project, which predicts the quantity of green pasture in each paddock for a farm, or Feed on Offer (FOO), as kilos of dry matter per hectare.\nAccording to Gonzalo Mata, who is in charge of farming systems and web development for the project, the general rule of thumb is that only about 20 to 30 per cent of pasture grown is utilised in many beef and sheep production systems. This is because a lack of information on feed resources leads to conservative management as a means of mitigating risk.\n“Farmers need this information in order to match the animals’ nutrient demands for growth and reproduction with the supply of feed which can be very seasonal. If this is not achieved, production is lower or costs increase through the use of supplements to achieve the balance,” Mata added.\nAccording to Mata, you can’t manage what you can’t measure, hence the need for allowing farmers to measure how much pasture there is on their farms. The project also predicts the rate of growth of pasture, or Pasture Growth Rate (PGR), on a weekly basis as kilos of dry matter per hectare per day.\nThe PGR tool uses images from a NASA satellite to create a composite greenness index. The climate data is sourced from the Bureau of Meteorology on a weekly basis and the two data sources are combined in a pasture growth model.\nPastures from Space boasts a 97 percent accuracy and it is possible farmers with a subscription (which costs $900 per year) to have sustainable pasture utilisation of more than 50 percent.\n“When the farmers get their system up and running, the level of interaction that they have is only limited by their ability to ask questions of the data. New information is downloaded on a weekly basis using a software package called ‘Pasture Watch’ and can review the automatically generated graphs showing PGR for individual paddocks or combination of paddocks depending of what decision he is trying to make,” Mata said.\nBy going online, the farmer can also look at maps of PGR for their farm, giving them a better understanding of why some parts of a paddock or of the farm are performing better than others.\nAs of 2007, Pastures from Space had 80 commercial subscribers, and the numbers of people accessing the non-specific satellite measurements on the free Web site is growing.\nMata says the numbers have been growing every year by at least 10 percent, and up to late last year, nearly 10,000 unique IP addresses had visited the Web site.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T11:06:29Z","url":"https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/301239/view_from_space_satellite_farming_greener_pastures/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=tagfeed"}
{"text":"The local comedy world is in mourning following the shock death of beloved satirist John Clarke.\nClarke, a regular fixture in TV and film – most prominently his groundbreaking political interviews with Bryan Dawe – died while on a hiking trip in Victoria, aged 68.\nHis death has sparked countless tributes from local comedy personalities who worked with the prolific star and have spoken about his enduring legacy.\nMost notable among those has been fellow giant of Australian comedy Barry Humphries, who is outraged at Clarke's sudden passing.\n\"How dare he die! John wasn't just funny, he was original and he was very, very nice,\" Humphries said.\n\"When Bruce Beresford and I were making the first Barry Mackenzie movie in the early '70s we had a scene in a London pub favoured by Australians. We'd cast a mob of noisy Aussies drinking and when we ran the somewhat random footage Bruce said, 'Watch this bloke'. We ran it again and froze frame on a young man at the bar drinking. He might have had one line, or maybe just a word, but he was terribly funny and terribly real. It was John Clarke.\n\"I've been watching him and admiring him ever since. He deserves a state funeral.\"\nFrank Woodley, who worked as a script editor and \"mentor\" on his 1997 series The Adventures Of Lano And Woodley with Colin Lane, shares Humphries' admiration. \"From the first time I heard a Fred Dagg cassette to this week's Clarke and Dawe, John Clarke made me laugh. Every time,\" he said.\n\"John could be silly and serious but he always had a twinkle in his eyes that made me happy. 'Trust your instincts. You boys know what you're doing.' I can still hear John's distinctive dry voice saying that to me as if it was yesterday.\"\nCharlie Pickering, host of ABC's comedy slot The Weekly, on which Clarke and Dawe appeared last year, praised Clarke's towering impact on local political satire.\n\"If you are going to have the nerve to make jokes about the news in Australia, you do so knowing you will never clear the bar set by John Clarke,\" he said.\n\"John and I once talked about how writing a good comedy script was somewhere between poetry and physics. Whatever that middle ground is, John Clarke deserved the Nobel Prize.\"\nHe had \"an incalculable gift\" for comedy, said Max Gillies, for whom Clarke wrote The Gillies Report in 1984. \"At school we were told sarcasm was the lowest form of wit, but John Clarke spent his whole life giving the lie to that. It was in his comic bloodstream, a deep sense of outrage that kept his blood pumping and the electricity in his brain firing.\"\nWendy said Clarke was instrumental in making comedy mainstream by fighting for television funding in the mid '80s. In doing so, he gave and many others their big break.\n\"Comedy then just completely took off,\" she said. \"It was the thing everybody wanted to watch. John had sown the seed. For something like 30 years, John has been advocating and mentoring for comedy to take its place among the Australian arts.\n\"I think his contribution to the nation has been peerless.\"\nFans, both local and from across the Tasman (\"Now we'll claim him back. He's our Phar Lap of comedy,\" New Zealand director Taika Waititi said), shared personal recollections of the man – and tidbits of his most celebrated work.\n\"He was always a lovely guy to me,\" said Dave Hughes. \"He was a brilliant man who made me laugh a lot from a very young age and continued to make me laugh over the past 25, 30 years. It's such a big loss.\"\n\"John can read the Mildura phonebook and get a laugh,\" said Matthew Saville, who directed him in his final film role, as real estate agent Phillip Lang in 2015's A Month of Sundays.\nWil Anderson, who spent much of the day leading a YouTube deep-dive into Clarke's best bits, called Clarke \"the funniest satirist on TV, until the end that came way too soon.\"\nClarke's stablemates over at ABC, including 7:30's Leigh Sales, also shared their memories of the comedy legend.\n\"Respected by his peers, adored by his fans, loved by his colleagues with a reputation as one of the nicest blokes,\" wrote Sales.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T01:10:34Z","url":"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/john-clarkes-incalculable-gift-for-sarcasm-deserved-nobel-prize-say-friends-comedians-20170410-gvhq4l.html"}

{"text":"Carl Johnson, co-founder of Anomaly, a marketing communications firm and advertising agency, isn’t actually staying in Cannes. He’s staying at the historic Hotel du Cap in Antibes, an extravagant celebrity destination since the early days of Hemingway. Johnson has a bit of the Hemingway in him himself, insofar as he has a gut and some stubble, curses somewhat liberally, and actually says what he thinks. In a town—he drove in to Cannes for our interview—where so many people are repeating variations on familiar themes, he made for a refreshing lunch partner.\nJohnson, now in his early 50s, hadn’t been to Cannes for over a decade. After Sept. 11, 2001, the then-COO of TBWA\\Worldwide packed up the family and moved from New York to Sydney, where he spent two years “on the beach.” He only got back into advertising in 2004, when he started Anomaly: the firm or agency or whatever you want to call it—he prefers “a place for clients to go when they don’t know where to go”—that is responsible not only for successful Budweiser, Converse, and Sony campaigns, but for the Emmy-winning television show Avec Eric, the experience of flying Virgin America (down to the interior, the uniforms, and the entertainment), and all the posters and stickers around New York City for a soccer team that doesn’t even exist . . . yet. In 2010, Adweek picked Anomaly as one of six top insurgent agencies to watch.\nWe were sitting at a table on the terrace of the Carlton Hotel, which is to Cannes Lions’ wealthier delegates what Rick’s was to Casablanca. Arguably, you could meet everyone you wanted to meet at this festival without leaving your table. (Ours, incidentally, had been offered to us by Arianna Huffington.) But that also had something to do with the fact that so much of what was being said on stage sounded the same. The chances of getting through a lecture in Cannes without hearing a CEO or CMO or COO talk about the importance of “content” was about as good as your chances of getting a helicopter ride out to a yacht, which is to say, roughly one in 20.\nHere was something else. And that, of course, is what Anomaly set out to be. But it’s been seven years since 2004, and in the new landscape, there are many agencies that describe themselves as “not an agency” and talk about “breaking down silos.” So how long can Anomaly continue to be an anomaly?","timestamp":"2019-04-25T14:45:23Z","url":"https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/cannes-has-changed-and-content-isnt-king-132888/"}
{"text":"A straight man discovers his inner drag queen in Matthew Lopez's gender-bending comedy, The Legend of Georgia McBride, being given its New York premiere by off-Broadway's MCC Theater. Featuring enough amusingly bitchy one-liners and energetic musical numbers to be a genuine crowd-pleaser, the play is frothy to the extreme, a show for people who find Mamma Mia! heavy lifting. But its relentless silliness is sweet and amiable enough to make it go down easy.\nSet in Panama City in the Florida Panhandle, the comedy centers on good-hearted slacker Casey (Dave Thomas Brown), trying to make ends meet by performing as an Elvis impersonator at Cleo's, a seedy beachside bar run by the financially hard-pressed Eddie (Wayne Duvall). When Casey bounces a rent check buying pizza, and his wife Jo (Afton Williamson) suddenly announces she's pregnant, their situation goes from dire to desperate. And things get even worse when Eddie informs Casey that he's dropping the Elvis act in favor of a drag routine performed by his cousin Tracy (Matt McGrath) and his — excuse me, her — equally flamboyant friend Rexy (Keith Nobbs), whose stage name is Anorexia Nervosa.\nCasey reluctantly stays on as bartender, but when Rexy shows up for work drunk one night he's recruited to take her place performing an Edith Piaf number. Quickly coming up with the stage name Georgia McBride — inspired by the state in which his mother was born and the last name of the first girl he kissed — Casey receives a crash course in drag performing from Tracy, which, it turns out, is all about attitude.\nAt first his performance is dismal, but Casey discovers that he has a nascent talent and quickly adapts to his new persona, becoming a local sensation, lip-synching to the likes of Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. His renewed joy in performing, however, is offset by his determination to keep his new identity a secret from Jo and, well, you can guess the rest of the plot from here.\nMaking a major stylistic departure from his previous work The Whipping Man — a searing post-Civil War era drama that's become a favorite on the regional theater circuit — Lopez demonstrates an equally stellar gift for amusing dialogue and farcical humor. While not all the one-liners land — Rexy's comment, \"I've been raped in better places than this,\" upon setting foot in Cleo's being one unfortunate example — the ratio of hits to misses is admirable.\nBrown is boyishly appealing in the title role, tearing into his drag routines with gusto and looking gorgeous as his female persona. McGrath is even better as his drag queen mentor, investing his portrayal with equal amounts of hilarious bitchery and hard-won dignity. The supporting players are also impressive, particularly Nobbs, who doubles as the married couple's good-old-boy landlord.\nDirector Mike Donahue's staging is sleek and fast-paced; set designer Donyale Werle has expertly transformed the stage into a rundown dive bar, complete with Christmas lights and neon signs; Anita Yavich's costumes and Jason Hayes' wigs are amusingly over-the-top; and Paul McGill's choreography of the drag routines would pass muster in any nightclub.\nDespite its earnest message of tolerance, The Legend of Georgia McBride is too lightweight to register as anything more than a mild diversion. But it's highly entertaining nonetheless.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T20:29:11Z","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/legend-georgia-mcbride-theater-review-820854"}

{"text":"According to a report issued by the Pew Research Center, American adults have a sub-par knowledge of basic science. The organization surveyed 3,278 Americans of various social, racial and academic backgrounds. The questionnaire involved a simple set of 12 questions that assessed basic science competencies. Despite the quiz was far from demanding, most test-takers answered only 7.9 questions out of 12 correctly. That’s 66% or a big fat ‘D’.\nSee the rest of the questions and take the quiz yourself here.\nOnly 6% of the quizzed participants answered all 12 questions correctly. At the other end of the spectrum, 1% of those surveyed missed 11 of the questions, 2% missed 10 and 3% missed nine.\nformal education predicted how well respondents fared on the quiz. Those who earned at least a graduate degree got 9.5 questions right, on average, compared to 6.8 for those who only finished high school.\nmen answered more correct questions than women, even when correcting for social background or education. Men outscored women, 8.6 to 7.3, on average.\nwhites did better on the test than Latinos or African Americans. Their average scores were 8.4, 7.1 and 5.9, respectively.\nmore than one in five respondents thought “the study of how the positions of stars and planets can influence human behavior” was astronomy, instead of astrology. For quite a few, it seems, the two are interchangeable.\nNow, I don’t think this poll was the best way to gauge American interest or general knowledge in science, but it was interesting nonetheless. It shows the American public is still lagging behind the needs and expectations of an increasingly technology-driven society. It also means that people are more susceptible to fraud and rhetoric when discussing topics like climate change, genetically modified organisms or energy policy. The more you know, the harder you are to fool.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T11:07:26Z","url":"https://www.zmescience.com/science/americans-d-in-science-53543/"}

{"text":"SAN FRANCISCO — The outgoing chair of the California GOP — the nation’s largest state Republican Party — has issued a dire warning that his state represents “the canary in the coal mine” for the party‘s national fortunes unless it confronts demographic shifts that have already turned California into a majority-minority state.\n“We have not yet been able to figure out how to effectively communicate and get significant numbers of votes from non-whites,’’ said former state Sen. Jim Brulte, who’s held the job of state GOP chair since 2013 and will retire in February.\nDespite trend lines that show the “the entire country will be majority minority by 2044,’’ he said, the GOP has failed to confront the reality of those changes — or recognize the possibility that the recent \"blue tsunami\" midterm election in California was a harbinger of what lies ahead for the national party.\nBut he said those warnings about the changing political and ethnic landscape have gone unheeded.\n“And that’s why I have said that I believe California is the canary in the coal mine — not an outlier,’’ for the GOP in the coming cycles, he told POLITICO.\nThe California chairman’s comments come days after some state party leaders — including former state party chair Shawn Steele — charged that the party’s shellacking in 2018 was less about demographics and more about Democrats’ use of new practices at the ballot box, suggesting they could have involved voter fraud.\nBrulte told POLITICO he categorically rejects the notion that voting irregularities may be the source of the party’s historic beating in the 2018 midterms in California, where Democrats flipped seven House seats and left the party with just seven members in the congressional delegation, the lowest number since the 1940s. He said Republicans were repeatedly informed of ways that Democrats were marshaling new and effective ways to get out the vote — but campaigns failed to take action.\n“We personally briefed the candidates, the congressional delegation, the legislators,’’ and even staff inside the White House in 2017 on the upcoming changes in California laws that might affect turnout,’ said Brulte, who lead his party for decades in the legislature.\nBrulte pointed to new laws that allowed for “motor voter” registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles, same-day registration, and new efforts to register younger voters. And, he said, campaigns were specifically informed of changes which legalized “ballot harvesting” — coordinated efforts to gather and return absentee ballots with voters’ permission, a program which backers said would assist older or disabled voters.\nWhile Democrats used ballot harvesting with great success in a collection of key races here where mail ballots made up the margin of success, “we’ve not been able to find Republicans having a lot of success anywhere related to ballot harvesting,’’ he said.\nBrulte, who said in 2013 it would take a minimum of six years to rebuild the dilapidated state party, has taken heat within the GOP for speaking out about the dangers it faces.\nDespite Brulte's stark assessment of the GOP's future, three potential candidates are vying to replace him as chair when his term ends next February — and all of them insist the real problems lie somewhere other than in its message to the changing ethnic electorate.\nSteve Frank, a conservative Republican activist and former party official, said that the GOP has “unilaterally disarmed itself,’’ by failing miserably in outreach to church-going conservatives and other GOP voters — and by standing by helplessly while laws that have advantaged Democrats, including the state’s top-two primary, act as “illegal voter suppression” against Republicans in California.\nFormer Assemblyman Travis Allen, a favorite of the party’s far right conservative wing — who failed to get the GOP gubernatorial nomination last year — says he strongly rejects Brulte’s suggestion that demographics are at fault for the party’s 2018 battering.\n“We need to start with the central matter at hand: the Democratic Party, and the special interests that control it, are the mightiest political machine in the history of American politics,’’ he said.\nIn California, as in the national party, Republicans continue to dismiss the stark evidence of growing ethnic voter clout in hopes of returning to “an America that was the way it used to be,’’ Sragow said. “They’re rubbing the rabbits’ foot and think they’re going to take back the homeland.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-19T07:12:59Z","url":"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/07/california-elections-2018-republican-party-jim-brulte-1048192"}

Fourteen minutes later, the plane&apos;s captain and some first-class passengers heard banging coming from beneath the aircraft. The pilot decided to return to the airport and declared an emergency for priority landing.\n\"I think we’re hearing a noise from the baggage compartment,\" the pilot said, according to KCPQ. \"Might be a person in there, so we’re going to have to come back around.\"\nAfter the plane landed a ramp agent came out from the front cargo hold, which Alaska said is pressurized and temperature-controlled. The area is often where animals are kept during flights.\n\"Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep,\" the airline said.\nThe man, an employee of Alaska contractor Menzies Aviation, walked off the plane. He was initially checked by medics at the airport and found to be unhurt, airport spokesman Perry Cooper said.\nThe man was also checked at a hospital and released, the airline said Monday evening. After his release from the hospital, he passed a drug test, airline spokesman Bryan Zidar said.\nThe airline did not identify the worker. A Menzies spokesman did not immediately return an email request for comment and details about the employee.\nAlaska Airlines said the man started work at 5 a.m. Monday and was due off at 2:30 p.m.. He had been part of a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight.\nBefore the plane departed, the leader of the man&apos;s team noticed he was missing, called into the cargo hold for him and called and texted the man&apos;s cellphone but got no answer, the airline said. Co-workers thought he had finished his shift and gone home.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, spokesman Allen Kenitzer confirmed in an e-mail.\nAll ramp employees undergo full criminal background checks and drug checks before hiring and are subject to random drug tests during their employment, the airline statement said.\nThe plane carried 170 passengers and six crew members.\nThe flight departed again at 3:52 p.m. and arrived at a terminal gate in Los Angeles at 6:29 p.m., more than an hour late, the airline said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T18:51:46Z","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/alaska-airlines-flight-returns-to-seattle-due-to-worker-trapped-in-cargo-hold.print"}
{"text":"While cybersecurity should be a year-round concern for small business owners, income tax filing season can bring some particular risks, according to the IRS.\nThe agency says it has gotten an increase in reports of attempts to obtain employees' W-2 forms in hopes of stealing people's personal information and identities. The scams often go after employees in companies' human resources and payroll departments, but any staffer or manager could be a target. In the scam, a potential thief poses as a company executive, sending an email from an address that might look legitimate, and requests a list of employees and their W-2s.\nOwners need to be sure that anyone with access to employee records including W-2s understands that they shouldn't send the forms or staffer information to anyone without checking to be sure this isn't an attempted scam. The IRS also wants companies to report W-2 scam emails to the agency, and it also wants to know if anyone has become a victim. For more information, visit the IRS website, www.irs.gov , and search for \"Form W-2/SSN Data Theft: Information for Businesses and Payroll Service Providers.\"\nThe IRS also warns all taxpayers about emails that look like they're coming from the agency but that are phishing attempts aimed at getting harmful software into a PC or a server. The emails might say that the taxpayer has a refund waiting at the IRS, or that the agency needs more information from the taxpayer. There's likely to be a link or an attachment that the reader of the email is supposed to click on - and that's how thieves and hackers gain entry to a computer.\nThe IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media; it sends letters by U.S. mail. Company owners and their employees need to be on guard against all kinds of phishing scams, and no one should ever click on a link or attachment until they're completely sure the email is legitimate. And if an email says it's from the IRS, it's not.\nAccountants and other tax professionals are also targets of thieves looking to steal personal information and identities, the IRS says. It has a page on its website devoted to providing paid tax preparers with information so they can protect themselves and their clients. The address is www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/protect-your-clients-protect-yourself .\nSome small business owners struggle with getting their financial records organized and keeping them that way, and that makes tax filing season more difficult.

{"text":"Iglesia collections stashed in Cayman?\nIGLESIA ni Cristo (INC) members in the United States were asked to bring $100 bills for their offerings, a former head of the church’s foreign mission said as he confirmed receiving reports about INC leaders skimming cash off collections as early as 2011.\nAllegations that collections from cash offerings in the United States were being stashed possibly in the Cayman Islands have been swirling for some time, said former minister Isaias Samson Jr., who was expelled in July on suspicion that he was the one who wrote critical online stories about the INC governing council.\nSamson said that back in 2011, the arrival of a roving auditor to pick up the entire collections after worship services, instead of these being deposited in a bank, raised alarm bells among some congregations in the United States.\n“I know the members. They’re very close to me. And they were asking me: ‘How come offerings are being picked up immediately and the members were being asked to bring $100?’” he said in an interview last week.\nSamson received the reports when he headed the church’s foreign mission from 2007 to 2012. An ordained minister for 43 years, he was a resident minister in the United States for 18 years and in Europe for two years.\nWhen the new scheme was carried out, only amounts below $100 were deposited in the bank, Samson said.\n“This scheme probably began in 2011. The members were shocked but they’re very obedient. They just rationalized that the church needed the money for the construction of chapels until they found out that commissions were being made out of the construction of chapels,” he said.\nSamson was unaware if the reports reached INC executive minister Eduardo V. Manalo.\nOf an estimated 3 million INC members in the Philippines and abroad, some 100,000 can be found in the United States, according to Samson.\nHe accused INC leaders of illegally detaining him in mid-July, a charge dismissed by state prosecutors. He had been suspected of blogging about corruption in the 101-year-old homegrown church under the pseudonym Antonio Ebangelista. He has denied this.\nAmerican Vincent Florida, a former minister in the INC Northern Virginia congregation, has reported the sect, Manalo and general auditor Glicerio Santos Jr. to the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax fraud.\nFlorida told the Inquirer he filed his report in IRS form 3949A for failure to pay taxes in August.\nThe form is used for reporting suspected tax fraud, including false exemptions or deductions, kickbacks, false or altered document, failure to pay tax, unreported income and organized crime.\nFlorida left the church on July 30 amid charges of corruption in the INC and abduction of ministers critical of the sect’s leadership.\nHe claimed that congregations were asked to convert cash collections into $100 bills and turn over the money to district auditors. He said only offerings in checks were deposited in the bank.\nThe district auditors in turn remitted the cash to Santos during pastoral visits.\nHe did not respond when the Inquirer sought his comment on the alleged diversion of INC collections.\nINC insiders, collating testimonies from members in the United States, documented a scheme committed right under the noses of some ministers.\nThe offerings are converted into $100 bills at a local or parish for easier transport, collected by the district auditor or minister “under duress” and brought to a collection center, like a conveniently located chapel.\nThe collections are consolidated at a hotel where Santos, the INC’s chief finance officer, is billeted, or stashed in a vault at the church’s US main office in California, for eventual pickup.\nThe scheme is carried out during “big events”—when Manalo or Santos is around for a pastoral visit—and in locals headed by “obedient” resident ministers.\nIn their calendar, the major cash-generating thanksgiving services are held in the third or fourth weekend of July and in the third week of December.\nCongregations in Long Beach, California; Elizabeth, New Jersey; Washington, DC; Temple Hills, Maryland; Bronx, New York; Seattle, Washington; Anaheim, California; and Corpus Christi, Texas, received verbal instructions to collect $100 bills for the thanksgiving service in July, the insiders said.\nThe insiders said it wouldn’t be a surprise to find a huge drop in bank deposits.\nFor instance, from $20,000 in December 2011 and $20,500 in December 2012, the deposits dropped to $12,000 in December 2013 in a certain local, they said.\n“These are brought to the Cayman Islands through a small plane and then a big plane. The plane is registered in Cayman,” Samson said, citing reports from members in the United States.\nThe transport of money allegedly by the church-owned Airbus could not be confirmed.\nFlorida alleged that Manalo, Santos and other INC leaders had managed to stay under the radar for years because they carried the cash on a private plane that they used for their regular pastoral visits to the United States.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T06:55:46Z","url":"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/743521/iglesia-collections-stashed-in-cayman"}
{"text":"RACIST supporters at Colchester United have been blasted by Burnley boss Stan Ternent who claims they almost forced Ian Wright to quit the game after just two matches in the Second Division.\nIn his autobiography Stan The Man, Ternent describes Layer Road as an \"Essex fleapit\" and accuses U's fans of hurling \"the foulest racist abuse I'd ever heard at a football match\".\nTernent was furious after former England striker Ian Wright MBE was subjected to the tirade of abuse during a Second Division game in February 2000.\nColchester United made a full and unreserved apology after the incident and have worked tirelessly to eradicate the racist problem at their ground.\nMarie Partner, the U's chief executive, last night said: \"At the time, the club dealt with the incident in the appropriate manner and made a full apology to Ian Wright. With that in mind, we feel it is a shame that Mr Ternent – who has a reputation for being an extremely professional manager – has to stoop to that level to sell books and we will not be drawn into making similar comments.\"\nIt was only Wright's second game for Burnley where he joined after suffering abuse in Scotland while playing for Celtic.\nHe wrote: \"Whether running out for Arsenal at Wembley or for us in an Essex fleapit, with his jokes and gold-toothed smile, he gave the impression it didn't matter a damn.\"\nHe went on to describe the appalling abuse Wright suffered at Layer Road.\n\"Throughout each of the previous 90 minutes the Colchester crowd hurled at Wrighty the foulest racist abuse I'd ever heard at a football match.\n\"My face was red with shame as I stood on the touchline, powerless to stop the narrow-minded scum chanting sick songs at one of England's greatest players.\n\"The pride I'd felt for Ian as he ran out on to the pitch in Burnley colours rapidly became embarrassment.\n\"I'd persuaded him to play in a league where I believed he would be afforded dignity and respect.\"\nHe said that all the small section of racist supporters had to offer was \"jealousy, bile and bitter insults based on his skin colour.\"\nThey \"had had the chance to watch one of the most talented players our country has ever produced yet they chose to barrack him instead\", he said.\nTernent goes on to explain how Wright called him to say he wanted to quit because of the abuse but was eventually persuaded not to by Ternent and others but only played 17 times for Burnley before packing the game in to work in the media.\nIt is not the first time Colchester supporters have been labelled racist, among those left unhappy at a visit to Layer Road were Luton Town supporters who complained players and fans had been targeted.\nMs Partner added: \"Colchester United has one of the best records for crowd behaviour, indeed last season saw the U's have one of the lowest policing bills in the Nationwide League. Further to that, our record of just six arrests was again amongst the lowest, with none of those being for racist abuse.\n\"We are proud of that fact and are keen backers of the Kick Racism Out of Football scheme. In fact, our Community Sports Trust provided sporting and educational projects for thousands of local children, which cut across social, educational and racial boundaries.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-21T16:46:32Z","url":"https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/racist-u-s-supporters-slated-in-book-1-58414"}

Many Deaniacs are glad their man is attempting to take on the stalwarts of special interest, but others are upset that Dean’s bid could jeopardize another race for the presidency in 2008.\nSo what are Dean’s chances of winning the DNC chairmanship? Well, if the presidential contest in 2004 was an accurate indicator, his chances don’t look good.\nThe DNC chair, unlike the Democratic presidential primaries, is voted on by only 440 members of the DNC, not thousands of registered Democratic voters. Dean however, is a rhetorical threat to party brass, as his grassroots constituents are not happy with the corporate takeover of their party. So insiders are not likely to support his candidacy for fear Dean’s base could disrupt party business. Despite these worries among DNC members, there is little to indicate that Dean would perform his duties any different than the current DNC maestro, Terry McAuliffe.\nCertainly the support for Dean is coming from the left end of the Democratic mainstream, including organizations like MoveOn.org, among others. But this outside support is irrelevant; for it is unlikely to sway DNC members to vote for Dean as a result.\nAlthough there is some debate as to what direction a DNC head would steer the party, historically the leader of the DNC has been a corporate fundraiser, not a platform creator. And Howard Dean is not likely to satisfy these deep-rooted Democratic requirements in the eyes of the voting delegates. As a consequence Dean is unlikely to win the nomination.\nSad to say, hope for the Democrats is not on the way, regardless of who wins the DNC position next month.\nJoshua Frank is author of the forthcoming book, Left Out!: How Liberals Helped Reelect George W.

{"text":"There is no easy option for Northern Ireland after Brexit.\nDeciding on post-Brexit border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is becoming an issue for which the phrase \"the devil is in the detail\" could have been coined. Finding a satisfactory solution that delivers a border flexible enough not to damage international trade and commerce and doesn’t undermine the spirit, or the letter, of the Good Friday Agreement settlement is foxing Whitehall’s brightest.\nThe dial seemed to have settled on David Davis’s suggestion that there could be a \"digital border\" with security cameras and pre-registered cargo as a preferred alternative to a \"hard border\" replete with checkpoints and watchtowers.\nHowever the Brexit secretary’s suggestion has been scotched by the new Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, who says electronic solutions are \"not going to work\". Today’s Times quotes him saying that \"any barrier or border on the island of Ireland in my view risks undermining a very hard-won peace process\" and that there is a need to ensure the \"free movement of people and goods and services and livelihoods\".\nThe first is to ignore Dublin (and just about everybody in Northern Ireland for that matter) and institute a hard border along the 310-mile demarcation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Given it takes in fields, rivers and forests it’s pretty unenforceable without a Trump-style wall. More practically, it would devastate trade and free movement. Metaphorically, it would be a powerful symbol of division and entirely contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. The Police Federation in Northern Ireland has also warned it would make police officers \"sitting ducks for terrorists\". Moreover, the Irish government will never agree to this course. With the EU in their corner, there is effectively zero chance of this happening.\nThe second option is to actually keep Northern Ireland inside the EU: offering it so-called \"special status\". This would avoid the difficulty of enforcing the border and even accord with the wishes of 56 per cent of the Northern Irish electorate who voted to Remain in the EU. Crucially, it would see Northern Ireland able to retain the £600m a year it currently receives from the EU. This is pushed by Sinn Fein and does have a powerful logic, but it would be a massive embarrassment for the British Government and lead to Scotland (and possibly London?) demanding similar treatment.\nThe third option is that suggested by the Irish government in the Times story today, namely a soft border with customs and passport controls at embarkation points on the island of Ireland, using the Irish Sea as a hard border (or certainly a wet one). This option is in play, if for no other reason than the Irish government is suggesting it. Again, unionists will be unhappy as it requires Britain to treat the island of Ireland as a single entity with border and possibly customs checks at ports and airports. There is a neat administrate logic to it, but it means people travelling from Northern Ireland to \"mainland\" Britain would need to show their passports, which will enrage unionists as it effectively makes them foreigners.\nUnpalatable as that would be for unionists, the fourth option is simply to recognise that Northern Ireland is now utterly anomalous and start a proper conversation about Irish reunification as a means to address the border issue once and for all. This would see both governments acting as persuaders to try and build consent and accelerate trends to reunify the island constitutionally. This would involve twin referendums in both Northern Ireland and the Republic (a measure allowed for in the Good Friday Agreement). Given Philip Hammond is warning that transitional arrangements could last three years, this might occur after Brexit in 2019, perhaps as late as the early 2020s, with interim arrangements in the meantime. Demographic trends pointing to a Catholic-nationalist majority in Northern Ireland would, in all likelihood require a referendum by then anyway. The opportunity here is to make necessity the mother of invention, using Brexit to bring Northern Ireland’s constitutional status to a head and deal decisively with the matter once and for all.\nIn short, ministers have no easy options, however time is now a factor and they will soon have to draw the line on, well, drawing the line.\nKevin Meagher is a former special adviser at the Northern Ireland Office and author of \"A United Ireland: Why unification is inevitable and how it will come about\"","timestamp":"2019-04-22T10:24:08Z","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/07/irish-sea-border-and-3-other-tricky-options-northern-ireland-after-brexit"}

{"text":"ROCK CREEK -- From calling in Craig Robinson to host the Hollywood-themed 20th annual gala this Saturday, to implementing a new strategic plan, the Washington County Museum is exploring all avenues in a quest to become a community focal point.\nThe transformation started with a renovation to the building on the Portland Community College Rock Creek campus in 2007. A year later, the board of directors hired interim director Sam Shogren with a mission for the museum to offer a more diverse array of programs and events incorporating art, culture and history.\nThe Washington County Historical Society and Museum then became the Washington County Museum.\nWith the help of Shogren and consultant, Susan Suran, community interviews and surveys were conducted to get an understanding of the people the museum serves.\n\"Really what's driving the transformation is recognition by the board of the transformation in Washington County,\" Shogren said.\nIncreasing minority populations is a reason behind programs like the Latino Mobile Museum – a traveling exhibit that aims to teach local children about the history of Latinos in the county, he said.\nIn July, the museum officially partnered with Print Arts Northwest, which was struggling to survive. In what PAN interim director Barbara Mason calls a \"natural\" partnership, the lobby of the museum was converted into an art gallery for monthly exhibits. Now on the third Thursday of each month, the community is invited to sip wine at exhibit openings.\nThe museum hosts Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts two Saturdays a month and holds a Crossroads Lecture on regional and cultural history every third Wednesday.\nShogren said museum visitation has increased since his arrival. In 2008, 1,666 visitors walked through the museum doors and so far, 2,455 people have visited this year.In September, the first free Family Day lured in more than 200 people, who Shogren said came from all throughout the Portland metro area. The monthly Family Day events are being funded in part by a grant from the PGE Foundation.\nMuseum membership has also increased in the past year, in fact, it's doubled, he said. As of Jan. 1, the museum had 118 members. Eight months later, that number jumped to 314 members, Shogren said.\nAnd those members are donating more money than ever before.\nShogren said he's seen a significant portion of members who donated between $30 and $50 last year bump up their gift to the \"supporter\" level to $100 or more.\nLast year, members donated a total of $1,252 to support the annual gala and with just a few days before this year's event kicks off, donations have already reached $4,470, he said.\n\"Despite the economy, our members are making a bigger investment in the museum,\" Shogren said.\nTickets are selling well for Saturday's annual benefit, featuring Oregon State University basketball Coach Craig Robinson acting as master of ceremonies.\nProceeds from of the gala titled \"A Swank Affair: Lights, Camera, Action!\" which is sponsored by Reser's Fine Foods, will help finance the museum's educational programs and events.\nWith tickets priced at $150 a person and $270 a couple, the museum's programs should also be fairing well.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T23:22:10Z","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/2009/10/washington_county_museum_remak.html"}

{"text":"March 30, 2007: While the users of suicide bombers may not have noticed, the track record of such tactics shows that it doesn't work. In fact, this particular weapon actually backfires. Consider the facts.\nThe Tamil separatists of Sri Lanka (the LTTE) pioneered the modern use of suicide bombers over twenty years ago. The LTTE was particularly effective at attacking senior politicians and security officials. But each attack just made their opponents angrier. The LTTE is now being defeated, partly by an enraged Sri Lankan population, and partly dissention and demoralization within their own ranks.\nHizbollah was the next to pick up on suicide bombers. While Hizbollah claims to represent the Shia minority in Lebanon, it has brought itself increasing resistance from the majority of Lebanese by acting in support for foreign nations. Actually, Hizbollah has largely abandoned suicide bombing, apparently noting the downside of the tactic.\nPalestinian terrorists adopted the use of suicide bombing against Israel in 2000. The Israelis eventually developed tactics that defeated this weapon, The Palestinian attacks destroyed the substantial support within Israel for a Palestinian peace deal, and increased support for stronger measures against Palestinian terrorism. The Palestinian terrorists are still at it, although many Palestinians admit that the tactic has failed, and been counterproductive.\nAl Qaeda also adopted suicide bomber tactics, particularly in Iraq. This turned out to be a major error. So many Moslems were killed, particularly women and children, that Arab public opinion turned against al Qaeda. Even Sunni Arabs in Iraq have been fighting al Qaeda, despite the fact that al Qaeda is committing all this mayhem in the name of Sunni Arabs.\nAl Qaeda began using suicide bombers in Pakistan four years ago, and were promptly taken apart by an enraged Pakistani government, with much public support. This, despite many Islamic conservatives in the government. Al Qaeda was largely driven out of most of Pakistan, and confined to the tribal areas along the Afghan border. Here, the Taliban had a lot of influence, and al Qaeda has convinced the Taliban to support a suicide bomber campaign in Afghanistan. In the last six months there have been nearly 80 suicide bombing attacks in Afghanistan, over fifty percent more than in the previous six months. This campaign has been even less successful than previous ones. The Taliban do not have the experienced support personnel (bomb makers and bomber handlers) to make most of the attacks successful by any measure. Meanwhile, most of the victims are Afghan civilians. Naturally, Afghans see these foreigners (Afghans are difficult to recruit as suicide bombers) as murderers who do not have Afghan interests at heart.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T06:48:57Z","url":"https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htterr/articles/20070330.aspx"}
{"text":"Many in the media and tech industry see Uber’s decision to sell its Chinese business unit to rival Didi Chuxing as a failure for the U.S. ride-hailing giant. It’s easy to believe that the sale of Uber China’s operations to its closest rival is a face-saving exercise, an inevitable outcome for a U.S. company that tried to beat the odds and succeed in China.\nBut the more you chew over the finer points of the deal, the more it looks like an astute piece of business for both parties.\nDon’t believe that this deal was created in haste. The rumor of a merger had been circulating for a month — with both sides denying it — and one source close to negotiations told TechCrunch that the two parties had tried to engineer a deal two previous times without success. So it was third time lucky but, more importantly, ongoing discussions suggest that this is more than Uber saving face — this is an alliance.\nLikewise, don’t believe that Didi acted out of kindness. Didi showed it can raise capital easily when it closed a colossal $7.3 billion funding round that even included money from Apple. It could have let Uber continue to spend billions in China and wither, but it wanted to remove its threat from China and perhaps elsewhere. This was two-way; not merely a tactical Uber exit.\nSo, how does the deal play out?\nFirstly, and most obviously, Uber swaps its capital-intensive business unit in China that its own CEO said was costing it $1 billion per year, for a (potentially) near-20 percent stake in the country’s dominant ride-sharing company, valued at $35 billion. That’s a near-11 fold increase on Didi’s valuation when it was formed by a merger in 2015.\nBut there’s certain to be a lot more growth.\nEarlier this summer, Li Zijian, senior director for international strategy at Didi, estimated that his company is taking just 1.1 percent of China’s taxi market. China’s new regulations, which will legalize Uber and Didi from November, combined with this merger are sure to mean that Didi’s business grows multiples more — all with Uber as its largest single shareholder.\nThat stake not only allows Uber to move towards a much-anticipated IPO by removing the China cash burn from its balance sheet, but it is likely to be a very lucrative holding in a business with vast potential to grow. Even if Didi has so far denied reports of IPO plans of its own.\nThere are some who argue that Uber could have saved time and money and simply invested in Didi earlier if it wanted this kind of financial return potential. For one thing, it would have needed to choose between Didi Kuaidi and Didi Dache, which eventually merged. But, more than that, it is foolish to believe that Didi Chuxing would have grown into the company that it is today without rivalry from Uber.\nUber, for example, pioneered peer-to-peer in China when it introduced People’s Uber in late 2014. It hadn’t been done before at scale. Didi was unprepared and late to the party, introducing its take on the service some six months later. The company started out working exclusively with licensed taxis, and this example shows that competition with Uber clearly sharpened its business and helped shape its growth.\nThe real negative here looks to be for Didi’s allies: Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.\nThe four companies formed a coalition, dubbed the ‘Anti-Uber Alliance’, last year for business synergies such as enabling users to roam between services when they travel, and sharing know-how. Alongside that, Didi made investments in its three allies: putting $100 million in Lyft, and contributing undisclosed minority amounts to Ola’s $500 million round last year, and Grab’s most recent $350 million raise one year ago.\nWhile it often seemed like a PR play, the coalition does give Didi’s cohorts solidarity and support, and likely increased confidence to investors, all of which is important when you are battling a global giant like Uber, which is seemingly capable of raising billions in fresh funding on a whim.\nWell, that alliance looks uncertain at best, or messy at worst, following Uber’s deal with Didi.\nNot only has Didi struck a deal with the sworn enemy and given it a sizable chunk of its business, but it made an undisclosed investment in Uber’s global business which Bloomberg pegged at $1 billion. That’s a drop in the ocean for Uber given the numbers it has raised, but, if the figure is correct, then that investment is multiples larger than the money Didi put into its fellow alliance members.\nNot only that, but Uber CEO Travis Kalanick will sit on the Didi board, no less, while Didi Chairman Cheng Wei will join the Uber board.\nMany, including yours truly, saw the alliance and those Didi investments as a possible first step to acquisitions to expand Didi overseas as and when it saw fit. But this deal with Uber throws all of that into contention. Who is to say that, in Southeast Asia, for example, Didi will back Grab with any vigor now that it is also aligned with Uber. It could let the market play out and then befriend the company that wins.\nThat’s a hypothetical scenario, of course, but it was unthinkable prior to yesterday.\nGrab was bullish on the news, with CEO Anthony Tan coming out positively before the deal was even confirmed. Tan said in a company-wide memo that we obtained that Uber’s exit was proof a regional rival could defeat Uber.\n“They’ve lost once, and we will make them lose again,” he told his staff.\nFighting words indeed, but the conditions that forced Uber’s exit from China simply don’t exist in Southeast Asia which weakens the comparison. The subsidies war is almost certainly multiples more modest than China, and Uber is only just getting round to putting the pedal to the floor in the region.\nWhile Tan publicly rallied his troops, you’d imagine that he was privately disappointed at the way this incident has played out.\nLyft, for one, was more measured with its comment on the Uber-Didi deal.\nOla of India declined multiple requests to comment publicly on the deal.\nIt’ll take some time before the smoke clears and we understand more about how this deal impacts the global ride-sharing economy, but right now it looks like Uber is sitting a lot prettier than many people believe.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T18:27:02Z","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/ubers-deal-with-didi-is-a-win-win-for-everyone-except-the-anti-uber-alliance/"}

I am even lucky enough to find these spaces on rare and miraculous occasions, it’s how I continue to know there is a holy presence in the world.\nIn this blog, it is my fervent hope to think with you about what it means to live faithfully as a Progressive Christian in the world today.

Wilks told his staff during a meeting that he expected to be fired before the Cardinals later made it official, a source told NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport.\nDuring a news conference Monday, team owner Michael Bidwill said he has \"a lot of confidence\" in general manager Steve Keim, who echoed his boss's sentiments.\n\"I have confidence in myself to get this turned around,\" Keim said.\nThe expectation that Wilks would be one-and-done escalated in recent weeks as the Cardinals fell to 3-13.\nArizona owned the worst offense in the NFL in Wilks' first season, ranking last in points per game (14.1), total yards per game (241.6), passing yards per game (157.7) and rushing yards per game (83.9). Wilks fired offensive coordinator Mike McCoy midway through the season, but still, the struggles remained. Perhaps one of the coach's biggest mistakes was hiring a retread like McCoy in the first place.\nIf it was only the offense that took a step back with rookie quarterback Josh Rosen going through growing pains, perhaps a dismal first season could have been overlooked. However, Wilks' defense also cratered. The Cards' run defense went from allowing 89.6 yards per game and 12 rush TDs in 2017 to 154.9 yards per tilt and 25 rush TDs in 2018.\nWorse still were the reports from Arizona that players didn't play hard for Wilks and appeared to give up when the going got tough. If a head coach can't motivate players, his goose is cooked.\nWilks becomes the first one-and-done coach since Chip Kelly was fired by the San Francisco 49ers in 2016.\nThe 49-year-old Wilks should not find trouble landing a defensive coordinator gig should he so choose. Perhaps a return to Carolina, where Ron Rivera fired his DC this season, could be in order.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T23:03:04Z","url":"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001006460/printable/steve-wilks-fired-by-cardinals-after-one-year-with-team"}

The most common natural tests (A/B testing and field/diary studies) and near-natural tests (first-click tests and eye-tracking tests)— are intended to understand user behavior and attitudes as close as possible to reality.\nIn an A/B test, different groups of participants are presented with two choices or variations of an element. As explained in The Guide to Usability Testing, these are generally scientific tests, where only one variable differs, while the rest are controlled. Mostly conducted with websites to test if a certain layout, placement, or messaging will result in better conversions, A/B testing is considered a natural test because users are not notified nor provided a set of tasks.\nCall to actions — This piece by Hubspot explains how Friendbuy more than doubled their response rate to their CTAs using A/B tests.\nHeadlines — In this A/B test, it was discovered that a single line of text for headlines increased signups by 38 percent compared to longer ones.\nForms — A unique style of form field input, the “Mad Libs” style, has been proven to increase conversions by 25-40 percent.\nPricing and promotional offers — Another A/B case study shows explicitly stating “it’s free” increased sign-up conversions by 28 percent.\nImages on landing and product pages — A specific study involving A/B tests shows the surprising impact of using a human photo on conversion rates.\nAmount of text/pages — show that users prefered a single-page checkout by 21.8 percent.\nThere are also other usability testing tools like Optimizely (great for everything) and Unbounce (more landing page focused) that make it extremely easy to get started with A/B testing. These usability tools handle the distribution and collection of data for you, so all you have to do is wait for the results. If you’re interested in a comprehensive list of website elements to test, you can also check out this detailed explanation of 71 things to A/B test.\nRun both variations at the same time — Time is a control, so doing version A first and then version B later may skew the results. Running both tests simultaneously and evenly will ensure the most accurate results.\nTest with enough people for statistical significance— As shown with this sample size calculator, you should test each variation with enough people for a 95 percent significance rate.\nTest new users — Regular users will be confused if they see a new variation, especially if you ultimately choose not to use it. Plus, there’s the mere-exposure effect, in which people prefer what they’re used to.\nBe consistent with variations on all pages — For example, if you are testing the placement of a call to action that appears on multiple pages, a visitor should see the same variation everywhere. Inconsistency will detract from accurate results, so don’t show variation A on page one and variation B on page two.\nTailor your test length to statistical significance — Cancelling the test too early will reduce accuracy. Decide your statistical significance, then you can use this test duration calculator to get a rough timeline. Many paid online usability tools (especially Optimizely) also have a feature for calculating optimum time based on the goals.\nTo see some of these best practices put to use, check out this site containing hundreds of free A/B test case studies. Hubspot also provides a highly visual and easily digestible 27-page guide to A/B testing.\nIn the late 2000s, Dr. Bob Bailey, UX Designer and Researcher, conducted a series of studies around what he called the “first click” concept. The results of the studies were surprising, and very advantageous to anyone looking to improve their website. As it turns out, for any given task, a user’s success rate is 87 percent as long as their first click is correct. If their first click was not correct, the chances for success fell to below 50 percent.\nThis type of usability testing is even more relevant if your site gets a large volume of search traffic — because your homepage probably won’t be the first page users find, first click testing should ideally be done across your entire site.\nWe would consider this a “near-natural” test because users are still assigned tasks (instead of just using the site for whatever purpose they please), but these tests are usually unmoderated and ran remotely in the comfort of the user’s home.\nThe test itself is simple, and can be conducted with online testing tools like Chalkmark by Optimal Workshop. The software presents the user with a screenshot and a task, and then records their first click. For example, as we discuss in User Testing & Design, we asked users to find a local mechanic on Yelp and found that 24 percent of them first clicked on the Search bar (suggesting that the existing information architecture may not be clear enough).\nWrite clear task scenarios — Just like you would for a scripted usability test, make sure the participant is thinking about how to solve a problem instead of just where to click. Detail isn’ required, but clarity is.\nDefine the best paths to success — Start from the homepage and plot all possible paths that will correctly accomplish each task.\nTime each task — A 90 percent first click rate on the correct label might deceptively indicate that your navigation is effective, unless you timed the test and saw it took an average of three minutes to make that first click.\nMeasure user confidence — After each task, you can ask participants to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 regarding their confidence of task completion. Any 3s and 4s will indicate navigation problems.\nFor more information on how a first click test might help, the customer experience newsletter Neo Insight wrote about the three biggest usability problems that first click testing can help solve.\nIt doesn’t get more “natural” than field and diary studies. Both are designed to observe a user as they behave naturally, without the interference of a testing process. The beauty of these tests is that the user never leaves their natural environment and are encouraged to act normally. The difference between the two is that field studies involve an observer going on location, and diary studies involve the participant recording their own thoughts, feelings, and opinions.\nA field study provides data you can’t find anywhere else by letting you observe users in their own environment. Jared M. Spool, Founder of User Interface Engineering, believes that while standard usability tests can lead to valuable insights, the most powerful tool in the toolbox is the field study.\nWitness real user behavior in their everyday lives — In an interview setting, a user may not be aware of how they behave or how they would talk about a product in their everyday lives. However, in the field study, these behaviors are witnessed without a need for explanation.\nUnderstand the context for decisionmaking— Users aren’t always aware of how external factors, like timing for example, affect their decisions. Field studies mark the times and environments of the user, and their impact can be seen during the analysis of the data, even if the user themselves doesn’t know.\nScope out the competition — By observing how the user interacts with different products, you can start to notice similarities and differences, which will flesh out your data to enormous degrees.\nThe biggest downside is primarily the cost of organization and time required (they can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months). Workers have to leave the office for large periods of time, plus scheduling these studies can be troublesome.\nHowever, if you still think field studies could help with your usability goals, take a look at this helpful list of tips from the Nielsen Norman Group, and you can also follow this process for field research that helped companies like Apple, Yahoo, DirecTV, and others.\nA less-involved study of a user in their natural environment is the diary study. In this study, participants are asked to keep a diary and account for their experiences with a type of product or system. As Carine Lallemand, Researching Engineer and UX Scientist, explains in her piece for User Experience Magazine, the diary study is similar to surveys and interviews, yet is distinguished by its length and depth of user-generated research.\nA diary study captures the expectations, mindsets, moods, and social contexts that affect the user experience. A diary study might reveal that a bad mood or criticism read on the web impacted the user’s assessment of the product experience, independent of the product itself.\nLet’s say that you’re asked to improve a web application that helps product managers track progress. You could provide tape recorders and/or journals to five product managers and ask them to document anything odd or frustrating they experienced when using the application. After a few weeks, you would analyze the data and make specific recommendations.\nSignificance of participant — The quality of results depends on the quality of the participant. Because this takes a good deal of effort on their part, the participant’s commitment to the project influences the outcome whether positively or negatively. On top of that, the participant’s self-awareness, self-expression, and writing skill can all sway the results.\nTraining sessions — While it may sound like the participant acts independently, the truth is that a thorough training session is necessary to ensure the participant understands exactly what is expected before starting.\nAnalysis — The analysis of an entire diary is time-consuming, especially if it is hand-written.\nInclude contextual and open-ended questions in the writing prompt — Contextual questions like, “What prompted you to use the app?” give you direct insight, but open-ended questions like, “What would you have done differently in this situation?” can uncover new solutions.\nLet users decide how to record themselves — Text, online photo galleries, voice recording, even Twitter can all work. It also helps the process feel more natural and makes participants less self-conscious.\nKeep size in mind — The diary (whatever form) can be as small or large as needed. On paper, space for forty entries can be overwhelming, while ten might be more encouraging. That’s also why digital methods might be better since users can use as much space as they want.\nFor a more detailed explanation, complete with hypothetical examples, check out this extensive post by UserTesting and this list of Dos and Don’ts.\nWhile diary and field studies let you see the context for how and why products are used in everyday life, an eye tracking test goes into almost microscopic detail.\nAn eye tracking test is just as it sounds, tracking a user’s eye movement, and more to the point where specifically they are looking. The eye tracking test is usually done in a lab environment in which hardware tracks eye movement, while heat mapping remotely tracks where users click (through software like CrazyEgg).\nUsers are predictable — As we can see by the eye tracking patterns above, people’s sight follows similar trends, allowing us to plan our visual layouts for the masses. In Web UI Best Practices, we explain how to lay out a site in accordance to the popular F pattern and Z patterns.\nUsers search pages differently depending on goals — A user’s eye pattern will differ depending on why they are searching a screen; for example, browsing and searching for something in particular have two different modes.\nUsers are drawn to visuals — Visuals like thumbnails or vibrant colors will attract a user’s attention more than plain text, so use this accordingly.\nPeople ignore ads — In a phenomenon that Jakob Nielson calls “banner blindness,” people will neglect ads habitually, so online advertisers will have to work harder.\nUnconventional products cause confusion — Being creative with the color of a link or the placement of your menu may set you apart from other sites, but it will also take the user longer to figure out how to use your product, which can be risky.\nIf you’re interested in using eye tracking to help your website, it’s a lot more achievable than it might seem. This instructive guide will explain how you can make eye tracking work for you. If you’re more interested in a more natural test, SumoMe explains how to run a heat map study based on over 1,000,000 tests that they’ve run.\nTests that observe the users in their natural (or near-natural) environments provide a specific type of data that other, more controlled tests can’t access. An A/B test lets you make decisions that are informed by more thorough and statistically significant results (since you have a huge sample size).\nSimilarly, field and diary studies can provide you with unique information about your target users — namely external factors such as timing, environment, mood, etc. — that more direct card sorting or tree testing cannot.\nAs for first click and eye tracking tests, they literally let you see your website as your users do, but make sure you run other types of tests for the right context. While each of the different test types has its own advantages and disadvantages, sometimes its best to mix-and-match them to achieve results more specific to you.\nFor explanations and practical tips for 30 different types of usability tests, check out the free 109-page Guide to Usability Testing.

{"text":"Hackers extracted lists of files from computers that they contaminated with the virus that triggered cyberattacks last week in the United States and South Korea, police in Seoul said Tuesday.\nThe attacks, in which floods of computers tried to connect to a single Web site at the same time to overwhelm the server, caused outages on prominent government-run sites in both countries.\nThe finding means that hackers not only used affected computers for Web attacks, but also attempted to steal information from them. That adds to concern that contaminated computers were ordered to damage their own hard disks or files after the Web assaults.\nStill, the new finding does not mean information was stolen from attacked Web sites, such as those of the White House and South Korea's presidential Blue House, police said. It also does not address suspicions about North Korea's involvement, they said.\nPolice reached those conclusions after studying a malicious computer code in an analysis of about two dozen computers - a sample of the tens of thousands of computers that were infected with the virus that triggered the attacks, said An Chan-soo, a senior police officer investigating the cyberattacks. The officer said that only lists of files were extracted, not files themselves.\n\"It's like hackers taking a look inside the computers,\" An said. \"We're trying to figure out why they did this.\"\nExtracted file lists were sent to 416 computers in 59 countries, 15 of them in South Korea. Police have found some file lists in 12 receiver computers and are trying to determine whether hackers broke into those systems and stole the lists, An said.\nInvestigators have yet to identify the hackers or determine for sure where they operated from. Dozens of high-profile U.S. and South Korean Web sites were targeted.\nThere have been no new Web attacks since the last wave launched Thursday evening.\nSouth Korea's spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, lowered the country's cyberattack alert Monday as affected Web sites returned to normal.\nNorth Korea is suspected of involvement. The spy agency told lawmakers last week that a North Korean military research institute had been ordered to destroy the South's communications networks, local media reported.\nThe agency said in a statement Saturday that it has \"various evidence\" of North Korean involvement, but cautioned it has yet to reach a final conclusion.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T10:56:27Z","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/s-korea-hackers-got-data-in-cyberattacks/"}

The ouster came after months of public protests demanding al-Bashir’s resignation. The military’s chief of staff also stepped down from his post Friday. Protesters celebrated the news and mounted calls for the creation of a civilian transitional council, rejecting the military’s proposal to lead a two-year pre-election transition period.\nMeanwhile, the United Nations has called on Sudanese authorities to release anyone arrested for demonstrating against the government. It also called on Sudan to cooperate with the International Criminal Court , which issued an arrest warrant in 2005 for ousted leader al-Bashir over possible war crimes.

{"text":"MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - As our world continues to advance with the help of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has generated a lot of buzz lately in healthcare. AI healthcare providers share the goal of treating more patients, cutting down the cost of healthcare, and ultimately aim to achieve better outcomes.\nArtificial intelligence in the healthcare industry uses human-created algorithms through a computer-driven system to break down complex medical data, and helps with decision support around treatment. Healthcare providers can then easily sift through large amounts of data to identify infections sooner, improve preventative medicine and enhance diagnostics. Results from an Accenture report estimated that AI applications in healthcare could save up to $150 billion annually for the U.S. healthcare economy by 2026.\nLocal hospitals like Conway Medical Center are already using forms of AI in their electronic medical records, such as a sepsis monitoring system used to alert doctors and nurses. With these advancements in the healthcare industry, doctors say it can reduce human error and boost overall outcomes.\n“It can be a second set of eyes. The other thing you have to look at too is when we’re looking at big data. We can have computers that can read thousands of studies in seconds,\" said Dr. Paul Richardson, chief medical officer at Conway Medical Center.\nIn the next few months, Richardson says Conway Medical Center will launch robotic surgery in several departments. The robots will still have a human touch - surgeons will be able to direct movements of the robot, resulting in faster recovery times and fewer risks. Additionally, in the next few weeks, the hospital will launch a 3T MRI scanner, which Richardson says is a higher resolution MRI that will allow staff to conduct high-tech imaging studies.\n“My hope for the future is - our number one goal is to deliver the best healthcare to each patient every time, and if we can utilize or leverage technology to do that, then I think we’re all the better for it,\" said Richardson.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T01:02:19Z","url":"http://www.wmbfnews.com/2019/02/14/conway-medical-center-weighs-artificial-intelligence-healthcare/"}

{"text":"▪ The wine salesperson on the floor might actually have tasted the wines and be able to point out intelligently which ones are fit for tonight’s dinner and which ones should be socked away.\n▪ Some wine critics note or imply whether a wine be drunk now or held.\n▪ Other hints for telling whether a wine is best consumed now or is meant to age: Screwcaps indicate a wine is intended for early consumption, while corks indicate that the wine should be aged. Also, the lower the alcohol the more likely the wine should be drunk young. Furthermore, price can be a guide; the higher it is, the longer the wine likely will age, or at least that’s the implication. There are, however, enough exceptions to these guidelines to send consumers back to the advice of a knowing wine merchant.\nWhat put me in mind of two types of gold-medal sticker was a class of cabernet sauvignons our panel judged at the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition in Cloverdale earlier this year. There were 66 of them, all priced between $39 and $43. Yes, we were lucky, for cabernets in that price niche should be models of varietal typicity, energy, balance and length. We gave 16 of them gold or double-gold medals, the latter being granted when all judges of a panel agree that a wine merits gold.\nLe Casque Wines 2012 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($40): Get this: Our best-of-class cabernet sauvignon came from Le Casque Wines in little ol’ Loomis. While Le Casque is identified largely with varietal wines and blends based on Rhone Valley grape varieties grown in the Sierra foothills, owner-winemaker Kevin Stevenson knows where to go for cabernet sauvignon, and that’s Napa Valley. The result is a 2012 that comes down proudly and expressively on the herbal side of the cabernet spectrum, a well-proportioned throwback to the days when Napa Valley cabernets could be drunk immediately as well as laid down to age handsomely.\nEcluse Wines 2013 Paso Robles Lock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon ($40): For its silken texture and seductive cherry flavor, this entry won a rare spontaneous double-gold medal. Usually, a double-gold is a negotiated medal; that is, a panelist who thought it warranted silver but not gold had to be persuaded of the wine’s grandeur. With this elegant and balanced interpretation there was no question that it deserved gold.\nDeWitt Family Wines 2012 Sonoma County Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($42): Cabernet sauvignon out of Alexander Valley long has been recognized for its dark lush fruit, supple tannins and graceful presentation, characteristics captured here in a readily accessible representative. It was one of six double-gold medal winners in the class.\nSpeedy Creek Winery 2013 Knights Valley Speedy Creek Cabernet Sauvignon ($40): After a stretch of especially rigid cabernets during the judging, this entry was embraced not only for its vivid fruit but its tangy acidity, modest tannins and all-around drinkability.\nHood Crest Winery 2013 Columbia Valley Waving Tree Cabernet Sauvignon ($42): From northern Oregon comes a cabernet that while lithe in build nonetheless is hung with ample sweet fruit that is welcoming at first sip and refuses to give up its embrace until long after the last swallow.\nBoatique Winery 2012 Lake County Red Hills Cabernet Sauvignon ($40): This is why the volcanic soils of the Red Hills rising from the west shore of Clear Lake are generating so much buzz – a cabernet sauvignon complex, graceful and persistent, with a note of sarsaparilla and the kind of firm tannic build that will have it drinking best in five or so years.\nLongboard Vineyard 2013 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon ($42): In my notes, I call this “a conversation piece,” code for a certain alluring eccentricity. It won’t be everyone’s cup of cabernet sauvignon, primarily for its young stiffness and brooding attitude, but lurking behind all that is fresh dark fruit, spice, silk and a lingering finish, all of which is bound to build upon itself with a few years in the cellar.\nVina Moda 2013 Sierra Foothills Cabernet Sauvignon ($40): Though gold-medal cabernets out of the Sierra foothills are rare, and double-gold medals even more rare, which this was, the Vina Moda won over the panel for its faithful juiciness, insinuations of tea and complications of earthiness and oak. It’s hard right now, but should continue to evolve into a wine of suppleness and balance.\nV. Sattui Winery 2012 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($39): V. Sattui is recognized for wines faithful to breeding, accessibility and value, and while this cherry- and oak-saturated release can be enjoyed right now with appropriately marbled beef, it should evolve into a more open take on the genre with a few years of age.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T16:36:02Z","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/food-drink/wine/dunne-on-wine/article82089737.html"}

The handset will go on sale in July -- not an ideal time of year to use a projector, with all that pesky daylight about, but there you are. At least it'll be a good test for Samsung's 15 lumens projector-in-a-phone.\nLuke went hands-on with the Beam out at MWC, so have a read of what he thought here, or watch his preview video below.\nThe Beam shoots out images at up to 50 inches across, so you can have the equivalent of a very large telly in your pocket wherever you go. It's HD too. You control the projector through a dedicated app on the 4-inch, 480x800-pixel screen. On the back is a 5-megapixel camera, and it'll record and playback movies in 720p HD at 30fps.\nSoftware-wise, we're looking at Android 2.3 Gingerbread as opposed to Ice Cream Sandwich, so you won't be able to unlock it with facial recognition, or resize your widgets. On board storage is 8GB, but you can add another 32GB via microSD. And a 1GHz dual-core processor powers the phone.\nThe projector makes the handset a little fatter than most, and has undoubtedly bumped up the price as well. It's cheaper than the HTC One X, for example, but a lot less powerful.\nThough it may seem quite innovative, Samsung actually demoed the Beam back in 2010, when it was just a protoype.\nWe're still pounding the halls at Mobile World Congress, so for everything mobile check out mwc.cnet.co.uk.

{"text":"\"We are going (to Michigan) with a lot more confidence, because we ran well there last year,\" Earnhardt said. \"I looked through the notes from last year, and we didn't unload perfect. We had to work to get it right. You don't go in with confidence that you are going to go there, and it will be perfect. You have the confidence to know that we will get it dialed in.\"\nWhen the series competed at Michigan in June 2012, it was the first time on the track's new pavement. The repaving began after the August 2011 race and concluded in November, giving the asphalt enough time to settle and cure during the winter months. The new surface on this 2-mile track produced record speeds. Marcos Ambrose won the pole at Michigan one year ago when he easily shattered the track qualifying record with a lap at 203.241 mph. Forty drivers in that qualifying session posted a faster speed than the previous track record of 194.232 mph, set by Ryan Newman in 2005. Nineteen drivers topped 200 mph.\nHowever, teams were faced with a huge tire issue in the days leading up to the race. Several teams experienced tire blistering during Friday's practice session as well as on the extra day of practice on Thursday. NASCAR and Goodyear made the decision to use a tougher left-side tire for the race. The higher than expected speeds at Michigan caused significantly higher left-side tire temperatures and therefore blistering.\nAn additional practice was held the day before the race. Teams had 75 minutes to familiarize themselves with the new tires and make further adjustments to their race setups. Earnhardt Jr. was one of those drivers who was limited on his practice time due to engine concerns. He complained that his car wasn't as good as he wanted it to be after completing just 26 laps in the last practice.\nBut Earnhardt put on a dominating performance in the 400-mile event. He led a total of 95 laps and crossed the finish line ahead of his closest competitor, Tony Stewart, by more than 5 seconds for his 19th career Sprint Cup victory.\nRight now, Earnhardt sits fourth in the point standings. He moved up two positions after his top-five run at Pocono.\n\"We have been carrying momentum for a good solid year now,\" he said. \"We are alright, and we know what we need to do.\"\nEarnhardt trails leader and Hendrick teammate Jimmie Johnson by 82 points. Johnson claimed his third win of the season at Pocono, placing him in a tie with Matt Kenseth for most victories in the series this year.\nMichigan is one of five tracks on the current Sprint Cup schedule where Johnson has yet to win. Chicagoland, Homestead, Kentucky and Watkins Glen are the others.\nLast June at Michigan, Johnson nearly ran out of gas but managed to pull off a fifth-place finish. But that was followed by a 27th-place result in August due to engine failure just before the finish.\n\"The Michigan track surface has had summer and winter on it, and we'll see how much grip is just in the surface,\" Johnson said. \"I would assume we'll go as fast as we did (last year) if not faster, and with the flatter track, I think the Gen-6 (new Sprint Cup race car) will outperform the Gen-5. The question really comes down to how much grip is still in the asphalt. I would assume it's going to be high.\n\"On fresh repaves, the grip is always at its highest. I'm not exactly sure how that will play out, but I'm happy that a summer and a winter have been on the track. It will make the racing wider for us, and that's what we're all hoping for. We've had weird things happen at Michigan, but one of these times it (a win) will happen for us. I hope it's this year.\"\nGreg Biffle won the most recent Sprint Cup race at Michigan last August. Biffle is coming off a season-best second-place finish at Pocono. He is now 10th in points.\n\"I couldn't be happier coming off the run at Pocono going into Michigan,\" Biffle said. \"We finished fourth the first race and got a win there last year at Michigan. We are working hard on our cars, trying to get them better, but we still have a little work to do.\n\"Michigan is one of my favorite tracks. It's a big fast place and has lots of room to race. We can get strung out a bit, but there is always something going on, someone is always catching someone else. There is always a lot of strategy going on. Fuel mileage and pit stops are very important. I've had a lot of success at Michigan in the past, and I think this will be a good weekend for us.\"\nForty-four teams are on the preliminary entry list for the Quicken Loans 400. A.J. Allmendinger and Bobby Labonte will switch rides for this race.

{"text":"Insight: Did Conficker help sabotage Iran's nuke program?\n(Reuters) - A cyber warfare expert claims he has linked the Stuxnet computer virus that attacked Iran’s nuclear program in 2010 to Conficker, a mysterious “worm” that surfaced in late 2008 and infected millions of PCs.\nConficker was used to open back doors into computers in Iran, then infect them with Stuxnet, according to research from John Bumgarner, a retired U.S. Army special-operations veteran and former intelligence officer.\nWhile it is widely believed that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet, Bumgarner wouldn’t comment on whether he believes the Americans and Israelis also unleashed Conficker, one of the most virulent pieces of so-called malware ever detected. He wouldn’t name the attackers he believes were behind the two programs, saying the matter was too sensitive to discuss.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, which oversees Israel’s intelligence agencies, also declined comment.\nIf Bumgarner’s findings, which couldn’t immediately be independently confirmed, are correct then it shows that the United States and Israel may have a far more sophisticated cyber-warfare program than previously thought. It could also be a warning to countries other than Iran that they might be vulnerable to attacks.\nHis account leaves unresolved several mysteries. These include the severity of the damage that the program inflicted on Iran’s uranium enrichment facility, whether other facilities in Iran were targeted and the possibility that there were other as yet unidentified pieces of malware used in the same program.\nBumgarner - who wrote a highly praised analysis of Russia’s 2008 cyber assault on Republic of Georgia - says he identified Conficker’s link to Stuxnet only after spending more than a year researching the attack on Iran and dissecting hundreds of samples of malicious code.\nHe is well regarded by some in the security community. “He is a smart man,” said Tom Kellermann, an advisor to the Obama Administration on cyber security policy and the chief technology officer of a company called AirPatrol.\nThe worm’s latent state had been a mystery for some time. It appears never to have been activated in the computers it infected, and security experts have speculated that the program was abandoned by those who created it because they feared getting caught after Conficker was subjected to intense media scrutiny.\nIf confirmed, Bumgarner’s work could deepen understanding of how Stuxnet’s commanders ran the cyber operation that last year sabotaged an underground facility at Natanz, where Iranian scientists are enriching uranium using thousands of gas centrifuges.\nThe view that Stuxnet was built by the United States and Israel was laid out in a January 2011 New York Times report that said it came from a joint program begun around 2004 to undermine Iran’s efforts to build a bomb. That article said the program was originally authorized by U.S. President George W. Bush, and then accelerated by his successor, Barack Obama.\nThe first reports that the United States and Israel were behind Stuxnet were greeted skeptically. There are still a handful of prominent cyber security experts, including Jeffrey Carr, the author of the book “Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld,” who dispute the U.S.-Israel idea. He says that circumstantial evidence paints a convincing case that China was behind Stuxnet.\nAccording to Bumgarner’s account, Stuxnet’s operators started doing reconnaissance in 2007, using Duqu, which spied on makers of components used in Iran’s nuclear and critical infrastructure facilities.\nIn November 2008, Conficker was let loose and it quickly spread, attacking millions of PCs around the world. Its initial task was to infect a machine and “phone home” with its location. If it was at a strategic facility in Iran, the attackers tagged that PC as a target. The release left millions of untagged machines infected with Conficker around the world, but no damage was done to them.\nIn March 2009, Bumgarner says, the attackers released a new, more powerful version of Conficker that started the next phase of the attack on April 1 by downloading Stuxnet onto the targeted PCs. After it completed that task, Conficker’s mission on those machines was complete.\nHe did more digging, comparing date and time stamps on different versions of Conficker and Stuxnet, and found a correlation — key dates related to their development and deployment overlapped. That helped him identify April Fool’s Day, April 1, 2009, as the launch date for the attack.\nBumgarner believes the attackers picked that date to send a message to Iran’s leaders. It marked the 30th anniversary of the declaration of an Islamic republic by Ayatollah Khomeini after a national referendum.\nOnce Conficker had pulled Stuxnet into computers in Iran there was still one big hurdle, he said. Those infected computers weren’t yet in the target - the underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.\nStuxnet was programmed to automatically jump from an infected PC to a USB drive as soon as it was put into a computer. That was the easy part. Getting somebody to be a human “mule” by bringing that USB drive to Natanz and plugging it into the right machine was a logistical nightmare.\nThat was probably delivered by somebody who regularly visited the facility and had reason to share information electronically - an academic affiliated with an engineering program at one of Iran’s universities or a worker at a company that provided technology to the facility, according to Bumgarner. He or she was almost certainly unaware of what was happening, he said.\n“It blew their operation wide open,” says Bumgarner.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T04:41:48Z","url":"https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE7B10AP20111202"}

{"text":"Khairuldeen Makhzoomi, 26, is a senior at University of California Berkeley. Makhzoomi lives with his mother and younger brother in Oakland. His father was an Iraqi diplomat whom Saddam Hussein jailed in Abu Ghraib prison. The dictator’s regime later killed him.\nOn April 6, Makhzoomi boarded a Southwest Airlines flight at LAX that was headed for Oakland. After boarding, Makhzoomi called an uncle in Baghdad to tell him that he had just heard United Nation Secretary General Ban Ki-moon deliver a speech.\nMakhzoomi told his uncle that he asked the secretary general a question about ISIS. The conversation ended with the Arabic phrase, “inshallah” or god willing.\nA female passenger in a seat nearby overheard the conversation and told the flight crew she heard him making potentially threatening statements.\nThe Southwest employee then escorted him off the plane, and Makhzoomi accused the employee of anti-Muslim bias.\nLaw enforcement officials searched Makhzoomi in the airport terminal in front of a crowd of onlookers, including other officers and a police dog. Three FBI agents then arrived and questioned him in a private room.\nMakhzoomi said an FBI agent told him the Southwest Airlines employee said a passenger reported hearing him talk in Arabic about martyrdom, using a phrase often associated with jihadists. Makhzoomi denied the charge and returned to the terminal where the Arabic-speaking employee refunded his ticket.\nThe Berkeley student booked a new flight on Delta Air Lines and arrived in Oakland eight hours after he had planned. Makhzoomi said he does not plan to pursue legal action, but he wants Southwest Airlines to apologize for the ways its employees treated him.\nZahra Biloo, of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said there have been at least six cases of airlines pulling Muslims off flights so far this year. Southwest Airlines released a statement saying it does not condone or tolerate discrimination of any kind.\nHes a student at Berkeley, where does he get the “refugee” status from? This kid was looking for a reaction and he got it! If I say “bomb” anything close to that on an airplane, I’d assume I’m gonna get some attention and be taken off the plane.\nHe has to pay for his education and he is smart enough to know that someone will do the dirty work for him. Another stunt for today’s reading.\nSouthwest Airlines say it was the CONTENT of the conversation, not that he was speaking Arabic, that he was removed. This guy made the mistake of getting on a plane where a passenger and a flight attendant both spoke Arabic.\nCan at least one of the people who voted this down, please explain why. Should we allow people who by their actions pose a possible threat to continue on the plane. If so, should we allow the other passengers the choice of deboarding at that point. Should the pilot and flight attendants also be allowed to leave. Or do you hate Southwest Airlines and hope for a crash?\nDo you speak Arabic and have a transcript of this student’s conversation? So, you think that he was not a threat or not trying to frighten people so he could get kicked off the plane and sue the airline?\nDo you not realize that Southwest Airlines probably flies more Middle Eastern passengers, (connected with the oil industry) than most airlines–all without incident and apparently has flight attendants who speak Arabic. Or do you just want to believe that Southwest is Islamophobic because it has the word South in its name?\nMore importantly, do you have a transcript? I read the article above, and it did not mention specific language used by the passenger. Therefore, all of the actions you have suggested (passengers and crew leaving) are based on the assumption that this guy said something threatening, without any evidence for it.\nIt is important to have the evidence before weighing in on either side. You and the poster above have failed to take this crucial step.\nCorrection. You are the poster above. You have failed this test twice.\nMaybe he was talking to that clock-kid, getting advice on how to get his 15 minutes of fame?\nThis guy knew exactly what he was doing. He’s looking for a payday.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T00:43:30Z","url":"https://calcoastnews.com/2016/04/iraqi-refugee-taken-off-california-flight/"}

{"text":"Ever since Zillow evolved into.. well, whatever it is now (some sort of real estate search, AVM, mortgage rate and discussion forum Frankenstein Hydra, as far as I can tell), the controversy over Zestimates seems to have quieted down.\nMaybe it’s that the novelty of seeing what your home is worth has worn off as housing prices crash.\nPerhaps it’s that the PR pros at Zillow have done such a phenomenal job positioning the company in the media as a legitimate data source that the Zestimate has become an accepted statistic.\nOr more likely, maybe it’s that the industry has been successfully wooed with the promises of easy, cheap marketing online tools (which are especially seductive in a down market) and any remaining resistance has slipped by the wayside.\nIn either case, Zestimates just don’t seem to be the point of contention they once were.\nBut today Zillow launched an iPhone app. One that, I suspect, promises to bring the debate over Zestimates (and their accuracy) back to the forefront.\nUpfront – it’s a very slick app. The app’s location awareness (as demonstrated on the video embedded above) is truly a killer feature – fire it up, and the app immediately shows you where you are and then displays all the data on homes nearby. As you move around, the map and associated values update too. Freakin’ cool.\n(That said, it was a little sluggish this morning however, not sure if was AT&T’s network or Zillow’s servers struggling to keep up).\nHaving had a chance to play with it a bit – I can vouch that as a potential buyer it is incredibly cool to be able to walk around my neighborhood and see what each home is worth and gauge what I could get for my money.\nSure, I know. A Zestimate is just a “starting point”. But here’s the thing, seeing that number while standing outside the home is a powerful physical association to price. One that as more and more people have access too (through other mobile platforms, see A House They Found on Zillow…) it’s going to start to have a greater impact; on negotiations and much more.\nHaving the power of the Zestimate in your hand is a mighty weapon to wield. Personally I can’t wait to walk into a home on a buying tour with my agent and being able to instantly call up how much Zillow says that home is worth and then compare it to the list price.\nGiven that scenario, I suspect the debate over Zestimates, long dormant – may just have woken up again.\nThe Zillow app is free and available in the App Store.\nMore: Read 1000Watt Consulting’s take on the app.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T12:12:49Z","url":"https://www.inman.com/next/zillow-takes-zestimates-to-the-streets/"}

And, Waynesboro still won by 20.\n\"We keep talking about setting a new bar, because I'm not sure we know exactly how good this team can be,\" Waynesboro coach Tom Hoffman said. \"We can win different ways, which is the exciting part. We weren't at our best tonight, but we'll take it, especially in this environment.\"\nAlthough not prominent in the scoring column, the energy of Derek Buhrman was another decisive difference for the Indians.

His lone field goal in the second half was simply an added bonus to a stellar night.\n\"He does so many winning things for us, he's just invaluable,\" Hoffman said of Buhrman. \"He's our heartbeat.

Ultimately, Waynesboro's wealth of firepower put the game out of reach after the break.\nStill, Friday's effort provides something to build on for a Greencastle squad growing on the fly.\n\"We played our hearts out,\" G-A coach Rick Lewis said. \"We're continuing to improve, and if we play with that kind of effort, I can sleep at night.

{"text":"According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, four out of five car seats in the United States are not installed properly.\nAn important motivation for fostering the growth and development of our community is to make it a better place for our children to grow up. The successes of this community mean nothing if we cannot pay it forward to make a better life for our children. Ultimately, we want to keep them safe as they grow up, and, in today’s world, children are all too often faced with numerous challenges to their safety and health.\nWith all the potential dangers and risks in the world, it may be a surprise to learn that the leading cause of childhood injury and death in the United States is motor vehicle crashes. Not only that, but the percentage of children killed from a motor-vehicle crash is higher on average in South Carolina than it is in other states across the country. If we are truly trying to protect our children and build them a better future, we must keep them safe on the road.\nThe best way to prevent childhood injury or death in these accidents is by what you can control: safe car seats. But, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, four out of five car seats in the United States are not installed properly. Infant and toddler car seats are designed with safety in mind, but a seat that is not installed correctly will not protect the child. Correctly installed car seats can reduce the risk of death by as much as 71 percent for infants and 54 percent for toddlers.\nCar seat safety is a passion for our family. We have been proud to partner with Safe Kids Upstate, a member of Safe Kids Worldwide, to raise awareness of childhood injury prevention here in the Upstate over the past 20 years. Since 1988, when Safe Kids was founded by Dr. Marty Eichelberger, a pediatric trauma surgeon in Washington, D.C., the organization has helped reduce the U.S. childhood death rate from unintentional injury by 60 percent.\nIt’s encouraging that so much progress has been made. But as long as there are new babies, and new parents, there is a need for education and support. Today, Safe Kids Upstate is a part of the Bradshaw Institute for Community Child Health & Advocacy and we are leading the charge locally to create inspection stations where parents can have car seats checked by certified technicians to ensure they are installed correctly.\nThanks to support from Kohl’s, nine inspection stations are available across the Upstate, and we have inspected more than 15,000 car seats. There are Upstate families who have had their seats inspected, experienced an auto accident and, because of their correctly installed seat, the children in the seats did not sustain serious injuries. This direct positive outcome is exactly what we are hoping for with the creation of this program. To find a location near you, visit www.safekidsupstate.org/carseat.\nEarlier this month, we celebrated the opening of a permanent car seat inspection station at Greenville Memorial Hospital. This is the first hospital-based station in South Carolina and is the result of collaboration with several partners, including Kohl’s and Safe Kids Upstate.\nOur hope is that this location will allow new parents to get their car seats inspected before ever leaving the hospital. It will keep children safe from day one, give parents peace of mind and ensure that they begin their parenting journey with knowledge about road safety and injury prevention.\nWe can’t stop accidents from happening on the road, but we can take steps to prevent serious injuries or even fatalities. A correctly installed car seat is a highly effective vaccine against automotive accident injuries. We sincerely hope that Upstate parents will take the time to protect our children.\nWilliam Bradshaw is president and owner of Bradshaw Automotive Group and a leading advocate of child passenger safety. William and his wife, Annette, are the namesakes for GHS’ Bradshaw Institute for Community Child Health & Advocacy, which aims to improve the well-being of all children in S.C. through innovative education and prevention programs, clinical research and academic partnerships.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T22:07:51Z","url":"https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/opinion/2018/04/30/opinion-take-advantage-car-seat-inspection-stations/555391002/"}

I am almost, but not quite, sympathetic to the First Lady. It seems she wore short shorts and what might be charitably described as a casual top.\nAvoiding the appearance of queenly behavior is politically wise. But it does American culture no favors if a first lady tries so hard to be average that she winds up looking common.\nIf the First Lady had not been sold to the American public as a fashion icon, a woman of elegance and grace, and if she had not willingly catered to this claque with bizarre Spider Woman outfits and queasy-making colors and textures juxtaposed, I would truly pity her plight. We all sometimes head out the door with too little thought to how we look.\nBut having made well-publicized shopping sprees in Paris, and willingly catered to the fashion idolatry directed her way for purely political reasons, I think that Mrs. Obama has accepted the mantle of clothing exemplar. It is a crown that will not rest easy on her head.\nI suppose there must be some people who genuinely regard Michelle Robinson Obama as beautiful, elegant, and tasteful. But I am not among them. I have yet to meet a heterosexual male who finds Michelle a hottie.

{"text":"Joseph Thornton, a graduate of Eastside Prep, stands outside of the Meyer Library at Stanford University, where he is busy studying for upcoming finals on December 3, 2013. It is Thornton's first semester at the university. Photo by Veronica Weber.\nJoseph Thornton could have been another statistic.\nAs a sixth grader living in San Francisco with a single father who worked nights, he was on his own a lot of the time, cooking dinners and getting himself to bed.\nBut his public school teacher spotted his unusual work ethic and \"through a blessing and good luck\" introduced him to a private school in East Palo Alto, where he could live in a dorm and get round-the-clock support.\nThornton today is a Stanford University freshman, working at the tech help desk in the undergraduate library, singing in the Black Men's Chorus a cappella group and preparing to declare a major in computer science.\nThough he always aspired to attend college and his father supported the dream, Thornton says without the extraordinary preparation he got in his six years as a student at Eastside College Preparatory School, things might have turned out very differently.\n\"It definitely wouldn't have been the same -- I would have been on my own in the whole process,\" he said.\nNow in its 18th year, Eastside Prep is a one-of-a-kind institution, combining rigorous academics, an uncommon level of teacher and volunteer support and sustained investment by private donors toward a razor-sharp objective: getting first-generation college students to succeed in four-year colleges and beyond.\n\"We believe every student who becomes the first member of his or her family to go to college has a profound impact not just on that student but on the whole family,\" says Principal and co-founder Chris Bischof.\nStarting with that conviction and little else, Bischof and Eastside co-founder and Vice-Principal Helen Kim -- friends from their Stanford undergraduate days in the early 1990s -- have built this unusual school from scratch, learning and adapting along the way.\nThe two teachers had eight students when they launched their startup in 1996 at a park picnic table in East Palo Alto, later moving to borrowed office space and eventually to a few portable classrooms on a donated 1.6-acre parcel on Myrtle Street.\nFrom the picnic-table beginnings, Bischof over the years has corralled donor support to build state-of-the-art classrooms, a computer lab, a theater, a gym, a cafeteria and even a dorm -- all surrounding an open, grassy quad.\nEnrollment has grown to 300 from the original eight, with every one of Eastside's 388 alumni so far accepted by a four-year college.\nEighty-two percent of Eastside students come from East Palo Alto or eastern Menlo Park, though some of those are among the one-third of Eastside students who live in the dorm because of the extra structure and support offered there. Bischof himself has resided on campus for nearly the entire history of the school.\nIt may be only slightly accidental that many amenities available to Eastside students -- hot meals, tutorials, dorm-room inspections -- resemble those at the New England boarding school where Bischof spent his own high school years, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.\n\"There are some common elements, and differences as well,\" said Bischof when asked about the comparison.\n\"We've tried to create a school that has high expectations and is really rigorously going to prepare our students for college across the board. Having been in those environments, it helps to know what those expectations are like. And we hope that with the same expectations and the right type of support, our students can be equally successful.\"\nVice-principal Kim oversees Eastside's faculty and curriculum, including unique features like \"Friday Night Homework\" and an intensive middle-school reading program.\nReceiving no public funds, Eastside is free from the strings and bureaucracy that accompany them, allowing it wide berth to customize teaching to student needs.\nThe flip side is that Bischof must constantly fundraise -- to the tune of $17,000 per student per year -- to keep the operation afloat, a task he calls \"a huge struggle, and a real challenge from year to year.\"\nParents, most of whom are low-income, are asked to pay $250 a year -- plus an extra $100 if their child lives in the dorm -- and contribute 20 volunteer hours.\nWith 55 staff members (38 full-time-equivalents), the school's operating budget is $6.4 million, covering the year-round program, the residential program and the alumni support. It costs $10,000 to house a child in the dorm. Ninety percent of Eastside's support comes from individuals, with the balance from foundations and corporations.\nIn the case of Joseph Thornton and many others who've gone through the school, financial support came from donors who agreed to sponsor an individual student.\nWhile many of his classmates wrote their thank-you letters to anonymous sponsors, Thornton said he felt lucky that his sponsors -- a San Francisco couple with a young daughter who took him on as a seventh-grader -- wanted to get to know him personally.\nThey met for lunches and visits and, the following year, invited Thornton to an event at their home to speak about his Eastside experiences with prospective donors to the school.\n\"It went well actually,\" he said. \"I had a lot of fun, met a lot of people, and did more of it. It's a great experience because you learn how to interact with people of different backgrounds, understand their experiences and understand the whole experience of networking.\"\nThe San Francisco family kept on sponsoring him every year through high school, Thornton said, and the relationship continues today.\nAs word about Eastside has spread, admission inevitably has grown more selective.\nFirst and foremost, says Bischof, the school is looking for first-generation college-bound students from low-income families. \"Within that subset, we're looking for students who want to be here.\"\nStudents must commit to an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. school day -- plus homework -- and an academic calendar that runs year-round, including summer school or other summer activities deemed worthy. Bischof personally interviews every applicant.\n\"They're really looking for that spark in kids,\" said John Jacobs, a retired public school teacher now in his seventh year of volunteering at Eastside.\n\"Not necessarily the smartest ones, but kids they feel they can keep on a college track. They have a lot of kids -- maybe even a majority of sixth-graders -- who are not working at grade level when they come in.\"\nAcademics at Eastside combine rigor with an elaborate support structure.\n\"There are no shortcuts,\" Spanish teacher Shaneka Julian said.\nBut \"confidence-building -- defining students as intellectuals and scholars -- is a huge part of the culture,\" said Marianne Chowning-Dray, who taught calculus at Gunn High School for nine years before joining the Eastside faculty in 2005.\n\"It's assumed that everyone will participate, everyone can do this, that all students can achieve at a high level. We don't take no for an answer,\" Chowning-Dray said.\nThat culture felt strange to Thornton when he first arrived as a student. \"Normally students fear seeking help or talking to the teacher because they don't want to seem stupid or dumb for asking questions or not knowing something, but at Eastside we expected ourselves to ask these questions, we expected to meet the teacher outside of the class.\n\"They give you their email address; they give you their number. They do like sleeping, so they prefer that you contact them earlier, but if you contact them even at 10 p.m. and they're still awake they'll definitely help you out.\"\nEastside relies on volunteers to staff an intensive middle-school reading program, in which students begin their day with an hour and a half of intensive reading and writing.\nVolunteers like John Jacobs make it possible to break the students into small groups of four. \"Each morning we read a chapter out loud,\" Jacobs explained. \"We monitor the reading, we do vocabulary and comprehensive exercises and the kids do a writing response every day.\"\nVice-Principal Kim oversees \"Friday Night Homework,\" a routine that helps ensure no assignment is left undone. Students with incomplete work in any give week are required to stay on campus Friday evening until it is finished.\nSince Eastside's early days, Kim has tracked which students are missing which assignments. Now it can be done by computer.\n\"Friday afternoons we run a report of all missing assignments of all students,\" she explained. \"I do a lot of rounding up and calling parents to tell them not to pick up their student at 5 because they have to stay and complete assignments.\"\nShe considers the Friday night routine a \"safety net\" for kids who otherwise may consider the incomplete assignments \"out of sight, out of mind.\"\n\"Here, the work doesn't disappear, and if they've turned in all their assignments they're much less likely to do poorly in a class,\" she said.\nChowning-Dray, the math teacher, made the switch from Gunn to the Eastside faculty after becoming familiar with the school through helping, as a volunteer, to establish its calculus program.\n\"We built the program for AB calculus, and then they decided to expand to a BC sequence,\" she recalled, referring to the more advanced course. \"At that time I thought that would be a great match for me. It was an opportunity to reapply my skills and the knowledge I'd amassed over the years and put it toward this great mission.\"\n\"What might be assumed at another school we're very intentional about here,\" she said. \"If a student isn't doing their homework or outside assignments we notice that and try to figure out what's going on and get that student back on track.\n\"Students can fall through the cracks in a lot of schools, but I'd say Eastside is sealed really tight.\n\"I think a lot of efforts are being made in public high schools to create that sort of environment, but it's tough. What works here isn't necessarily scalable, but parts of it are. It's a lot about the people -- the longevity of the leaders, the vision of the people who work here.\"\nChowning-Dray has a total of about 100 students in her section of BC calculus and three sections of algebra II-trigonometry, as well as an afternoon study hall. At Gunn she might have had five classes with 30 students each.\nBut while they may have fewer students to keep track of, Eastside teachers and staff wear many hats.\nShaneka Julian, who teaches first-, second- and third-year Spanish to non-native speakers, also advises Eastside's Engineering Club, coaches the girls JV basketball team and fills in as a substitute dorm adviser. Bischof coaches boys basketball.\nOne of many lessons Bischof and Kim have learned is that, for first-generation students, college admission is only the start of the journey.\n\"At the beginning I was very naive and just thought if we could get them to college it would be a ticket to a better life and the rest would take care of itself,\" Bischof said. \"But we learned that first-generation college students face challenges that most of us who went to college can't even imagine.\n\"We saw some students able to be successful but others who did struggle, especially in that first year making the transition from the highly supportive environment here to a larger institution where they really were pioneers in their family and it was very easy to opt out if they didn't get off to a good start. That was eye-opening to us,\" Bischof said.\nThese days Eastside grads who are college freshmen, such as Thornton, get weekly or biweeky emails and calls from the school.\n\"They visit all the freshmen on their campuses,\" Thornton said. \"And they call you and ask 'How's everything going? What's new? Are your classes too demanding? Is everything fine at the dorm? Is anything surprising you?'\"\nFreshmen and sophomores are a particular focus, says Eastside's Alumni Program Director April Alvarez.\n\"Those first two years in college are crucial, and once they make it past that they're very likely to finish,\" she said.\nEastside staffers such as Kate Hiester also work year-round to help grads find summer internships and job leads -- much like a well-connected parent would.\nAnother post-graduate \"stabilizing force\" for Eastside alums is the fact that most enter college with some academic credit already under their belts.\nLongtime English teacher Amy Reilly recently went through the hiring process at Foothill College and now offers Eastside seniors a year of college-credit English.\nThe class, recognized by most UC campuses and all California State University campuses, is taught at Eastside but runs on Foothill's calendar. It adheres to Foothill guidelines, which include a 750-word minimum on assessed papers and a requirement that students generate at least 6,000 words per term. The first semester draws on nonfiction to cover different modes of writing -- observational, autobiographical, position papers, speculation about cause and effect and evaluation. The second semester is fiction-based, with students reading and analyzing \"Crime and Punishment,\" \"In Cold Blood,\" \"Oedipus Rex\" and \"Antigone.\"\n\"Our students are very well prepared in the humanities and this gives them even more confidence, and also room -- if they make a mistake at the beginning -- not have their financial aid frozen after a quarter or two,\" Reilly said.\nAll Eastside seniors also are required to produce a 25-page research paper using peer-reviewed literature and make a 30-minute presentation on the topic.\nAfter three decades of public school teaching -- mostly middle-school math in a tough, East Bay district -- longtime Eastside volunteer Jacobs is in a position to make comparisons.\n\"I was in a school full of tough kids. We had a good staff, good administration, but we were always plugging up holes in the dike. We couldn't do it fast enough -- you always felt you were a couple of steps behind.\n\"You have a lot of kids in the school ready to jump at a quality education, but it's very hard to provide it at the level we want to. Ten percent of the kids take up a lot of everybody's time, and you never have enough people.\"\nThe small scale of Eastside mitigates many of those factors, Jacobs said.\nCofounders Bischof and Kim are widely revered on campus.\nAt Eastside, Jacobs said, \"Kids can't walk across campus without several people saying hello and meaning it. Chris and Helen will stop and talk to them about whatever, make a connection.\n\"And they don't sit still. They're always pushing the envelope, trying to level the playing field.\"\nParent Mimi Pearson said, \"Any time Chris or Helen ask me to do anything I'm dropping everything to do it. They gave my daughters a chance, and they didn't have to. I'm never taking that for granted.\"\nAt this point the cofounders have no plans to expand or try to replicate their school but, having graduated 14 classes, are starting to see some of the long-term impact of their enterprise come into focus.\n\"We can see (graduates) advancing in their careers in the short time they've been out of college,\" Bischof said. \"They serve as role models and stay closely connected to the school.\"\nSome have remained in their college communities or moved away for professional opportunities but, he said, a majority return to the area, with many working in education. Some are teaching in East Palo Alto's Ravenswood City School District, and one even moved into the dorm along with his wife to take on the job of resident fellows.\n\"The feedback from our alumni really informs what we do at the high school level,\" he said. \"We'd be the first to say that this is a work in progress, and we continue to learn.\"\nI volunteer SS a tutor at the Project read Adult Literacy Program. One of my students, who only had 6 years of schooling in her native country, has enrolled her three children at Eastside Prep.

This past May, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Master of City Planning, focusing on economic development. I have dreams that someday my education will prepare me for a high position in energy leadership. These dreams would not be possible without the impact that Eastside had on my confidence and self-awareness. Having grown up in East Palo Alto, nobody ever believed in me as much as my teachers from Eastside did. Someday, I hope to repay them for the wonders they have brought to my small, poor community. Helen and Chris are truly a blessing for East Palo Alto.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T10:26:41Z","url":"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2013/12/06/eastside-prep-aims-to-close-opportunity-gap-with-personal-touch"}
{"text":"Final update (1:40 a.m.): Following a first-half scoring barrage, neither team could get on the board in the first ten minutes of the third quarter. Aside from a missed field goal by kicker Trent Domingue, Texas and California traded punts with both teams failing to find the endzone.\nNeither squad scored throughout the quarter, entering the fourth quarter at 35-33. While Texas continued to find success on the ground, it struggled through the air. With 15 minutes to play, Buechele was just 13-26 for 142 yards. He had one touchdown and one interception.\nTexas struck first in the game’s final quarter, scoring on its first possession. Foreman sprinted 47 yards into the endzone for his second score of the night, giving Texas a 40-35 lead with just over 13 minutes to play.\nBut California rebounded on its next drive. Webb led the Bears down the field, connecting with sophomore Chad Hansen. The Idaho State transfer hauled in a 28-yard pass on the sideline, preceding an 18-yard touchdown toss from Webb to Veasey. California converted the two-point conversion, giving it a 43-40 lead with just under 11 minutes to play.\nThe Longhorns answered on their next possession, driving into Bears territory. Texas was stopped short of the endzone, but Domingue connected from 35-yards out to tie the contest at 43-43 with 5:29 to play.\nThe Bears kept up the pace after Domingue’s field goal. Webb led California down the field once again, connecting with Chad Hansen for the wide receiver's second score of the night. Hansen tallied 12 catches for 196 yards following the score, placing Texas in a seven-point hole with 3:41 to play.\nThe Longhorns failed to stop California as it attempted to run out the clock. The Bears took three knees to end the game, winning 50-43 in Berkley.\nTexas fell to 2–1 on the year with the loss. The burnt orange will have a bye week next Saturday prior to facing Oklahoma State on Oct. 1 in Stillwater, Oklahoma.\nHalftime update (11:58 p.m.): Texas dug itself a hole from the first possession, as California drove the ball through the Texas defense en route to a 7-0 lead. Senior quarterback Davis Webb found wide receiver Jordan Veasey from 29 yards out, putting the Bears on top.\nThe Longhorns wouldn’t trail for long. Texas found the endzone on its first drive of the game, as sophomore Chris Warren scored from four yards out. Warren had five carries for 25 yards on the burnt orange’s opening possession.\nThe burnt orange defense stepped up in the game’s next possession, stopping the Bears on fourth down. Texas gained the lead upon receiving the ball, as kicker Trent Domingue connected from 38-yards out. With just over seven minutes to go in the first quarter, the Longhorns led 10-7.\nBut it wasn’t all good news for the Longhorns. Freshman quarterback Shane Buechele headed to the locker room after receiving a hit on third down. He had his chest examined by the Longhorn medical staff as senior quarterback Tyrone Swoopes entered the game.\nWith Buechele on the mend, Warren shouldered the load for the Longhorn offense. He ran it in from 12-yards out, extending Texas lead to 17-7. Warren compiled nine carries for 49 yards and two touchdowns by the end of the first quarter.\nCalifornia answered on its next possession. The Bears marched down the field on the Longhorns’ defense, highlighted by a 16-yard pass from Webb to freshman wide receiver Demetris Robertson. The Bears then punched it in from two-yards out, cutting Texas’ lead to 17-14.\nTexas’ rushing attack continued to gash the Bears on its next drive. This time, the offense wasn’t led by Warren, but junior running back D’Onta Foreman. He compiled 37 yards on three carries, including a four-yard touchdown carry. Texas led 24-14 with over 13 minutes left in the second quarter.\nAfter forcing a three-and-out, the Longhorns made their first mistake of the evening. Swoopes overthrew freshman Collin Johnson over the middle, resulting in an interception. California promptly moved down the field, scoring on a touchdown run from Vic Enwere. With just under ten minutes to go in the first half, Texas led 24-21.\nBuechele took the reigns at quarterback following the Bears touchdown, and quickly answered. The freshman led the Longhorns down the field for another score, connecting with senior Jacorey Warrick from 41-yards out.\nThe shootout continued as California regained possession. The Longhorn secondary was torched once again, this time surrendering a 29-yard touchdown from Webb to freshman Melquise Stovall. The touchdown cut Texas’ lead to three at 31-28.\nThere was more scoring to be had near the end of the half. Freshman safety Brandon Jones bursted through the California offensive line to block a punt, resulting in a safety.\nBut Buechele made his first mistake of the evening upon regaining possession, tossing an interception. The Bears’ capitalized on the freshman's mistake, scoring two plays later. Webb hit junior wide receiver Chad Hansen for a 23-yard touchdown, giving California a 35-33 lead.\nOriginal story: No. 11 Texas heads on the road for the first time this season at California. The Longhorns look to improve to 3–0 on the season for the first time since 2012.\nThe burnt orange face a potent Bears passing attack, led by senior quarterback Davis Webb. A transfer from Texas Tech, Webb is second in the nation with 963 passing yards through two games.\nStay tuned for live updates on this page and on Twitter: @TexanSports.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T03:59:00Z","url":"http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2016/09/17/live-blog-no-11-texas-hits-the-road-for-first-time-this-season-against-california"}

{"text":"It might have been different. Fresh off the settlement of the Union Station lawsuit — his initial cause célèbre — Chastain’s focus on light rail might have prompted an important community discussion about the funding and design of mass transit in Kansas City.\nSure, his drawings were wacky and unrealistic, and his funding mechanisms absurdly confused and inadequate. But Kansas City had a chance to use his enthusiasm and focus to engage the community in a workable light-rail approach.\nInstead — partly because of his style, partly because of hard-headed and misguided politicians — the discussion became about Chastain, not light rail. Indeed, the merits of light rail turned into a secondary concern, so much so that voters today probably have stronger opinions about him than they do about building commuter transit in the area.\nKansas City’s leaders want votes this year on an expanded streetcar system. Those votes will be difficult. Sales taxes are already high, and the benefits of a streetcar aren’t clear.\nBut the proposal may also be in trouble because Chastain has soured voters on any plan for rail transit — even though he actively opposes the streetcar in favor of his own plan.\nEven if the court orders that plan on the 2014 ballot, Chastain’s general unpopularity may doom it.\nThere’s a price for this tangled debacle. For example, all three cities competing with Kansas City for the 2016 Republican National Convention have light rail.\nYou may be OK with that, or not. But Chastain’s crusade has clearly left light rail adrift with little hope of reaching the shore in his lifetime — or ours.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T03:07:42Z","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/local-columnists/article508222/Dave-Helling-Clay-Chastain%E2%80%99s-light-rail-obsession-has-hurt-his-cause.html"}
{"text":"Members of Bassa, the British Airways cabin crew section of the Unite union, have voted to be balloted over a new offer from BA management.\nThe new deal, if agreed, will see staff win serious concessions—but there are also important omissions.\nOver 500 union members gathered for a mass meeting about the deal in West London today (Thursday).\nThe deal offers full reinstatement of staff travel that bosses took from strikers, based on original terms of seniority.\nPrevious BA chief executive Willie Walsh had said this would happen 'over my dead body'. And workers cheered Walsh's departure as BA boss.\nThere will also be a pay increase totalling 7.5 percent over two years—4 percent this year, backdated, and 3.5 percent next year. It is unclear whether there are productivity requirements attached.\nManagement has also agreed that there will be no unilateral imposition of any new terms and conditions without full negotiations with the union.\nBut a thread of uncertainty ran through the contributions from cabin crew during and after the meeting.\nDozens of cabin crew have been sacked during the dispute.\nUnite general secretary Len McCluskey told the meeting the sackings were 'nonsensical'. But the agreement does not include the full reinstatement of the sacked staff.\nAll it agrees to is binding arbitration. And those who have already been through an employment tribunal and are waiting for results, will be, in McCluskey's words, 'dealt with separately'.\nThe original cause of the dispute—BA's cutting of jobs and introducing a new mixed fleet with new workers on worse pay and conditions—remains untouched.\nMany workers were unhappy with the praise McCluskey and Bassa reps heaped on new BA chief executive Keith Williams.\nMcCluskey described the new executive as a 'genuine and honest man', saying to cabin crew, 'he values you'.\nHe said the agreement was 'honourable', although he admitted that the union hadn’t won all of its demands.\nHe also described a 'change within management psyche'. It is no surprise that this psychobabble left crew feeling unsettled.\nMcCluskey left early before crew were given the chance to ask questions. And he asked the meeting to vote on putting the agreement out to ballot before the questions.\nThis angered some workers. One stood up and said she voted against the deal going to ballot because there should have been questions before the vote. 'We need to have our democratic say,' she argued.\nAnother expressed concern over the way in which the union was trying to 'push a deal' on crew rather than allow an open discussion about pros and cons.\nMany asked how Bassa would survive when the mixed fleet remained and new starters were all employed on worse conditions.\nAfter nearly two years of a media witch-hunt and abuse from BA, it is no surprise that many cabin crew feel relieved to have a deal.\nBut no deal should be agreed without the reinstatement of every sacked worker, and without the issue of new starters being resolved.\nSolidarity, something cabin crew have fought hard for, cannot be dropped now. Allowing BA to employ workers on worse terms will weaken the position of the union.\nAlthough the agreement includes concessions from management, cabin crew are right not to trust them.\nBassa members have shown their willingness to fight in five ballots. The latest vote, in March, was more than 83 percent for strikes.\nManagement are making concessions because they are desperate for things to quieten down. The strikes have hit BA hard.\nBut Unite has said it will not call more strike dates. Instead the union’s 10,000 members at BA will now be balloted on the deal.\nMcCluskey said the union would be making a 'strong recommendation' that members accept it, and that he was 'very confident' they would.\nBut without full reinstatement and an agreement not to undermine pay and conditions of all workers, it should be rejected.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T11:01:57Z","url":"https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/24371/BA+workers+vote+to+ballot+on+new+deal"}

{"text":"\"Cabin Fever\" is a virtual conversation between two friends who come from the opposite ends of the political spectrum but share a belief in the power of public education to improve lives and brighten our collective future. The focus of the conversation is the federal K-12 education law known as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (No Child Left Behind), which is in progress in Congress. Our initial post on February 4 reflected areas of agreement around annual testing and transparency. Additional posts focus on areas of disagreement and will run simultaneously through February 19 every other day on Rick's blog at Education Week and on Education Post.\nShould Congress require that state goals for adequate school performance be approved by the U.S. Department of Education?\nPeter Cunningham is the Executive Director of Education Post, a Chicago-based nonprofit supporting efforts to improve public education. He previously served as Assistant Secretary for Education in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2012.\nGiven our history of unintended consequences stemming from education policy decisions, let's ask how the incentives would play out if the federal government stopped approving performance goals for states. Would states do the right thing and set responsible, achievable, and ambitious targets? History suggests otherwise.\nA state that wants to look good and protect the status quo might set easily achievable targets to weaken the case for change. A state that wants to make the case for choice might set impossible targets so schools consistently fall short.\nAmerica cannot leave educational outcomes to chance, politics, or ideology. High expectations for all kids—low-income, minorities, students with disabilities, English language learners, and every other child at risk—should not be optional for states or subject to the whims of the political leadership in power at the time.\nOur job is to protect every child and give him or her the best education possible. That's a national imperative that warrants a meaningful federal role to ensure that all children are making progress every year.\nThe challenge, however, is for performance targets to reflect the aspirations and realities on the ground—to be more \"bottom-up\" than \"top down.\" To that end, and recognizing that NCLB's one-size-fits-all goals were unrealistic and led to a variety of unintended consequences, we should build on the work of the current administration and negotiate performance targets at the state level.\nAny state or district that believes lower or higher performance targets are in the best interests of kids should be required to make the case to parents, educators, taxpayers, and the federal government. That way, everyone will own it.\nIt's a good thing for every state to be clear and public about how it gauges adequate school performance. However, while Congress should require this transparency, Congress should not require that the U.S. Department of Education play any role in approving these state decisions. As I see it, there are four key problems with that kind of prescriptive federal role.\nFirst, performance targets can be powerful motivators when they are concrete, when they are shared, and when the goal-setters are accountable for the results. The problem with federal involvement is that federal officials have no responsibility for meeting the goals they insist upon and no accountability if schools fail to do so. All the blame falls on local educators and on local and state officials. The result is that it's all too easy for D.C. officials to insist upon ridiculous goals. In fact, the inclination to aim high (as with NCLB's 100% proficiency targets) yields aspirational goals that are more a symbolic statement than a serious tool for improving schools or systems.\nSecond, when federal officials promulgate grand goals, real people are then required to treat these as a practical gauge of success. The Soviet Union showed where this tends to lead, as decades of ludicrous five-year plans that promised heroic increases in agricultural production produced little grain, but lots of cynicism, deception, and lies.\nThird, a federal sign-off inevitably means federal guidelines or requirements. Given the need to fit fifty states with 100,000 schools, any meaningful parameters will be too rigid to be a good fit for many systems and schools (as with NCLB's requirement that any school was failing to make AYP if any single subgroup failed to hit a proficiency bar).\nFinally, giving the feds a role in approving state targets presumes a false certainty and science when it comes to determining adequate performance. There's simply no rational basis for federal officials to insist there is a best-practice system or set of expectations. These are open questions, and we're best served by states exploring a diverse array of systems.\nLet me put it this way. The NFL season just ended. Over the next couple months, coaches should sit with their executives and owners in order to set goals regarding the kind of performance they expect to see. That process is valuable and I heartily endorse it. At the same time, I don't think it would be constructive for the Pennsylvania legislature to declare that the Eagles and Steelers need to go at least 11-5 next year.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T04:38:04Z","url":"https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rick_hess_straight_up/2015/02/esea_cabin_fever_state_goals_for_performance.html"}

The radiator had been overheating, and despite weeks of tweaking, nothing worked.\nBut Greenberg, and a random assortment of other retired men who meet every Thursday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the shop, refused to give up. The group, who work in a cavernous metal garage filled with electric saws and paint cans, restore antique vehicles for historical groups and law enforcement agencies, from an 1887 Studebaker Wagon and a 1905 Fire Chief’s Cadillac for the San Jose Fire Museum to a horse cart for the Saratoga Historic Museum.

Greenberg worked at IBM for 30 years as an engineer.\nBut each man’s hobbies or their unique talents bring something crucial to their weekly meetings. Be it woodwork, carpentry or painting, somehow everybody’s abilities weld together to help restore beautiful pieces that would otherwise have been left to rot in scrap yards.\nEach project that the group works on can take months, sometimes years to complete, and none of the men are paid. The projects they work on aren’t funded either, and most of the time, the group will find discarded pieces of wood or metal or brings tools, nails and screws from home to help complete a piece that would have otherwise languished until some amount of money was donated.\n“Beg, borrow, steal. That’s how we get things done,” Dorr joked.\nWhile the group waits their next project to arrive — a 1932 Twin Coach Model 15 bus, which is set to get to San Jose sometime in April — the men will continue to tinker on the pesky radiator on the Model TT and dabble in other projects that may come along.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T14:40:41Z","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/01/22/san-jose-restoration-volunteers-bring-antiques-back-to-life-for-silicon-valley/"}

The 30-second spot (posted below) and the website 33thanks.com directs people to the Assist the Officer Foundation, which aids cops and former cops in need, and the families of officers killed in the line of duty.\n\"I'm a real stickler about little things make big things happen,\" Dorsett said Tuesday. \"And just for a little thing like that to say, 'hey, thank you' -- that goes a long way.\"\nDallas Police Association President Ron Pinkston said he was \"incredibly grateful\" to have Dorsett's help.\nDorsett spoke Tuesday to The Dallas Morning News about the campaign.\nDMN: What made you want to get involved in this campaign?\nDorsett: I thought it was a great idea just to say thank you. I also want to help people feel a little more comfortable when they see a police car or police officer, and to understand that these guys -- they have families as well. They're out here protecting our families, putting their lives on the line. So, just to create more awareness about what they do and for people to appreciate what they do.\nDMN: Have you had a long relationship with law enforcement?\nDorsett: (Laughing) Man, I've been in and out of jail a few times. I've had a long rap sheet. No, but when I was approached about the whole scenario, I said, 'man, this is great.' People talk about heroes and I said, man, these are our real heroes ... There is a certain comfort level in knowing that when I leave town and something goes wrong and my wife calls 911, they're going to show up and help protect my family.\nDMN: Have you done anything like this before?\nDorsett: I can't say I have. But this is long overdue ... I'm just hoping this takes off all over the country. We've lost a lot of good men over the years -- fathers, husbands who have been policemen.\nDMN: Is there any reason why you're doing this now, specifically with all the negativity nationally toward policing and their tactics?\nDorsett: I don't know why it's now. All I know is that it is now. Obviously, this could come back with the negative things that are going on with police departments. But I've always felt that -- even myself, personally, I'm an old guy -- if a police car pulls up beside them I think, 'what have I done?' But for young people at an early age, it's about telling them, police officers are your friends. They're not your enemies. And the young kids today, if they can learn that and appreciate that ... it takes the stigma off police officers.\nDMN: Do you think there is a lot of distrust, maybe more than normal, in police right now?\nDorsett: I haven't been paying attention to who is trustworthy as far as police are concerned. But we as a society need to understand what the big picture is with police officers. Every time you see a policeman, you think 'it's bad, it's bad, it's bad.' We need to get away from that thought process. They're not bad people. These are good people. They're here to run the bad folks away. There is good and bad in just about everything.

{"text":"In the wake of mass digitisation, market consolidation and the launch of ambitious new trading platforms, experts in the out-of-home sector are calling for a boost to standards to ensure a smooth evolution away from static posters.\nSpeaking at the 2018 Automated Trading Debate, hosted by Mediatel, a gathering of traders and industry bosses were told without agreed standards out-of-home would be bogged down by needless complexity at a time when it was seeking to grow its share of market through investment in digital screens.\n\"Out-of-home has always been a complex medium to navigate, even when it was just billboards and posters,\" said Gavin Lee, the chief technology officer of Posterscope and the co-chair of the OOH Standards Committee - the body which is helping in the transition to a more automated future.\n\"With the rise of digital and an abundance of location data, the complexity is even greater. It is now critical to manage this.\"\nLee said settling on agreed standards for audience measurement, the meaning of an 'impact' or 'impression', and the terminology used for transacting is now vital if the sector is to reap the benefits of its recent investments, which globally now includes more than 300,000 digital screens, led by more advanced UK and US markets.\n\"The whole point of technology is to unblock barriers advertisers may have to buy in a different medium...for this to move forward, standardisation is critical.\"\nThe industry already has different automated or programmatic trading systems in place to deal with the influx of data and digital tech - including Posterscope's ECOS platform, and VIOOH, a new company set up by market leader JCDecaux, amongst others.\nArguing that it is good for the market to have use of an assortment of competing platforms, Lee said this will nevertheless be hindered without agreement across the sector on standards.\n\"We've made huge investments in physical infrastructure, but now we need to manage that technology,\" he said. \"Agreed definitions will allow competition to flourish and different systems to connect and talk the same language.\"\nAccording to Warc, spend on digital out of home advertising is expected to grow 10.1% each year between 2018 and 2021, accounting for the entirety of growth in the OOH market as spend on traditional sites begins to decline from next year.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T13:06:40Z","url":"https://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2018/12/04/we-have-the-tech-now-its-time-for-standards-says-ooh-boss/"}

{"text":"But it's worth stepping back from Romney's specific remarks and looking at President Obama's clean-energy track record more broadly. What sorts of green jobs programs has the Obama administration spent $90 billion on? Where does it all go? How much of the funds have been wasted? And what are we actually getting in return for all this cash?\n1) The stimulus provided some $90 billion in financing for a wide array of clean energy programs. Here’s the breakdown: There's $29 billion for improving energy efficiency, including home retrofits; $21 billion in incentives for renewable generation, such as solar and wind; $10 billion for modernizing the electric grid; $6 billion to promote advanced vehicles and a domestic battery industry; $18 billion for high-speed rail and other trains; $3 billion for research into carbon capture for coal plants; $3 billion for job training; and $3 billion for clean manufacturing tax credits.\nA few caveats. Not all of these programs are strictly Obama programs. Some of them were signed into law by President Bush, but didn't get funding until the stimulus was enacted. An example is ARPA-E, which conducts research into long-shot energy technologies and was first created in 2007. What's more, some programs involve loans or loan guarantees, which means the money will be repaid so long as the companies survive.\n2) The vast majority of these projects are still up and running, though there have been a few notable failures. It is not even close to true that \"half\" of the energy companies funded by the stimulus have \"gone out of business,\" as Romney said. Many of the programs, such as the tax credits and grants for wind and solar production, only pay out when the turbines and solar panels churn out electricity.\nRomney's campaign later clarified that he was solely referring to the Energy Department's 1705 loan program, which provides about $16.1 billion to clean-energy companies. Yet of the 33 companies that have received loan guarantees, just three are in bankruptcy—including Solyndra, which could cost the government up to $535 million. (The other two firms are Abound Solar and Beacon Power, which is still operating and has largely repaid its federal loan.) Additional companies could eventually fail, but for now, the default rate is just 2.6 percent for one program in the stimulus.\nIt's worth noting that Congress created the 1705 loan program with the expectation that some companies would fail. The government was supposed to take risks. And, as energy analyst Gregory Kats has testified (pdf), the loan program's final cost will likely end up well below the $2.47 billion Congress set aside to cover losses.\n3) The stimulus appears to have boosted U.S. wind and solar generation. Here's Mike Grunwald with a top-line summary: \"Before President Obama took office, the U.S. had 25 gigawatts of wind power, and the government’s 'base case' energy forecast expected 40 GW by 2030. Well, it’s not quite 2030 yet, but we’ve already got 50 GW of wind. We’ve also got about 5 GW of solar, which isn’t much but is over six times as much as we had before Obama.\"\nCosts are dropping, too. The price of photovoltaic systems has fallen in half, from $7.20 per watt in 2007 to $3.47 per watt in 2011, although solar is still more expensive than conventional electricity. And the cost of new wind turbines fell 27 percent from 2008 to 2011. It's difficult, however, to sort out how much of the decline was due to the stimulus and how much due to China's massive foray into wind and solar manufacturing.\nLet's also put these advances in perspective: Solar and wind still generate a small fraction of U.S. electricity—just 3 percent in 2011. And it's not clear that either industry can maintain its rapid growth without further subsidies. For instance, a key tax credit for wind generation is set to sunset at the end of this year, which would slow down turbine construction dramatically, especially since wind has to compete against cheap natural gas.\n4) Other green programs in the stimulus have a murkier track record, though it could take years to see results. The Obama administration spent $2.4 billion to create a new battery industry in the United States, yet many of those factories are now running idle, thanks to weak demand for electric cars. A modern \"smart grid\" could one day enable the country to juggle intermittent power from solar and wind, but the technologies have been slow to gain a foothold. Likewise, the federal government is chipping in $3.2 billion for high-speed passenger rail between San Francisco and Los Angeles—but it's uncertain if the line will ever get finished.\nAdvocates of the energy programs argue that it will take time for some investments to pan out. Electric cars, for instance, could eventually catch on. And ARPA-E is bankrolling research into novel ideas like laser drilling for geothermal energy and advanced lithium-ion batteries. Will these inventions transform the energy industry? It may take years to find out.\nOther stimulus efforts are showing signs of progress after early missteps. Back in 2009, the $5 billion home weatherization program looked like an outright disaster; in Delaware, state officials were grappling with contractors doing \"shoddy, unnecessarily expensive work.\" Since then, however, the Energy Department has managed to weatherize one million homes, saving consumers an estimated average of $400 per year on energy bills.\n5) Clean energy has received the vast bulk of government since 2009, but it hasn't always been this way. Ever since the first tariffs to protect Pennsylvania coal in the late 1700s, the U.S. government has always nurtured new energy sources. And, over the decades, fossil fuels and nuclear power have received the bulk of that support, as a report last year from the venture-capital firm DBL investors showed.\nA raw subsidy count, however, can be misleading. Government support for energy can manifest itself in all sorts of ways. Take the drilling technique known as \"fracking,\" which has led to a recent surge in U.S. oil and gas production from shale rock. That was developed by private industry with vital aid from the federal government, which contributed research, key pilot projects, and mapping assistance. Fracking took 25 years to develop and fine-tune, a product of a number of programs and collaborations—a reminder that energy technology rarely develops in a straightforward, predictable fashion.\n— The stimulus isn't all that Obama has done on energy. He has also ratcheted up fuel-economy standards for automobiles to 54 miles per gallon by 2025 and enacted a number of EPA regulations on carbon and mercury that will likely hamper coal plants.\n— Here's a look at Romney's plan for North American oil independence by 2020. Also note that Romney supports ARPA-E, the $400 million program for long-shot energy research.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T10:26:21Z","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/10/04/a-closer-look-at-obamas-90-billion-for-clean-energy/"}
{"text":"Hello Marvel movie fans! Today we have new bits to offer about two upcoming superhero films. Fox's newest installment in X-Men movie franchise, The Wolverine, now has an official synopsis - and it (in no uncertain terms) hints a truly epic movie experience.\nWe also have word on the shortlist of actors that Sony is eyeing to star in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, as Peter Parker's friend (turned enemy) Harry Osborn, a role made famous by James Franco in the original Spider-Man movie trilogy.\nFox has been doing a good deal of PR as of late, trying hard to establish The Wolverine as a standalone film experience. Director James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma) and star Hugh Jackman recently did an online Q&A session, where it was firmly established that the film is NOT \"Wolverine 2\" by any means; it does take place after X-Men 3 and will be a sort of new starting point for the character; and the story will go deeper and the action will be more grounded (but fiercer) than any other depiction of the character, to date.\nA few gems in the synopsis would be the reference to Silver Samurai, the film's big mutant antagonist, and clues to the oft-mentioned thematic arc of the film, which finds Wolverine having to deal with his own immortality after having watched so many friends and loved ones (like those in X3) die. The only lingering question I personally have is whether or not that last part, about the \"new Wolverine\" we'll get by the end of the film, will have any bearing on the events of Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past. With Fox now building their own Marvel Movie Universe, it's certainly possible.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T00:51:08Z","url":"https://screenrant.com/wolverine-2013-synopsis-amazing-spider-man-2-harry-osborn/"}

{"text":"Pilar Goncalves, 22, with her husband, was told she had Zika virus, which health authorities suspect may be linked to a rare birth defect. After a blood test, she was \"desperately relieved\" to be given the all-clear.\nBrazil&apos;s Ministry of Health made an unprecedented announcement this month: It told women in the northeast of the country not to get pregnant for the foreseeable future.\nAnd it&apos;s all because of a mosquito — the Aedes aegypti species, which can spread a variety of diseases, including Zika virus. Health experts in Brazil are concerned that the virus, whose symptoms are typically a low-grade fever and bright red rash, might be having a devastating impact on newborns.\n\"Normally in a year you&apos;d have maybe three or four cases,\" he says by phone from his home city of Natal in Brazil&apos;s north. \"In 24 hours when we asked around, there had been 11 in the city. And that was a shocking enough number that we realized something very serious was happening.\"\nIt&apos;s not clear when Zika arrived in Brazil, though some doctors speculate it could have come with African visitors during the World Cup.\nInitially, it wasn&apos;t a concern. Normally, Zika is not a serious infection, unlike malaria and dengue, for example. People are ill for a few days and generally recover.\nBrazil&apos;s Ministry of Health says there is now a suspected link between Zika and the cases of microcephaly in infants.\n\"Everyone involved in this is extremely concerned about what could happen,\" says Luz. \"We don&apos;t yet understand this illness.\"\nThe Health Ministry is now working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an arm of the World Health Organization to figure out what is going on. In the meantime, six states in Brazil have announced a state of emergency. There are 1,761 cases of microcephaly; many more are expected as Brazil&apos;s Health Ministry says more than 1 million people could have contracted the virus.\n\"It&apos;s an enormous concern because of the children,\" she said.\nBut experts say the mosquito came back after those measures were relaxed. These days it&apos;s everywhere. Beyond Zika, Brazil is actually suffering a dengue epidemic right now as well, with over 1.5 million cases in the country.\nBut it&apos;s not clear why Zika virus could be having this effect on fetuses.\n\"It&apos;s a mystery for everyone.

{"text":"Mary Pezzulo over at Steel Magnificat has written an excellent piece about the problem with name-calling, contentiousness, and point-scoring in the name of “apologetics.” I agree completely with what she says, and I recommend reading her post.\nI also want to offer a few thoughts from the other side of the aisle, as it were. If you spend a lot of time in ideologically motivated communities, you’re going to encounter a lot of sanctimony and self-righteousness. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a member of 300 different Catholic FaceBook groups, or you are deeply involved in the vegan community, or you made the mistake of going to a mom’s group in an upscale neighbourhood; the basic practices are the same.\nA group of people gather together and someone makes an assertion that is basically intended to signal how virtuous, well-informed, intelligent, hip, woke, or generally awesome they are. Others jump in. Some just ante-up by agreeing with the original statement and affirming it’s sagacity. Others up the stakes by making a claim that builds on the original assertion, showing that they not only equal the first speaker but actually exceed them. And so it goes around the table until suddenly somebody calls.\nThis could take the form of a direct call-out – accusing one of the speakers of hypocrisy or bad behaviour, or showing that actually they’re exaggerating their accomplishments or commitments. It could involve pointing out a contradiction in one of the statements. It could be a flat denial of some dubious truth claim. Or it might be a pointed ‘Socratic’ question designed to expose the flaws in someone’s thinking without openly telling them that they’re an idiot.\nMore commonly, though, it turns out that a certain amount of bluffing was involved. And this is where things have the capacity to get ugly, because in social situations there aren’t the same kind of clear hierarchies as in poker: there’s not a rule-book that you can appeal to determine whether hearing Jesus speaking to you in your heart carries more, or less, weight than having discussed the question in a private audience with the Archbishop.\nSo it descends into bickering, and depending on how high the stakes are the arguments can go on for hours, or days, or months… or years… or decades. If institutional bodies get involved, a good squabble can last for centuries. The pretext is always the same: both sides insist that they are actually concerned with truth, or justice, the correction of error, or the protection of the weak. But to any onlooker with even a shred of objectivity, it’s clear that actually what’s at stake is the need to win back whatever social currency was put on the table. People’s pride, prestige, honour or reputations are at stake and so they feel that they can’t just walk away.\nThe more hurtful the situation becomes, the more invested people are. So they’ll stay, even if they are being bullied, name-called, shamed, or directly threatened – because all of these things cause the stakes to go further up, and up, and up. Backing down means walking away and leaving your winnings behind (you always think of the winnings as yours, even if it’s far from clear that they rightfully belong to you).\nOkay, so it’s very easy to point and laugh at people who are behaving this way – and I’m not even going to argue that it’s wrong to do so. Part of the social process by which we learn that ridiculous behaviours are ridiculous is by finding that we have become an object of ridicule. When you’ve been wounded in some com-box dust-up, and instead of rushing around to sympathize, people laugh and start singing “Let it Go!” it’s unpleasant for sure…but in retrospect, these are often the moments when we learn humility.\nBesides, if everybody behaved as if these absurd exchanges were actually legitimate contests being fought for important reasons, we would end up like the nobility of the 17th century: monumentally stupid slights would result in actual bloodshed, and there would be real debates over questions like whether a monk’s “right” to defend his honour justified his participation in duels.\nHowever, it’s important to lace our laughter with at least a touch of self-derision. Whether your response is to roll your eyes and scroll past, or grab a bag of popcorn and sit back to watch the fur fly, maybe also take a moment to say a little mea culpa. Because in one way or another, this is something we all do.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T03:40:13Z","url":"https://www.patheos.com/blogs/catholicauthenticity/2017/04/sanctimony-wars/"}

He says to him he does not think this will affect his image negatively but rather positively because nobody knows the change his situation will impact on him when he comes back.\n?Daasebre is the best artiste I have worked with so far and was like a senior brother to me he added?. He concluded this interview by telling all those who says he deals in drug to stop spreading false information to the public.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T14:07:16Z","url":"https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/Sugar-Tone-Young-But-Very-Dynamic-193068"}
{"text":"The first big primary night of 2018 is in the books.\nIt was tough going for some Republican House members looking for a promotion. But it also might cause a little heartburn for Republicans who are hoping to return to the chamber, or join it for the first time.\nBased on Tuesday's results, CNN is moving four races to a more competitive ranking -- all in favor of the Democrats. In three of those contests, Republicans remain strong favorites to hold the seat, but Democrats landed candidates they feel are good fits for the districts. That also is true in the fourth race on the list, which moves to the Toss-Up column. Of the 22 races now rated as Toss-Ups, 20 are currently held by Republicans.\nAs a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House.\nNC-09: GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger became the first incumbent to lose a renomination contest this cycle, creating an open seat opportunity for Democrats where the party had already landed a strong challenger. Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine Corps veteran and clean energy entrepreneur, received nearly 38,000 votes Tuesday -- roughly 4,000 more than Pittenger and GOP primary winner Mark Harris combined. McCready heads into the general election with $1.2 million in the bank compared to about $70,000 for Harris, a former pastor. This district went for Donald Trump by 12 points in 2016, but Democrats hold a clear edge in enthusiasm at this stage of the race. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.\nWV-03: State Sen. Richard Ojeda scored a convincing victory in the Democratic primary Tuesday night, receiving 52% of the vote against three challengers. Ojeda received nearly 30,000 votes in the primary, which came close to matching the total combined votes for the top four vote-getters in the GOP primary. State Del. Carol Miller won that seven-person contest with 24% of the vote. Democrats will face an uphill climb is this southern West Virginia seat. Donald Trump carried the 3rd District by 50 points in 2016 while Mitt Romney carried it by 32 points. But Ojeda's populist platform combined with his background as a decorated Army veteran who voted for Trump could appeal in a district that was represented by former Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall until he lost his 2014 re-election bid. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.\nIN-02: Three-term GOP Rep. Jackie Walorski will face off against Democrat Mel Hall in November. Hall, a former minister, received 42% of the vote in Tuesday's crowded six-candidate Democratic primary. Walorski won her last two races with comfortable margins after earning a narrow victory in 2012 to the seat vacated by current Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly. Donald Trump won this district, home to South Bend and Elkhart, by 22 points. That was a dramatic swing from 2008, when Barack Obama and John McCain were separated by about 700 votes. Walorski enters the general election as a clear favorite, with a little more than $1 million in the bank as of mid-April. Hall starts off with $236,000 cash on hand, but he's shown an ability to stay competitive in fundraising the last two quarters. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.\nIN-09: This is another Hoosier State race with a heavily-favored GOP incumbent and a Democratic nominee who could pose a challenge. Democrat Liz Watson, a former congressional staffer, eclipsed two other candidates with 66% of the vote in Tuesday's primary. She'll face off against first-term Rep. Trey Hollingsworth in November. Watson has outraised Hollingsworth the past two fundraising quarters, although the Republican holds a cash-on-hand advantage of $432,000 to $297,000. Hollingsworth, whose net worth is in excess of $50 million, has the ability to help his own cause if necessary. In 2016, he spent $3.1 million of his own money on his campaign. The district includes some Indianapolis and Louisville suburbs, as well as Bloomington, home to Indiana University. Hillary Clinton won Monroe County, where the school is based, by 23 points in 2016. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T08:57:16Z","url":"https://www.kimt.com/content/national/482207101.html"}

{"text":"John F Kennedy International Airport, one of the busiest in the United States, will be getting a US$10 billion upgrade, New York's state governor said Wednesday.\n[NEW YORK] John F Kennedy International Airport, one of the busiest in the United States, will be getting a US$10 billion upgrade, New York's state governor said Wednesday.\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo said the plan calls for creating \"a unified, interconnected airport that changes the passenger experience and makes the airport much easier to access and navigate\".\nIn a city that considers itself the centre of the universe, JFK airport is considered a modest 59th in the world in terms of passenger experience behind London Heathrow and Seoul, among many others.\nIt is famed for overcrowding, flights being late; critics also bemoan the fact that getting to JFK from Manhattan is not fast, smooth or easy.\n\"John F Kennedy airport was once a world-class transportation hub, envied by the entire nation. Today, it is choked with traffic and burdened with outdated systems and decaying infrastructure,\" said Pat Foye, Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\nWith better amenities and security, the goal is for JFK not to lose out to the competition as a source of money, jobs and pride. JFK welcomed 60 million passengers in 2016, and hopes to hit 75 million in 2030, and 100 million by 2050.\n\"For each million passengers that JFK fails to accommodate, the region loses approximately US$140 million in wages, US$400 million in sales, and 2,500 jobs. JFK is one of the only major airports in the world that does not offer travelers a one seat ride from its city center,\" Mr Foye stressed.\nOf the almost US$10 billion budget, 8 billion is for terminals and 1.5 to 2 billion for road and highway improvements.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T18:35:58Z","url":"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/transport/jfk-airport-to-get-us10b-world-class-upgrade"}

{"text":"Danny Rand and Luke Cage won't be the only heroes having a crossover moment in Luke Cage Season 2, and the new clip below reveals that Colleen Wing and Misty Knight will get a chance to team up as well. The video shows Misty and Colleen doing some day drinking and getting rudely interrupted by a guy who has some beef with Misty. And don't go thinking this is all about verbal jabs, because things quickly devolve into a classic bar room brawl led by two of Marvel TV's most badass women.\nMisty and Colleen managed to drop their assailants despite Misty not even having her bionic arm just yet. Colleen gave her friend a bit of tough love by at first refusing aid, which nearly inspired Misty enough to handle all those attackers on her own! Of course, the Iron Fist regular soon stepped in as the criminals began to swarm, and she whipped out some of the patented kung fu skills that made her one of the shining stars opposite Finn Jones' Danny Rand. Both women bested the foes pretty easily in the Luke Cage clip, although it's not like anyone should be surprised by that, considering who we're talking about.\nThis particular Luke Cage moment seems to be more about Colleen helping Misty cope with the loss of her arm, rather than something advancing the main overarching plot. One thing this clip does reveal, however, is that Misty apparently doesn't have her bionic arm at the start of Luke Cage Season 2. This may mean that Rand's company will be involved in granting her the tech for her new arm, as some had theorized after The Defenders. It may also mean the Iron Fist and Luke Cage crossover happens very early on in Season 2, although it's certainly possible that Season 2 will hold off on Misty getting a new arm until much later.\nThe Misty and Colleen clip is hopefully a small taste of what's in store for the Iron Fist crossover in Season 2, and it better not be the only time Luke Cage pays homage to Daughters of the Dragon. Following The Defenders, rumors swirled that the groundwork was being laid for Simone Missick and Jessica Henwick to team up for comic-inspired heroics, and it looks as though Luke Cage found time to set that up amidst putting Luke and Danny's Heroes For Hire-inspired scenes together.\nLuke Cage showrunner Cheo Coker has said he hopes Marvel fans warm up more to Iron Fist after watching Season 2 of Luke Cage. Provided Danny and Luke gel as well as Colleen and Misty did in this scene, and as they did in Defenders, there's a strong possibility that fans will embrace Iron Fist Season 2 with more open arms. But if not, perhaps Marvel can shift focus to bringing Wing and Knight's Daughters of the Dragon arcs to viewers sooner rather than later.\nLuke Cage Season 2 premieres on Netflix on Friday, June 22 at 12:01 a.m. PT.

{"text":"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the leading provider of cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications, today released its Third Quarter, 2013 State of the Internet Report. Based on data gathered from the Akamai Intelligent Platform™, the report provides insight into key global statistics such as network connectivity and connection speeds, attack traffic, and broadband adoption and availability, among many others.\nThe Third Quarter, 2013 State of the Internet Report includes insights into the likelihood of repeat DDoS attacks against an individual target, the continued attack activity by a group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army, as well as observations on Akamai traffic activity related to Internet disruptions in Syria, Myanmar and Sudan. The report also reviews mobile browser usage by network type based on data from Akamai IO.\nThe global average connection speed continued its upward trend in the third quarter of 2013, climbing 10% over the previous quarter to 3.6 Mbps. A total of 122 countries/regions that qualified for inclusion saw average connection speeds increase during the third quarter, with growth ranging from 0.5 percent in Namibia (to 1.1 Mbps) to a 76 percent increase in Nepal (to 3.6 Mbps).\nAverage connection speeds saw a 29 percent year-over-year increase, with all of the top 10 countries/regions climbing 27 percent or more. Globally, 133 qualifying countries/regions saw year-over-year increases in average connection speeds, from 0.2 percent in Egypt (to 1.2 Mbps) to 259 percent in Réunion (to 6.8 Mbps).\nGlobal average peak connection speeds showed a slight decline in the third quarter of 2013, dropping 5.2 percent to 17.9 Mbps. Seven of the top 10 countries/regions saw increases in average peak connection speeds during the quarter, ranging from 0.5 percent in Hong Kong (to 65.4 Mbps) to 19 percent in South Korea (to 63.6 Mbps). Meanwhile, Romania, Latvia and Belgium saw declines of 4.4, 3.3 and 3.6 percent to 45.4, 43.1 and 38.5 Mbps, respectively.\nYear over year, the global average peak connection speed grew 13 percent over the third quarter of 2012. Yearly increases among the top 10 countries/regions ranged from 15 percent in Latvia to 63 percent in Singapore. Worldwide, 115 qualifying countries/regions showed yearly growth in average connection speeds, with increases ranging from 0.3 percent in South Africa (to 11.9 Mbps) to 111 percent in Palestine (to 19.9 Mbps).\nGlobal high broadband (>10 Mbps) adoption rose 31 percent quarter-over-quarter to reach 19 percent. Global broadband (>4 Mbps) adoption improved 5.8 percent over the quarter to reach 53 percent.\n\"In the third quarter of 2013, we observed that long-term growth in average and average peak connection speeds remained strong, as did growth in global broadband and high broadband adoption rates. We believe these trends point to continued improvement in the quality and performance of Internet connectivity in countries around the world,\" said David Belson, the report's editor.\nAkamai maintains a distributed set of unadvertised agents deployed across the Internet that log connection attempts, which the company classifies as attack traffic. Based on the data collected by these agents, Akamai is able to identify the top countries from which attack traffic originates, as well as the top ports targeted by these attacks. It is important to note, however, that the originating country as identified by the source IP address may not represent the nation in which an attacker resides. For example, an individual in the United States may be launching attacks from compromised systems anywhere in the world.\nAkamai observed attack traffic originating from 185 unique countries/regions during the third quarter of 2013, up 10 over the previous quarter. China, which originated 35 percent of observed attacks, returned to the top spot this quarter after having been unseated by Indonesia in the second quarter. Indonesia, meanwhile, dropped back to second place after originating 20 percent of observed attacks – slightly more than half of the volume seen in the second quarter. The United States remained in third place as it originated 11 percent of observed attacks during the third quarter, up from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter.\nOverall, the concentration of attacks declined during the third quarter of 2013, with the top 10 countries originating 83 percent of observed attacks, compared to 89 percent in the second quarter. China and Indonesia, however, continued to originate more than half of all observed attack traffic.\nAfter dropping to third place in the second quarter, Port 445 (Microsoft-DS) returned to its spot as the most targeted port in the third quarter, drawing 23 percent of observed attacks. Port 80 (WWW [HTTP]) and Port 443 (SSL [HTTPS]) dropped to second and third place at 14 and 13 percent, respectively. Port 445 was the most targeted port in eight of the top 10 countries/regions, the only exceptions being China and Indonesia. Port 1433 (Microsoft SQL Server) was the top target for China and Port 443 was the most targeted from Indonesia.\nIn addition to observations on attack traffic, the State of the Internet Report includes insight into distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks based on reports from Akamai customers. For the first time since the fourth quarter of 2012, when Akamai began reporting on DDoS attacks, fewer attacks were reported than the previous quarter, with 281 observed in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 318 during the second quarter (down 11 percent). Overall, Akamai saw more attacks through the third quarter of 2013 (807) than it did in all of 2012 (768).\nThe Enterprise sector continued to be the leading target of DDoS attacks with 127 reported in the third quarter; Commerce was next with 80, followed by Media & Entertainment (42), Public Sector (18) and High Tech (14).\nAkamai has also started to examine the likelihood that attack targets may be subject to follow-up attacks. Out of the 281 third-quarter attacks, 169 were focused on unique targets. During the quarter, 27 customers were attacked for a second time; five reported three attacks; and seven companies were attacked more than three times. Initial analysis of the data indicates that if a company is the target of a DDoS attack, there is a 25 percent chance that it could be attacked again within three months.\n\"Although the number of DDoS attacks reported by Akamai customers in the third quarter declined from the previous quarter, we believe that 2013 will ultimately be a significantly more active year for DDoS attacks than 2012,\" Belson said. \"As of the end of the third quarter, customers had already reported more DDoS attacks than they did in all of 2012.\"\nMore than 760 million unique IPv4 addresses from 239 unique countries/regions connected to the Akamai Intelligent Platform during the third quarter of 2013, a 1.1 percent increase over the second quarter and an 11 percent increase year over year. Since a single IP address can represent multiple individuals in some cases – such as when users access the Web through a firewall or proxy server – Akamai estimates the total number of unique Web users connecting to its platform during the quarter to be well over one billion.\nThe number of unique IPv4 address seen by the Akamai Intelligent Platform worldwide rose by more than eight million over the quarter, with growth observed in six of the top 10 countries. Year over year, the number of global unique IPv4 addresses connecting to Akamai grew by more than 123 million, with nine of the top 10 countries/regions showing growth.\nFor the first time, the State of the Internet Report includes data leveraged directly from the Akamai Intelligent platform to provide insights into IPv6 adoption across numerous vectors. European countries have taken a clear lead in IPv6 adoption, with seven of the top 10 countries. Conversely, only one country in Asia Pacific (Japan) is among the top 10.\nOver the course of the third quarter of 2013, IPv6 traffic levels on the Akamai Intelligent Platform grew from just over 176,000 hits/second to more than 277,000 hits/second. IPv6 traffic continued to exhibit a cyclical weekly pattern, with volumes dipping each Saturday, likely indicating a greater level of IPv6 adoption across corporate/enterprise networks than consumer ISPs.\nAkamai expects to include this information, as well as insight into IPv6 adoption trends over time, within the State of the Internet Report going forward.\nAverage connection speeds on surveyed mobile network operators during the third quarter of 2013 ranged from a high of 9.5 Mbps to a low of 0.6 Mbps, while average peak connection speeds ranged from 49.8 Mbps to 2.4 Mbps. Eighteen operators showed average connection speeds in the broadband (>4 Mbps) range. According to data collected by Ericsson, the volume of mobile traffic increased by approximately10 percent during the third quarter and grew by 80 percent year over year.\nAnalysis of Akamai IO data collected during the third quarter shows that Android Webkit-based browsers accounted for nearly 38 percent of all requests and Apple Mobile Safari slightly less than 24 percent. When accounting for mobile device usage across all networks (not just cellular), Apple Mobile Safari comprised just over 47 percent of requests and Android Webkit made up 33 percent of requests.\nTo complement the report, Akamai's State of the Internet app was introduced today; a new app that brings the State of the Internet Report to users' iPhones and iPads. The app provides easy access to interactive State of the Internet Report data such as unique IP addresses, attack volume, connection speeds and broadband adoption, along with current and past quarterly reports as well as related news.

{"text":"Most people who support the Bush administration’s generous reinterpretation of the rights of government in the name of fighting terrorism (and many do) do so with the fundamental assumption that they would never be the ones whose civil liberties were yanked out from underneath them. After all, they’re law-abiding citizens who couldn’t possibly be mistaken for terrorist-sympathizers or enemies of the state. Well, the Times‘ article on the far-reaching surveillance conducted by the New York police in the lead-up to the 2004 Republican convention demonstrates how false that assumption is—even for upper-class white heterosexual Christian moderates.\nAttend a meeting of a group opposing Bush or the death penalty or other government policies, or supporting the environment (or, or, or) and the government opens a file on you. Engage in email with these groups and your email will be read and stored. Simply walk down the wrong block in Manhattan during the Republican convention—whether or not you were there to protest, and whether or not your protest was held in violation of any rule or regulation, however minor—and you may have been jailed in the huge dragnet arrests that caused more than 1,800 people to be held for up to 2 days. Not only were many innocent of all charges, but virtually all were charged with violations that would not normally be cause for making a trip down to the station. Few detainees were charged within the legal time limit, and the NYPD failed to respond to the writs of habeas corpus filed on their behalf. Why? So they could get fingerprints of every person being held.\nThis is per the paper of record; it’s no conspiracy theory, though many who have been giving their version of events for more than 2 years have been dismissed as paranoid.\nWhich brings me to my second point. Without the investigative journalism of a serious local paper, this story would never have come to light. In this era of media consolidation [PDF] and profits-first, it pays to remember that. All national news is local somewhere. Investigative journalism, which is time consuming and doesn’t always strike pay dirt, may not make sense in terms of a simple equation of time in: money out, but knowing what your government is up to—well, that’s priceless. And it could easily be your freedom that depends upon it someday, whoever you are.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T02:49:46Z","url":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/03/why-nypds-abuses-matter-you-and-us/"}
{"text":"The US National Security Agency wants a quantum computer – and has dedicated &dollar;79.7 million to the technology, according to the latest top secret government documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to the Washington Post.\nIt is no surprise that the NSA is pursuing such a potentially powerful technology, nor does the revelation pose an immediate privacy threat – the documents suggest that the agency is no closer to perfecting the technology than university researchers around the world. But if the agency does eventually realise its goal, what do citizens need to watch out for? And is there technology that would allow people to stay safe from quantum spooks?\nQuantum computers promise to vastly outperform even the best ordinary computers at specific tasks by exploiting the weird properties of quantum mechanics. While a regular PC computes with bits that are either 0s or 1s, quantum machines use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be both simultaneously, and offer a computational speed-up.\nOne area quantum computers should excel in is factoring numbers into their prime building blocks. That could make them capable of breaking the internet’s most commonly used encryption methods, which depend on the fact that ordinary computers can’t find prime factors quickly. So in principle, the NSA could use a quantum computer to read secret data – without the need to collude with tech firms, which they have done in the past.\nThe NSA programme, called “Penetrating Hard Targets”, apparently aims to build a quantum computer big enough to outperform the conventional variety. However, the Snowden documents, which are dated 2011, only mention aspirations for a machine consisting of two working qubits – far too small to factorise the large numbers that ordinary computers struggle with. It is also smaller than some of the quantum computers that university researchers are working with.\nIt is possible that the NSA has made progress since then, or has other technologies not mentioned in the documents. But Scott Aaronson, a quantum computer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told the Washington Post that he is doubtful that they could be taking the lead yet. “It seems improbable that the NSA could be that far ahead of the open world without anybody knowing it,” he said.\nAnother quantum tool that might interest the NSA is Grover’s algorithm, a database search algorithm that is theoretically much faster than any ordinary software. Snowden’s leaks have revealed that the NSA runs vast data collection programmes, so any way to sift through the noise and quickly identify targets would benefit their efforts.\nHowever, the biggest Grover implementation so far, on a system of three qubits, can only search through eight database elements – in other words, this algorithm is nowhere near outperforming ordinary computers given existing, known quantum hardware.\nHowever, if the NSA does ever manage to build a much bigger quantum computer, there is still one technology that could help keep data secure, and it also relies on quantum mechanics. Quantum key distribution uses photons to generate a sequence of 0s and 1s that serve as an encryption key. Anyone attempting to intercept the key will unavoidably disturb the photons, revealing that the data has been tampered with – the laws of physics keep you safe.\nThis ultra-secure cryptography is already commercially available, and was even used to secure a Swiss election in 2007. But there are limits – building a global quantum network to rival the internet, rather than a small local network, would require technologies that do not exist yet.\nEven if we end up with a secure quantum internet, it is still possible that the NSA might find a way to snoop. Although the underlying physics is secure, physical systems might not be. Quantum hacking is possible by predicting and exploiting flaws that are likely to exist in the way the hardware implements the physics – and the NSA knows it. According to the Snowden documents, one of its research goals is to “support the development of novel Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) attacks and assess the security of new QKD system designs”.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T03:38:02Z","url":"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24812-entangled-spies-why-the-nsa-wants-a-quantum-computer/"}

{"text":"Growing up on Chicago’s North Side, “Rocky” Yamanaka recalled few incidents of racism. “Me and my sister were the only Japanese. But we were curiosities to most of the Caucasians there,” he said.\nFollow the story of “Rocky” Yamanaka, one of the few remaining Nisei who remembers life in Chicago before Japanese American resettlement, from his family’s difficulties in the Great Depression, his experiences in being drafted on V-J Day at the end of World War II, and his return to a Chicago that had drastically changed.\nStill sharp of mind and looking rather spry for an 86-year-old, Yamanaka, with his thin frame and graying hair, remembers a time before World War II when fewer than 400 Japanese Americans called Chicago their home. Currently, there are only a handful of Chicago Nisei from before the war that are still alive today.\nHe was born in 1927 in the U.S. to parents who hailed from near Tokyo. His father first arrived in Chicago as a houseboy living with an American family in the early 1900s. Eventually obtaining an education and opening up a restaurant in the downtown area of Chicago, his father later married his mother and brought her back to the U.S. They would have two sons and two daughters, and Rocky was the third-oldest of his siblings.\nThe diner owned by his father was on Clark Street near Chicago Avenue, and served American fare typical of the many restaurants run by Nisei at the time, since an American audience for Japanese food had not developed in the 1920s and 1930s. But following the Great Depression, his father would eventually lose the restaurant, though he ended up working for another Nikkei restaurateur.\nBy this time his family had moved from the south end of downtown and settled in a crowded, coal-heated two-flat in the Geneva Terrace neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. Walking a block and a half to Lincoln Elementary School, he went to classes in a predominantly Caucasian community.\nHis childhood memories included playing “kitten ball” (also known as “mushball,” a form of 16-inch softball popular in Chicago) with Caucasian neighborhood kids. Early on he evinced a talent for drawing, and even received a summer scholarship to take a class at the Art Institute of Chicago.\nYet through his childhood, experiences of racism on the basis of his Japanese ancestry seemed rare, perhaps owing to the fact that the small Nikkei community was not seen as much of a threat in Chicago compared to areas on the West Coast, where virulent anti-Japanese sentiment had been the norm.\nThough his childhood friends tended to be Caucasian, he does remember attending Japanese American events, including community picnics with his family, as well as annual ceremonies honoring the Japanese emperor’s birthday held on the South Side of Chicago. Another important memory involved going with a large group of Japanese to the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair to see the Japanese Pavilion there, and having iced green tea for the first time, a relative novelty at the time.\nWhen Rocky turned ten years old, his older brother developed rheumatic fever, a common childhood illness of the period. His brother ended up being treated at the La Rabida Sanitarium in Jackson Park (now the La Rabida Children’s Hospital), and since his family didn’t have a car, it would take them hours by streetcars to go that far south. Later his brother returned home and though bedridden for a while, recovered enough to go to school. Despite his seeming recovery, his condition worsened and he passed away in May 1938.\nFollowing the passing of his brother, his mother got ill for a long time, and then when she recovered, his father also got sick, due to an ulcer exacerbated by these family stresses. Rocky’s father would eventually pass away in December 1939. Both his father and brother were interred at Montrose Cemetery, one of the few cemeteries that accepted Japanese American remains for interment.\nThrough assistance from the Japanese Mutual Aid Society of Chicago, his family eventually stayed in an apartment on Oak Street that the association ran. This experience provided his first significant exposure to the Nikkei community and through his time there he met other Nisei like himself.\nHe would eventually learn a little of the Japanese alphabet there but never learned to speak Japanese like some of his Nisei friends. They stayed at the association from about 1939 through 1941, before his mother finally found employment.\nWhen Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, his family still lived at the association. Though he was only 14 years old at the time, he can still recall his thoughts today.\nLacking a strong family connection to Japan and being situated in the Midwest, the unfolding of the war seemed somewhat far away to Rocky as he went to high school.\nAfter his mother got a job they were able to rent a place on nearby Wells Street. His mother faced a great deal of difficulty in picking up after his father passed away, but she eventually worked in the restaurant business and ended up managing a restaurant after a couple of years, demonstrating her tenacity in the face of their family struggles.\nDuring this time he attended Waller High School (now called Lincoln Park High School), first at the Waller branch before transferring to the main school for his last two years. At this school he met a number of other Nisei who attended as well.\nBy the time that he graduated high school in the spring of 1944, he fully expected that he would be drafted into the war effort.\nDespite the war ending, Rocky still had to get inducted to fulfill his Selective Service duties. As he noted, he and his fellow enlistees were supposed to be sent to nearby Fort Sheridan by noon of that day.\nFollowing this, the Army sent him to Camp Fannin in Tyler, Texas, where supplies ran low due to the consolidation of the armed forces at the end of the war. Three months later the Army transferred him to Fort Snelling in Minnesota, but since he couldn’t speak Japanese he couldn’t join the Military Intelligence Service (MIS) program. By the end of his service he ended up at the Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) school at Camp Holabird in Maryland and joined the art department, becoming a staff sergeant, and the head non-commissioned officer there.\nIn 1947 he finished his military service. Still only 20 years old, he found that his hometown had drastically changed.\nIn speaking about the Nikkei that ended up resettling in Chicago from the Japanese American concentration camps, “Even before I got drafted they started coming into this area out of the camps. A lot of them moved to the South Side, like the Hyde Park area.” By 1947, the number of Nikkei in Chicago had rocketed to some 20,000 people.\nLater he went to art school on the G.I. Bill and started a career as an illustrator at an art studio run by a former Disney animator.\nAll told, however, the Nikkei community had changed drastically from what he had known before. “The pre-war community no longer existed when I came back,” he said. “I never did have a community, because I lived in a Caucasian neighborhood, but I had to move into a Nisei group. Then I went in the Army and came back and the Nisei group was completely changed from what I remembered from two years before.\nDespite the changes that have taken place in the Nikkei community of Chicago, Rocky continues to live as an embodiment of an era now gone, but for him, and thankfully because of him, it will not be forgotten.\nRyan Masaaki Yokota is editor of Nikkei Chicago, a website devoted to telling the untold stories of Japanese Americans in the Windy City.

{"text":"Regular listeners to our weekly TechRadio podcast will know all about 3D in the home – for simplicity let’s call it H3D. Over the past five years we discussed it as an emerging technology, a mature technology and, this year, an industry folly. It’s not that we’re modish, it’s that H3D’s stakeholders in manufacturing and media failed to address the three ‘c’s of cost, convenience and content that have defined the format wars of the last 30 years. Where 3D in the cinema – C3D for our purposes – has proven popular as a premium offering for multiplexes, the same enthusiasm has not crossed over to H3D where consumers don’t have massive screens with digital projection, cutting-edge sound systems and a, most import, a communal viewing experience. C3D is popular because it delivers on all those fronts and viewers haven’t grown tired of paying the extra €2 or €3 to catch a summer blockbuster in a prime time slot. Would anyone care tomorrow if C3D disappeared? I have yet to meet anyone who said it enhanced their enjoyment of a story.\nAlthough we’re stuck with C3D for the foreseeable future, the rules for home entertainment have always been different, the assumption H3D would follow the same path as C3D has proven disastrous. In the video format war of the early 1980s, VHS (developed by JVC) smashed (Sony’s) Betamax as it was cheaper to produce and better manufacturer support. In the 90s, DVD beat VHS without resistance by delivering superior quality at comparable prices at a fraction of the size of a video cassette with broad manufacturer support.\nIn the noughties, Sony’s Blu-ray and Toshiba’s HD DVD echoed the struggle of 20 years previous, only this time around it was content deals via Sony’s industry partnerships, not demand and price, that carried the day. However, consumers haven’t taken to Blu-ray owing to higher prices, limited selection and changing viewing patterns in favour of on-demand services delivering mostly standard definition content. With home H3D dependent on Blu-ray adoption its best is a subset of a minority interest format. And that’s before we get to the hardware.\nManufacturers have spent the past four years extolling the virtues of H3D, treating it as an inevitable evolution of home cinema systems, however the sales of 3D TVs have proved unconvincing. Studios are apparently reluctant to support H3D as it would detract from C3D revenue and Internet-connected TVs with direct access to catch-up and on-demand services are proving far more popular and cost-effective. And, of course, there is the issue of having to wear expensive active shutter glasses to get the best H3D picture.\nPanasonic, Samsung, Sony and LG still promote 3D sets on their websites but the current slate of offline advertising campaigns has put the focus on picture quality and better user experience through gesture control and Internet connectivity. Sony, however, is looking beyond H3D to refocus on picture quality: ultra-HD – or 4K – TVs.\nHowever, the final blow to H3D was delivered last week when broadcasters ESPN and BBC decided they would no longer be producing 3D content. Sky’s commitment remains but with no further players committing to broadcast the content end of the argument seems to be wrapped up.\nOverpriced and underserved, H3D will be seen as a failure driven by industry hype over consumer demand. Will we see the same pattern with HD and 4K over the next few years? Let’s see how many lessons have been learned this time around.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T22:13:32Z","url":"https://www.techcentral.ie/h3d-rip/"}
{"text":"In the Wednesday morning quarterbacking after Hillary Clinton’s unexpected loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race, one criticism was that she had not employed that consummate politician former President Bill Clinton enough in her campaign, to speak to “the people” he could connect with and she could not.\nBut for all the mistakes the Clinton 2016 campaign operation and the candidate herself made — and there were plenty — sidelining Bill was not one of them.\nThe star of the presidential wunderkind of the 1990s already had become tarnished, his political mojo faded in the new century. Hillary perhaps had remembered how he stole the show — and not in a good way — during her 2008 presidential run, when he wore his joking “first black president” moniker into the ground with the Democratic Party’s most loyal base and his antics in the South Carolina primary ennobled rather than diminished the first-term African-American senator named Barack Obama.\nWhen she did employ her husband during her competitive 2016 primary fight with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, perhaps in search of that old Clinton magic, rather than feel potential voters’ pain, he wagged a defensive finger as he lectured young activists protesting his 1994 crime bill and its consequences of mass incarceration that haunt the country still.\nSince Hillary Clinton had already apologized for her 1996 sound bite calling young offenders “super predators,” finding other tasks for her scene-stealing husband was probably a wise call.\nEven when Bill was not front and center, his presence at a debate loomed even larger than a hovering Donald Trump, whose campaign sat his accusers of sexual misconduct (Bill’s not Donald’s) in the audience.\nAfter Bill Clinton’s latest return to the media spotlight, competitive Democrats hoping to capture the House and praying for a chance at a Senate majority might be wishing he had not picked this moment to embark on a book tour and find a way to land smack in the middle of a #MeToo movement — and not in a good way.\nIn an NBC interview that, like a wreck on the side of the road, was difficult to turn away from, it was clear that the times — and on reflection, Bill Clinton’s place in them — have changed. It’s not just some policies, such as maximum-minimum sentencing, that have curdled.\nSurprisingly for someone once judged so astute, Clinton seemingly had not anticipated Craig Melvin’s questions on Monica Lewinsky. Instead of saying he apologized then and remains sorry today, a reasonable outreach even if he felt unfairly blindsided, the former president leaned in to defend himself, note his $16 million in legal fee debt and compare the media circus surrounding his personal scandals to the attention paid to the transgressions of the current White House occupant.\nThat Clinton charm was nowhere to be found.\nIt’s true that Donald Trump faces his own litany of accusers, including former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos, now suing the president for defamation (a judge has ruled Trump can be deposed), a profane “Access Hollywood” tape, and a Cabinet and staff marked by accusations of incompetence and corruption — with EPA chief Scott Pruitt and the Russia investigation making daily headlines.\nClinton’s supporters would take his flaws over Trump’s mountain of political and personal indignities, especially if you throw in more judges such as Clinton Supreme Court pick Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nBut a game of “whataboutism” and a reminder from Bill Clinton of all the women he hired and promoted does not excuse Clinton’s reckless behavior with a White House intern in her 20s when he was the president of the United States. Saying that two-thirds of the American people were on your side makes you sound a little too much like another president who measures success by crowd size and ratings.\nLewinsky has found her public voice in recent years, in a TED Talk on shame and bullying, and a Vanity Fair article recognizing the power imbalance in a relationship she nevertheless and forthrightly has owned as consensual. She has earned it after a life upended and then reclaimed, for the years in which she certainly paid a higher price than the adult president in the room.\nHer words resonate with a generation of women and men who are discussing relationships — healthy, toxic and in-between — and finding their way on what is and is not acceptable at work and in life. And they vote. Few of these voters have any nostalgia or patience for Bill Clinton and have moved on to craving new voices and politicians.\nOn CNN, Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, when asked about Clinton’s TV appearance, said the former president should make things right with Lewinsky: “I was raised that when you screw up and you make a mistake, you say sorry, and if it’s not good enough for the person you are apologizing to, you keep saying sorry until they feel comfortable and you are recognizing that you made a mistake.” Clinton has followed his initial words with versions of a walk-back — on CNN and in a visit with Stephen Colbert — but if he thought he would get a pass, he was mistaken.\nAny hope for a Democratic wave in the fall depends on enthusiasm from women and young voters who are looking to the future rather than the past. The result of Tuesday’s primaries in California and other states show tough races across the country. So expect Bill Clinton to be the invisible man on the campaign trail, as nervous Democrats who want to offer fresh ideas show little interest in half-hearted apologies from a tainted surrogate.\nBill Clinton himself has acknowledged that much has changed in 20 years — in a good way.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T12:29:06Z","url":"https://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/bill-clinton-campaigning-democrats"}
{"text":"A small VoIP company has had to change its name after being threatened with legal action over its use of the word ‘cloud’ in its name by European Wi-Fi network The Cloud.\nFacing a High Court case, Cloudnet Telecommunications decided to avoid potentially heavy legal costs and give itself the new name by which it is now known, Birchills Telecom.\nThe two companies don’t compete directly but had vaguely similar registered names, Cloudnet Telecommunications Ltd, founded in 2009, and The Cloud Networks Ltd, founded in 2003.\n“We were told by The Cloud’s legal team to simply change our name in case The Cloud decided, at a later date, to sell telephone systems,” said Birchills Telecom founder, Dave Hill.\nDespite the name similarity, a check on Companies House register reveals many dozens of companies using the word ‘cloud’ in their names, including some that operate in the computing sphere, so Birchills now believes there could be a less obvious motive for the threat – bad SEO on Google.\nHill’s company was first contacted by The Cloud in August 2010, days after he noticed the latter suffering in Google search returns.\n“We provide business phone systems and cannot be simply mistaken for the Wi-Fi hotspot provider, and were in no way trying to pass ourselves off as them. We have now had to invest in changing our branding, marketing materials, emails and more, while keeping our customers happy and informed of the changes,” adds a miffed Hill.\nThe company would have fought the demand had it been able to afford the legal costs, which Hill believes would have run to a six-figure sum for each day at the High Court.\nThe SEO theory is hard to assess retrospectively. Running a Google UK search today will overwhelmingly return Wi-Fi giant ‘The Cloud’ depending on the precise cloud-related term entered. If the company found itself usurped by a separate company finessing Google’s algorithms to get a higher entry that could easily have caused pique. The term ‘cloud’ is generic which makes standing out in search returns that much harder to begin with.\nWhat Birchills, formerly Cloudnet Telecommunications, has been canny about is generating publicity out of its enforced name change.\nThe Cloud was asked to comment on the story but had not replied at press time.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T06:40:58Z","url":"https://www.computerworlduk.com/it-vendors/voip-company-changes-name-after-the-cloud-legal-threat-3265410/"}

{"text":"Mike Huckabee reacted Sunday on \"Fox & Friends\" to former Secretary of State John Kerry holding private meetings with Iranian officials.\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry is being slammed for conducting shadow diplomacy with Iran after admitting to multiple meetings with Iranian officials behind the backs of Trump administration officials -- including over the scrapped nuclear deal.\nAn administration official on Thursday told Fox News Kerry’s meetings are \"shameful,\" pointing out what Iranian-backed militias are doing to kill and injure people in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\nOther Republicans suggested it may not even be legal.\n\"John Kerry is the only guy I know who wants to bring back the Edsel, MySpace and other failed enterprises,\" Huckabee (R-Ark.) remarked. \"What he is doing is not funny.\"\nHuckabee said Kerry could be suited for the first successful prosecution of the Logan Act of 1799, which prohibits conducting unauthorized diplomacy with governments in dispute with the United States.\nThe act's name refers to a 1798 incident in which Philadelphia farmer George Logan traveled to France, outside the purview of President John Adams, to try to avoid war during a time of tension over merchant shipping.\nHuckabee said Kerry is violating the \"sense of protocol\" for former U.S. diplomats, and that he is effectively \"negotiating secretly with a foreign government [and] the largest terror sponsor in the world.\"\nKerry responded to previous criticism from President Trump, comparing his demeanor to a teenage girl.\nSome Democrats floated the idea of prosecuting former Trump National Security Adviser Gen.

{"text":"It's no surprise why the keto diet has grown in popularity over the last few years; it's helped people lose weight, can fight inflammation, and may even be good for those with diabetes. But with the diet's focus on eating high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carb meals, some people are concerned with how it will affect their blood pressure. After all, foods such as bacon, pastrami, and other deli meats that are allowed on the diet aren't recommended for people with high blood pressure.\nTurns out the keto diet can actually be beneficial for those with high blood pressure. However, it's not because of the diet itself; weight loss, which results from the keto diet, will improve blood pressure.\n\"Being overweight or obese is one of the major triggers for an increase in blood pressure,\" cardiologist and weight-management specialist Luiza Petre, MD, told POPSUGAR. One study from 2011 found that up to 80 percent of hypertension cases in Poland are related to being overweight or obese. Dr. Petre added that overweight and obese people who lose weight have a 50 percent chance of reversing their blood pressure without medication.\nAnd a keto diet can be an effective way to lose weight; a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who followed a low-carb ketogenic diet lost more weight compared to those who followed a low-fat diet.\n\"The bottom line is the ketogenic diet will improve blood pressure, but not as a direct effect. It's through its indirect weight-loss benefits,\" she said. \"If the keto diet is done without a weight-loss goal, it might not impact blood pressure at all. Losing weight remains the number one intervention, followed by lowering salt and exercising to improve blood pressure.\" Dr. Petre added that the keto diet will lower blood pressure thanks to the weight loss, not because of the ketones in the blood as a result of being in ketosis.\nHowever, the keto diet may not be the best one for weight loss for those with high blood pressure. Nieca Goldberg, MD, medical director of the Joan H. Tisch Center For Women's Health at NYU Langone Medical Center, recommends the DASH diet instead. The DASH diet stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, which is a Mediterranean-style diet that's rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and lean meat and low in salt. She also said to avoid processed foods for blood pressure, since they can be high in salt, and instead to eat antioxidant-rich produce.\nIf you are thinking about trying the keto diet, be sure to consult with a doctor or dietitian before making any drastic dietary changes.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T21:03:05Z","url":"https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Keto-Diet-High-Blood-Pressure-44998899"}

{"text":"As Felipe Anderson bore down on Joe Hart's goal, he hardly had the look of your stereotypical record signing shorn of confidence.\nWest Ham's £40million summer buy from Lazio had his form critiqued by his manager in public last week, was hauled off at half-time against Tottenham and has had a small section of critics in the crowd on his back.\nNo bother. Anderson gave Hart the eyes, poked the ball through his legs to make it 2-1 and then went on to score a second in the thrilling victory over Burnley on Saturday.\nIf Pellegrini's talk of not being 'happy' with the Brazilian's performances was viewed from outside as a form of tough love, Anderson probably thought otherwise.\nHe has been through worse: as recently as February Lazio boss Simone Inzaghi dumped the 25-year-old into the reserves after a dressing-room row.\nPrivately, Pellegrini has been trying to coax the best out of the player they called 'Neymar's younger brother' back in Brazil.\nThe Chilean coach had told Anderson there was no chance he would be dropped, despite a slow start to life in the Premier League.\nNow, West Ham are reaping the rewards. Their most talented playmaker since Dimitri Payet tore Burnley apart with the help of 20-year-old Grady Diangana on the opposite flank.\nWatching Anderson in full flow was a real joy: two goals, a shot cleared off the line, another off the post, deft touches and turns galore.\nHis talent is obvious but needs to be nurtured and Pellegrini seems to have found a way to do so. If this sort of showing can be replicated more regularly, West Ham can boast two of the best forward talents outside the top six in Anderson and Marko Arnautovic.\nThat makes it all the more impressive that Diangana, in only his second start, did not look out of place alongside them in Pellegrini's front three.\nBorn in Congo but raised in London, the latest talent off West Ham's production line looks the part and is not short of confidence.\n'I've always liked to beat players and tried to entertain people,' Diangana said afterwards. His idol is Ronaldinho and there is little fear in a player who never stopped running at defenders.\nThat was key to this victory, with the youngster having a hand in both of Anderson's goals, sandwiched by Arnautovic's opener and Javier Hernandez's stoppage-time clincher.\nBurnley were comfortably second best and their two levellers, scored by Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Chris Wood, were both against the run of play.\nManager Sean Dyche is convinced their dip compared to last season's seventh-place finish comes down to the small margins. 'I told you we weren't the real deal then,' Dyche said. There is still plenty of time for Burnley to turn things around.\nBut for West Ham the upward momentum is on. As stand-in captain Pablo Zabaleta put it: 'This is the only way for the manager to play.' Anderson and Diangana are just two beneficiaries.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T00:29:17Z","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-6352273/Felipe-Anderson-dashes-gear-West-Ham-star-not-quick-Pablo-Zabaleta.html"}
{"text":"September 3, 2014: The ferocity with which some Western (and nearly all Arab) military analysts attack Israeli efforts to defend themselves is remarkable, and often spectacularly wrong. Even Israeli systems that are purely defensive are subject to ferocious, and usually false, criticism. One of the worst recent examples were the critics who claimed that it was technically impossible for the Israeli Iron Dome anti-rocket system to shoot down Palestinian rockets aimed at populated areas. Even after other technical experts pointed out the technical and statistical flaws in these criticisms the claims kept coming. Israelis didn’t much care since each day (and night) of the recent war with Hamas anyone in southern Israel could see Iron Dome in action and doing what it was designed to do. Despite all the long range rockets fired at distant (but much larger) cities, none hit and many were spectacularly destroyed before many witnesses by Iron Dome.\nThe Israelis believe in Iron Dome, so much so that because of some decisions earlier in the year Israel was, in the week after the war began, to increase the number of Iron Dome anti-rocket missile batteries by 43 percent (from seven to ten). Israel has long wanted fifteen batteries of Iron Dome but that was going to cost more than Israel could afford. Earlier this year the U.S. agreed to help out and Iron Dome production was immediately increased. Earlier, between 2009 and July 2014, Israel received eight Iron Dome batteries and about two thousand Tamir missiles. Even so over a thousand Tamir missiles had been used (the end of June 2013) since the system entered regular service in 2011. The latest war with Hamas began on July 8th as Hamas ceased even pretending to halt the rocket attacks (by non-Hamas Islamic terrorists) on Israel coming out of Gaza. Hamas began firing a lot more rockets and the seven Iron Dome batteries in service were the primary defense against a rocket hitting an inhabited area. One additional battery had already been delivered but was not activated yet.\nAt that point Israelis really, really wanted more Iron Domes batteries. So the air force and the manufacturers went to work. Inventory was checked and it was found that there was enough equipment in stock (newly manufactured, used for development work or almost completed) to quickly equip two more batteries. Because there were already seven batteries active and personnel had been selected, trained and assembled for the new eighth battery it was calculated that by prying away a few key people from each of the eight existing batteries, activating reservists with Iron Dome experience, using some contractor personnel (civilians who had worked on Iron Dome even if they had not done so while in the military) and calling in some military personnel with similar skills (maintenance, operations) to those used by Iran Dome crews the new batteries could be staffed. By speeding up the training and certification of the eighth battery as well as the newly formed two batteries all were in action in a week or less. The eighth and ninth batteries went online by the 11th and the tenth battery was active by the 15th. Military and contractor personnel. Instructors and the new crews had to work round the clock for over a week to make it happen. More manufacturing personnel were brought in to speed up production of the Tamir missiles and components for the radars and fire control systems. Iron Dome is nearly 90 percent effective in destroying rockets headed for inhabited areas.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T06:20:06Z","url":"https://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htiw/articles/20140903.aspx"}
{"text":"“We have to get the word out to parents and friends that we have an issue that needs addressed,” Dershem said.\nTaking questions from the crowd, the panel of six, moderated by Penn State Evidence-Based Prevention and Intervention Support Center Managing Director Stephanie Bradley, spoke on subjects ranging from the definition of addiction to the stigma of addiction to mental health.\nMNMC Emergency Medical Services Director Dr. Kassandra Botti said addiction to heroin or opiates has been proven to be an addiction and not a lifestyle choice — a belief that continues to circulate. This lifestyle belief helps fuel the stigma of addiction, preventing many from seeking help for fear of judgment.\nCounty Drug and Alcohol Services Assistant Director Cathy Arbogast echoed this, saying that when a person abuses a substance, it works in the same areas of the brain where base activities like breathing and eating are. The addiction takes over so much of the brain that it becomes difficult to make other choices.\nPennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs communications Director Jason Snyder, himself a recovering addict who lost both his brothers to their own addictions, said peer-to-peer testimonial is the best way to overcome the stigma of addiction. Addiction affects everyone, he said, and the mission is to step forward.\nAddressing myths surrounding heroin, Crossroads Counseling recovery specialist Katie Hugo — herself a recovered addict — said people have to stop thinking that addiction or an addict looks a certain way. She said she’s helped treat everyone from teens to professional-aged adults.\nState College police Officer Adam Salyards dispelled the notion that if the police receive a tip about someone dealing or taking heroin, that the person will be arrested immediately. Police must establish evidence before an arrest, and will work with detectives or the county drug task force before approaching someone with charges, he said.\nRep. Kerry Benninghoff, R-Bellefonte, said the issue must be looked at as a health issue and not just a crime issue.\n“In society, if you have heart pains, you go to the hospital and they don’t send you home,” he said. “But when it comes to addiction problems, they treat you and send you out.\n“We have to look at the underlying issue — why do people keep doing this?” he said.\nThe panel also touched on the use of naloxone — also called Narcan — and its use in battling overdoses. It counters the opioid, Botti said, stopping the effects of the drugs, and is carried by police, EMS and is readily available to residents who seek it through most drug stores.\nSalyards said he personally administered a dose of naloxone to an individual about two weeks ago, saving the person’s life.\n“It’s a good collaboration between law enforcement and health care,” he said.\nCounty Commissioners provided closing comments, noting that the panel discussion is a great first step but the epidemic will only slow if everyone participates. A second panel discussion focusing on treatment and recovery is slated for September.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T16:49:24Z","url":"https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/article92049362.html"}

{"text":"NEW YORK — For a second year in a row, the NFL will air a dramatic PSA during the Super Bowl addressing the issue of domestic violence.\nThis year’s video shows a succession of text messages between two friends. One friend is encouraging another named Jess to attend a Super Bowl party, but Jess says she can’t come because “Jake is in one of his moods. I should prob not go out.” The alarmed friend asks if Jess is okay. Jess never answers.\nThe video, like the one aired during Super Bowl 49, was created by NoMore.org, an educational campaign raising awareness about domestic violence.\nLast year’s video featured footage of a home that had clearly been the scene of an attack. A woman’s 911 call, discretely asking for help, can be heard as the rooms of the partially destroyed home are shown.\nThat group’s PSA came on the heels of embarrassing domestic violence cases involving NFL stars and criticism of the way the league handled them. The most notorious case involved Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, seen in a hotel video knocking out his girlfriend, who later became his wife. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell came under fire for the way in which Rice’s situation was handled: the player was only required to sit out two games. After film of Rice hitting the woman surfaced, Goodell said that the two game suspension had been a mistake, and he made the suspension indefinite.\nDuring the 2015 season, photos emerged of bruises on the ex-girlfriend of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy following a 2014 incident. Hardy was convicted of assault, but those charges were dropped on appeal when the ex-girlfriend stopped cooperating with prosecutors.\nThe Cowboys rejected suggestions that Hardy be cut from the team.\nThe 30 second NoMore commercial will air during the third quarter of Super Bowl 50.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T05:23:29Z","url":"https://kdvr.com/2016/02/04/nfl-will-air-domestic-violence-psa-during-super-bowl/"}

He proposed a potential solution.\nOther Influencers acknowledged benefits of rent control, but still expressed reservations about its pitfalls.\n“The judicious use and expansion of rent control can and will hold rents down, but unfortunately it will also reduce the number of new rental units built as investors fear they will not be able to gain from their dollars,” said California Democratic Party Chairman Eric Bauman.\nBut Manuel Pastor, Director of USC’s Program for Environmental and Regional Equity, pointed to potential economic advantages of rent control.\nMichele Siquieros, president of the Campaign for College Opportunity, attempted to reconcile the two perspectives, advocating for rent control but pointing out it is only one aspect of an comprehensive affordable housing strategy.\n“The reality is that California needs both limits on rent increases that allow low-income and middle-income families the ability to stay housed AND we need major investments in building (denser) housing to address challenges by both public and private investors,” she said.\nThe attorney for the adult children who were tortured and abused by their California parents for years says they're trying to live their lives as normally as possible and each is grappling with how much they're willing to forgive.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T21:11:20Z","url":"https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/state/california/article218407735.html"}

Arnold Pakula, a fifth-grade teacher at the Highland Oaks Elementary School in Dade County, Fla., reached that point after a number of shootings of teenagers in his area.\nAt the time, he was serving on the board of the local parent-teacher association. The group's discussion turned to the problems of kids with guns, ``and I said, I really need to do something in my fifth-grade class,'' Mr. Pakula says.\nSo he wrote a play about the accidental death, by gunshot, of a young student.

{"text":"INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly will get more than $7 million in tax relief from the City of Indianapolis over the next decade.\nThe Indianapolis City-County Council approved Monday night about $7.1 million in tax abatements to the pharmaceutical company over the next 10 years. The abatements come as part of a multimillion-dollar investment into a building on Eli Lilly’s campus near Kentucky Avenue.\nThe investment is a $91 million expansion to the Lilly Technology Center – South first announced in 2017. It includes more than 22,000 square feet of building retrofit and 12,000 square feet of new building construction.\nThe proposal for the abatements passed the full council 19-6. Those who voted no were Democrats Zach Adamson, Stephen Clay, Jared Evans and Christina Scales. The Republicans who voted no were Marilyn Pfisterer and Susie Cordi.\nAdamson was the lone councilor who voted no on the proposal when it was in committee a week ago. At the time, there was still confusion on how much the Eli Lilly custodial staff is being paid. Eli Lilly has said that the custodial staff is contracted out to another company, and the pharmaceutical company isn’t in charge of determining the custodians’ pay.\nAdamson said the contracting company has maintained that they are paying the custodians as much as they can with the agreement with Eli Lilly. His questions about the pay didn’t get answered.\n“[Eli Lilly] still maintains they don’t have any role in that, and that’s disappointing,” Adamson said.\nAdamson participated in a protest with custodial staff in October 2018 for higher pay.\nHe also voted no because Eli Lilly has not committed any new jobs with the expansion. He warned against the trend of companies asking for tax relief to develop or even stay in the area.\nThe building’s improvements will allow Eli Lilly to better produce insulin products, a company representative said. The last tax abatements Eli Lilly received were in 2017, which totaled about $9.3 million over 10 years.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T23:10:11Z","url":"https://www.theindychannel.com/news/politics/they-dont-need-it-tax-relief-for-eli-lilly-passes-city-county-council-despite-no-votes-and-pushback"}

His spokesman Sean Spicer has twice stepped into the fray himself, including on Tuesday, when he doubled down on Trump's false claim that he lost the popular vote because 3 million to 5 million people living in the U.S. illegally cast ballots.\n\"He believes what he believes based on the information he was provided,\" said Spicer, who provided no evidence to back up the president's statements. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have finalized their election results with no reports of the kind of widespread fraud that Trump is alleging.\nIf the president's claim were true it would mark the most significant election fraud in U.S. history - and ironically, would raise the same questions about Trump's legitimacy that he's trying to avoid. Yet Spicer repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether the Trump administration would investigate the allegations pushed by the president.\nSome Trump allies say Trump is justified in using his platform to defend his standing. They point to Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis' pre-inauguration statement that he did not see Trump as a legitimate president, as well as U.S. intelligence agencies' assessment that Russia meddled in the election in order to help Trump win.\n\"Segments of his own government keep driving this narrative,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime confidant. \"I don't think it hurts to point it out.\"\nKey advisers in Trump's inner circle concede the focus on crowd claims and alleged voter fraud have been a distraction. But who's going to stop him from airing his complaints?\nAfter relishing in Friday's inaugural festivities, the new president grew increasingly upset the next day by what he felt was \"biased\" media coverage of women's marches across the globe protesting his election, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Trump was particularly enraged with CNN, which he thought was \"gloating\" by continually running photos of the women's march alongside the smaller crowds that attended his inauguration the day before, according to this person, one of several White House aides and associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\nTuesday night on Twitter, Trump slammed CNN again, referring to the network as \"FAKE NEWS @CNN\" while praising rival Fox News Channel.\nTrump has had a tumultuous relationship with the press, frequently calling the media dishonest and insulting individual reporters by name at his rallies and on Twitter. Still, two people close to Trump said he expected his coverage to turn more favorable once he took office. Instead, he's told people he believes it's gotten worse.\nThe bad press over the weekend has not allowed Trump to \"enjoy\" the White House as he feels he deserves, according to one person who has spoken with him.\nThe result has been a full display of Trump's propensity for exaggeration and more. During an appearance at the CIA Saturday, he wrongly said the inaugural crowds gathered on the National Mall stretched to the Washington Monument, despite clear photo evidence to the contrary. And during a reception with lawmakers from both parties Monday night, he repeated his false assertion that millions of illegal immigrants provided Hillary Clinton's margin in the popular vote.\nIt's not the first time that Trump, who is known to be both thin-skinned and dedicated to polishing his public image, has become fixated on details that challenge his success. When journalist Timothy O'Brien wrote in a 2005 book that Trump was a multimillionaire, not a billionaire, the real estate mogul sued him for $5 billion. The case was dismissed. Trump appealed, accusing the journalist of libel. He lost that, too.\nSpicer hinted at Trump's feelings during his maiden press briefing on Monday.\n\"There is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has,\" Spicer said. \"And I think that it's just unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough, it's not good enough, you can't win.\"\nLess than one week into the administration, Spicer has twice been sent to the White House briefing room to reiterate his boss' message. Trump is said to have approved of Spicer's angry tirade against the media on Saturday, which included false statements about the size of inaugural crowds. But the president, who is intensely focused on optics, was said to be critical of Spicer's on-camera image.\nBy Monday, Spicer was donning a darker suit and his lectern in the briefing room had been lowered somewhat.\nUnderscoring Trump's habit of stoking rivalries among his staff, he has told people he wants his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, to be on television more. He cheered her use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" in a recent interview as a way to counteract what he believes is the media's inherent bias.\nThose around Trump are trying to get the cable news consumer-in-chief to be near a television less often, according to one person who has spoken with him.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T04:46:06Z","url":"https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/national/political/story/2017/jan/25/trump-dogged-insecurity-over-popular-vote-med/409397/"}
{"text":"The reinstatement of the “Global Gag Rule” means poor women in foreign countries will have narrower access to contraception and other health-care services.\nTwo days after millions of women and their allies throughout the world took to the streets to protest the bigotry and misogyny of Donald Trump, the president sat in the Oval Office, surrounded by other men, and signed an executive order that could have dire consequences for women living abroad.\nThe United States provides more funding for women’s health services than any other country. For health providers that receive that aid, the gag rule forces them to limit their services, or face a major budget gap. In other words, health organizations that provide a whole range of essential services besides abortion get punished. For women, it means narrower access not just to abortion but also to contraception, which in many poor countries is largely funded by foreign donors. Disruptions in aid put women at greater risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and make them more likely to resort to unsafe abortions. More than 1,327 communities in Ghana, for instance, were affected after George W. Bush reinstated the rule in 2001, forcing Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana to forgo $200,000 in USAID funding and cut its nursing staff by 44 percent, according to Population Action International. In Kenya, two leading reproductive health–care providers were forced to close a total of 17 clinics. Contraceptive shipments from the US to 16 countries—primarily in Africa—stopped completely.\nGiven the history of the gag rule, Trump’s rush to reinstate it is not a surprise. But that doesn’t diminish the significance of the order for millions of women and their families. The two largest recipients of family-planning funding from USAID, Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation, announced Monday that they won’t comply with the reinstated policy. IPPF, which will lose $100 million as a result, promised to “work with governments and donors to bridge the funding and service gaps the Global Gag Rule creates.” But even if the money materializes from another source, it will take time, leaving women—particularly poor and rural women—at risk to disruptions in access to care. MSI (which often works in unstable and emergency settings, such as in Nepal after the deadly 2015 earthquake) will lose $30 million, or about 20 percent of its annual budget. The organization estimates the shortfall could, during Trump’s first term, lead to 6.5 million unintended pregnancies, 2.2 million abortions, 2.1 million unsafe abortions, and the deaths of 21,700 pregnant women.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T00:21:08Z","url":"https://www.thenation.com/article/trumps-anti-abortion-order-is-actually-likely-to-increase-abortions/"}

Comics movie.\nFrom left, from Warner Bros./Everett Collection, Warner Bros/DC Comics/Rex/Shutterstock, courtesy of Warner Bros.\nIn 2015, Warner Bros. hired makeup artist Alessandro Bertolazzi for the most intimidating challenge of his three-decade career: making over the Joker, a pop culture icon, for Suicide Squad. Granted, the supervillain (played this time by Jared Leto) did not get as much screen time as the film’s titular team. But as the most-famous character featured in Suicide Squad, the 67-year-old, green-haired villain, who has appeared in thousands of comic books and been famously portrayed onscreen by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, was the speculative fixation of many comic fans. (Bertolazzi was startled to discover that the Internet was already guessing how his Suicide Squad Joker would look before he started work on the film.) So, how did Bertolazzi prep for the much-anticipated makeover?\nBertolazzi gathered other inspirational materials, including everyday items—sawdust, wood, stone—photos, newspaper clippings, Internet images, and anything else that inspired him.\nWhen it came time to put makeup brush to skin, Bertolazzi and the filmmakers made the decision to keep the Joker separate from the rest of the Suicide Squad cast by putting everyone in separate makeup trailers.\nIt was David Ayer’s idea to give the Joker a scar. Bertolazzi expanded on that idea by giving him seven.\nDespite the intimidating challenge he faced, Bertolazzi was satisfied with how the studio trusted him to experiment and take the movie’s most prized character into his literal hands.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T14:45:55Z","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/the-joker-suicide-squad-makeup"}
{"text":"By Kathie Klarreich Kathie Klarreich, a journalist who lives in Haiti, is cofounder of Caribbean Exchange, a San Francisco-based education and action group.\nHAITIAN President General Prosper Avril completed a year in office Sept. 17. He has managed to survive several coup attempts, a crippling economic decline, and an increase in the random violence that drains the country morally and materially. The same hope that sprang up in February 1986 when Jean Claude Duvalier fled the country reappeared when Mr. Avril took office. There was some general housecleaning, as low-ranking soldiers ousted superiors with Duvalierist ties. But Avril himself, with 30 years of service to the Duvalier regime, was suspect. People took a wait-and-see attitude.\nNow even Avril's most vocal critics acknowledge certain improvements. Most recently, the president agreed to substantially cut official salaries, and halve his own, to help fight the country's huge deficit. But many promises have yet to be realized. The result is widespread discontent, increased repression, and political instability.\nAlready the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, Haiti's economic situation continues to deteriorate. Coffee, one of Haiti's main exports, can no longer compete on the world market. Currently, Haiti imports nearly twice as much as it exports in order to feed its people. The market is flooded with free or low-cost staple foods that have undercut an already unstable local market.\nIn the capital city, nightly murders, robberies, and rapes force people inside when the sun goes down. Both the elite bourgeois and the penniless beggar are victims of this rising insecurity. One facet of the situation is increased banditry, perhaps a desperate response to the decaying economy. Another is the insidious attempt to keep people from organizing for democratic reform. Most of the rural organizations that formed after Duvalier's departure have collapsed.\nOne significant difference in this current wave of violence is the difficulty of tracing its source. Though there are no fingerprints leading to the National Palace, official passivity and mock investigations suggest some sort of collusion, if not direct involvement.\nIronically, from the beginning Avril has expressed an interest in the transition to a civilian government. He is proud of the Provisional Electoral Council, which this month will announce the electoral calendar. While the government insists on the council's honest intentions and independence, Duvalierist sympathizers and death-squad members have been reported present at several council meetings. These thugs made it clear that, despite a constitutional provision prohibiting anyone linked to Duvalier from participating, they intend to run for office.\nThe US, meanwhile, continues to praise President Avril. The deputy assistant secretary of state for the Caribbean, Richard Melton, recently said the US fully supports the efforts of Avril to move forward on democratic, social, and economic reforms.\nFree and fair elections are a precondition for resumption of US aid, which was cut off after an election-day massacre in November 1987. The US also demands reduced drug trafficking and improved human-rights conditions.\nEncouraged by Haiti's cooperation in drug control, the US recently approved $300,000 to help in this effort. The money will be used to expand the government's ability to track down dealers. Critics, however, question how the money will be kept out of the pockets of government employees, who are themselves often part of the drug trafficking.\nHuman-rights violations are numerous as ever. Illegal arrests average one a day; arbitrary detentions and assassinations are common. In the countryside, the victims are usually members of peasant and church groups and labor unions, and those who participate in political demonstrations.\nWhether as a result of politics or economics, more people than ever are fleeing the country by boat. In the first six months of this year, 20,530 Haitians on some 300 boats were stopped by the US Coast Guard.\nThere is little question that Haiti desperately needs economic assistance to get back on its feet. But if the US blindly doles out dollars it risks perpetuating a system that is doing nothing for its 6 million poor. Given the current situation, Haitians have little reason to feel optimistic that either their economic or political situation is likely to change in the near future.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T23:07:57Z","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/1989/1006/ekla.html"}

{"text":"Outside of the ocean floor, there are no empty spots on a map of Earth. At one time, of course, that was not the case. As little as a 150 years ago, most of the western United States and Canada's far north were vast white spaces on maps. It took centuries for explorers to answer the most basic questions about North America: What's there and where is it?\nDerek Hayes's \"America Discovered\" is a fascinating look at the evolution of North America as seen through the eyes of European explorers and mapmakers. He presents approximately 300 maps created over the past five centuries. It is a stunning collection that shows mapmaking not simply as the utilitarian necessity that it was, but also as an art form. In fact, given some of the flights of fancy that mapmakers indulged in when filling those empty spaces, some maps were more art than reality.\nHayes's commentary moves chronologically, beginning with the few maps we have from early Viking exploration of North America. He then moves on to Christopher Columbus, who technically didn't reach North America itself, but rather islands off the continent.\nAs Hayes illustrates, the next centuries saw a slow process to determine how big the continent was, how it might be traversed, and what resources could be exploited.\nAlthough many have a romantic view of these early explorers, Hayes makes it clear that nearly all exploration was driven by the profit motive. Explorers wanted to know what was over the next hill in hopes of being able to sell it back in Europe or somehow make money from settlers. \"Without that investment,\" he notes, \"little exploration would have occurred.\"\nStill, the maps often reflected desire more than reality. After explorers realized that North America wasn't Asia, they searched for a route to China. Rivers, bays, and straits not fully explored were reported back in Europe as paths across the continent. Those searching for riches placed nonexistent cities of gold and silver on their drawings.\nExploration dispelled some myths but propagated others, such as the belief that California was an island, a fantasy that persisted for nearly two centuries. Complicating matters was the fact that some nations hid their maps from the world, causing a few explorers to \"discover\" parts of North America repeatedly.\nAlthough maps are the stars of this book, Hayes's illuminating commentary is equally good. His training as a geographer and the four previous historical atlases he has edited have prepared him well.\nWhile he concentrates his chronicle on the better-known explorers and mapmakers, he doesn't ignore the unique stories of men unfamiliar to most of us, such as Arctic explorer John Franklin, mapmaker John Barnwell, and fur trader Peter Pond.\nBeautifully produced with large color reproductions, \"America Discovered\" traces the exploration of North America and what its explorers desired as the geography was gradually revealed. It's a wonderful introduction for those interested in learning how humanity filled in those mysterious white spaces.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T07:39:02Z","url":"https://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0125/p16s01-bogn.html"}
{"text":"Pep Guardiola believes his brilliant Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho can extend his Manchester City career by moving back to central defense on a permanent basis as he ages.\nHis versatility has also seen him look increasingly effective on occasion at center-half, a role he performed so effectively in last weekend's comfortable 3-1 win over Arsenal.\nNow Guardiola, who extended Javier Mascherano's career at Barcelona with a similar positional switch, reckons Fernandinho could benefit from the same move in England.\n\"I think he can play in that position, I am pretty sure,\" said City manager Guardiola ahead of Sunday's match at home to Chelsea, where a win for his side would likely see them leapfrog Liverpool into first place on goal difference, albeit having played one game more, after their title rivals 3-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\"He is fast, he is strong in the air, good going backwards and when he sees the football in front of him, his vision for the pass inside, switch of play is excellent,\" the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss explained.\n\"So he is intelligent to go forward or go backwards, so he understands everything. Of course he has to train more at it. I think he can do it, but his position is as a midfield player.\"\nGuardiola appeared to have gambled last week when he left England center-half John Stones on the bench and played Fernandinho in the heart of City's defense instead.\n\"I know what is going to happen, we are going to lose when Fernandinho plays in that position,\" he said. \"I am a genius, huh?\n\"But I discover a surprise for the opponents doing that and I know what is going to happen,\" the Spaniard added. \"‘Why do you take a risk and leave £45 million ($58 million, 51 million euros) on the bench when he can play in that position?’ And I know that.\"\nFernandinho's contract runs out next year, by which time he will be 35, which has focused Guardiola's attention on finding his successor, although the City boss admits that is not an easy process.\n\"We have some options and are looking for some options but today it is not easy to find the player and to buy the player so we will see. You know, we spoke many times about that. We are trying to help Fernandinho in that position.\"\nSince 2013, the reigning champions has finished an average 25 points behind the next season's winners and the last three defenses have been hugely unsuccessful.\n\"I know, in the last five or six years, the position where the champions were the year after,\" said Guardiola. \"All of them were out and didn't have a chance to win the Premier League.\n\"However, we are there. That is what I like the most in this season,\" he added.\n\"I say we are in the League Cup final and you are in all the competitions then we are fighting. In the last two seasons, Leicester and Chelsea had no chance, but we are there at the top.\n\"That is what I like the most but if we want to be there until the end.\n\"If we win against Chelsea it will help us and if we win the game, I am sure we will be there again fighting to be champions again.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-23T08:35:51Z","url":"http://m.naharnet.com/stories/en/256349-guardiola-urges-fernandinho-to-drop-back-for-a-future"}
{"text":"While watching the Stanley Cup match on Saturday, the first period ended and legendary sportscaster Bob Costas appeared on the screen with the Lexus Intermission Report.It made me chuckle seeing an overt corporate placement because the day before, a blogger at the political website Mother Jones named Tom Philpott had asked me on Twitter what I thought of a new EPA paper on the herbicide atrazine.\nWell, of course he should ask them, that is why I said it. The weird thing is that he believes it would be legitimate to ask anyone else. The reason is obvious, by way of an analogy; if you want to know about the weaknesses of an Intel processor, you go ask AMD, not Intel, and certainly not me. If there are flaws in the EPA's paper or gaps in the studies they selected for their analysis, the obvious way to find them is to ask is the manufacturer. That is Journalism 101.\nObviously, he did not want to engage in journalism, he wanted to engage in political posturing. But to what avail? Does he really think a small, unrestricted grant (.009 of American Council on Science and Health revenue last year) from a company allows them to buy some special clout with us? It's batty conspiracy talk. I wondered, watching that hockey game and that corporate-sponsored intermission report, if Mother Jones similarly believes Bob Costas is rigging the score of the hockey game to be whatever outcome Lexus wants. Because, you know, the network that pays him proudly lists Lexus right on the screen.\nAt the Council, we also proudly list our corporate donors, as does the American Heart Association, United Way and numerous prominent non-profits. You know who doesn't? Mother Jones. But they have them. A lot of them. On their last available Form 990, the Foundation for National Progress, the parent of Mother Jones, had ~$13,000,000 in revenue. A subscription to Mother Jones magazine costs $12. They have just under 167,000 subscribers.

{"text":"Jordan makes official statement: a Grad rocket hit Aqaba. The rocket appears to have been fired from outside Jordan.\nJordanian Minister of Information Nabil al-Sharif confirmed Thursday evening that a Grad rocket hit the city of Aqaba earlier in the day. Previously, Al-Sharif said only that an explosion had occurred in a warehouse in the city.\nAl-Sharif said the missile damaged a warehouse, and did not cause injury. The Grad was fired from outside Jordan, he said. Jordanian authorities plan to investigate the incident.\nIsrael is investigating the incident as well. Israeli investigators believe there may have been more than one rocket fired; additional rockets, if found, could give clues as to the identity of the attackers.\nTwo or three explosions were heard in Eilat on Thursday morning, leading to fears that rockets had hit the city. Security forces searched and found that the rockets had apparently struck Aqaba, adjacent to Eilat.\nOne theory was that the rockets had been fired by terrorists in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, who intended to hit Eilat but missed their mark. Egyptian officials denied that missiles had been fired from Egyptian territory.\nSome residents of Eilat expressed anger at the media for reporting that rockets had been fired at Eilat despite the fact that it has not been proven that Eilat was the target. Reports of terrorism targeting Eilat are premature, and are likely to harm the thriving tourist industry in the city, they said.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T10:35:47Z","url":"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/137164"}

{"text":"Gaza authorities shutter Al Arabiya and Maan offices in what critics call an illegal move.\nProtesting what they called Hamas' \"ongoing assault on journalists\", Palestinian journalists held a sit-in near Ramallah last week to protest against the Hamas government's recent closure of two media offices in Gaza.\nA week earlier, Hamas authorities in Gaza shut down two media offices used by Al Arabiya satellite channel and Maan News Agency, which they accused of \"disseminating false news and publishing fabricated reports\" about Hamas and its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.\nOn July 25, police officers arrived at the two media offices in Al-Rimal neighbourhood, west of Gaza City, and ordered their workers to leave immediately, saying they had an order issued by the attorney general to \"temporarily\" close the offices and seize their contents.\n\"Police detectives came to our office showing us an order issued by the attorney general to temporarily close our office, but they refused to give us a copy of the order,\" said Al Arabiya's Gaza office director, Islam Abd al-Kareem.\nHamas government spokesman Ehab el-Ghussein said the government had previously \"warned against going too far in fabricating news, spreading rumours, and publishing entirely baseless reports about the government, which served to disseminate hatred and incitement against the Palestinian people in Gaza\".\nWe're not biased, and in all cases this is Gaza's office, not Egypt's. If they tried to send a political message by closing our office in Gaza, it would be absolutely ludicrous.\nBut, he added, \"the two media offices ignored the government's calls and kept on with their unethical and unprofessional behaviour and policies, as they deliberately tried to implicate the government as interfering in Egypt's ongoing internal conflict\".\nHamas, which has been in control in Gaza since June 2007 and is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, has been repeatedly accused of interfering in internal Egyptian affairs.\nAl Jazeera recently reported that deposed Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi has been arrested on a number of charges, the most significant of which is his alleged conspiracy with Hamas to carry out \"anti-state acts\" including attacks on police stations, soldiers and prisons.\nGhussein emphasised that the government's policy is to not interfere in other states' internal affairs. The media outlets, according to Ghussein, \"falsely and deliberately\" portrayed the Hamas government as interfering in Egypt, thereby provoking resentment against it.\nMaan's editor-in-chief Nasser Al-Lahham criticised the decision to close the two offices, saying the move represents \"a continuation of Hamas government's crackdown on journalists and press freedoms\".\nSince coming to power, Hamas has restricted press freedoms in the Gaza Strip. These include an ongoing ban on importing three local newspapers printed in the West Bank, and a ban on Palestinian journalists from working, giving interviews or cooperating with Israeli press and television. Hamas has repeatedly stated it will not lift the ban on the three allegedly pro-Fatah newspapers until the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah lifts a similar ban it has enforced on pro-Hamas newspapers in the West Bank.\nLahham said Hamas' media office has \"consistently\" interfered with Maan's work over the past years, especially since the July toppling of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. \"Some Hamas officials in Gaza have apparently gone mad and started behaving irrationally after the recent events ended Morsi's and the Muslim Brotherhood's rule in Egypt,\" he commented.\nSimilarly, Al Arabiya's correspondent dismissed the government's claims of fabricating stories about the government and its relationship with Egypt as \"unfounded\".\nOn July 24, Maan News Agency published a news report citing an unnamed Israeli source and stating that \"six Muslim Brotherhood officials had smuggled themselves into Gaza to plan an uprising against the military in Cairo, after their Egyptian president was deposed\".\nWhen this later proved to be spurious, Maan responded that the story was originally published by an Israeli news site - which it has not named - and that Maan merely translated the report from Hebrew to Arabic, as per its policy.\nAlthough the government filed a complaint against Maan and Al Arabiya more than a month before this incident, Salama Marouf, the head of Hamas' media office, says the news report \"was the straw that broke the camel's back\".\nMarouf explained that the closure order was issued based on \"multiple pieces of damning evidence which the government supplied the attorney general with demonstrating unprofessional and unethical behaviour on their [the media outlets'] part.\n\"We found out their translation fabricated the original news report ... And they could have visited the Beach Hotel where they claim the Brotherhood officials were staying, and which is a few minutes away from their office, to factually confirm the news before they ran it on their site,\" he added.\nGovernment officials Ghussein and Marouf failed to provide specific complaints about Al Arabiya's coverage, though they vaguely stated that the majority of Palestinians in Gaza were \"offended\" by the Saudi-owned channel's coverage.\nAbd al-Kareem said he found it \"ludicrous\" to justify the closure of Al Arabiya's office by claiming it provides biased anti-Muslim Brotherhood coverage of the ongoing events in Egypt.\n\"We're not biased, and in all cases this is Gaza's office, not Egypt's. If they tried to send a political message by closing our office in Gaza, it would be absolutely ludicrous. And it would be telling that the order has come from a supposedly independent and unaffiliated party, i.e. the attorney general,\" he said.\nHuman rights groups in Gaza have condemned the office closures, saying the decision constituted a violation of press freedoms and freedom of expression, as well as of Palestinian basic law and international human rights standards.\nSamir Zaqout of the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights asserted that \"the closure procedures violate Palestinian Basic Amended Law of 2005, which denies any form of monitoring, ban or warning or the imposition of restrictions over the media unless by a judicial decision in conformity\".","timestamp":"2019-04-24T04:38:04Z","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/08/2013841318587276.html"}

{"text":"From the outlook of a planet that resides next to a quiet, relatively predictable star, the circumstances that lead to dramatic stellar explosions elsewhere in the universe can sound somewhat improbable. Some such blasts, known as type Ia supernovae, occur when a small, dense star known as a white dwarf—roughly the diameter of Earth, but hundreds of thousands of times more massive—grows too large by siphoning material off a neighboring star, igniting a thermonuclear explosion. Other cataclysms, known as type II supernovae, occur when much heftier stars, some of them dozens of times as massive as the sun, implode under their own weight.\nLuckily those circumstances arise infrequently enough to spare humankind the fallout of a nearby supernova. But the universe is a big place, and locally rare events such as type Ia and type II supernovae happen in relatively large numbers across the vast expanse of space. Now a sky survey has turned up a much rarer kind of supernova, one that defies the standard explanations for how such blasts work.\nFour new PTF supernovae, along with two events identified in the past several years that defied classification, all share the same unexplained traits: They are extraordinarily bright, and a spectral breakdown of their emitted light shows no trace of common supernova components such as hydrogen, iron and calcium. \"If you look at thousands of supernova spectra, as I do, these immediately jump out to you as being peculiar,\" Quimby says. \"They don't have the normal kinds of wiggles that you'd expect to see.\"\nThe extreme brightness of the new class of supernovae, some 10 times that of a typical type Ia supernova from an exploding white dwarf, rank them among the most luminous supernovae known. That luminosity enabled Quimby and his colleagues to spot a handful of the new supernovae among the 1,000-plus supernovae of all kinds that have been found by PTF, even though core-collapse supernovae appear to be 10,000 times more common.\nBut just what produces the brightness of the new class remains unknown. The way the supernovae fade from their peak brightness over time is inconsistent with the decay of radioactive elements, which is what powers the glow of a type Ia supernova. And in core-collapse cataclysms such as type II supernovae, heavy elements such as iron appear in the spectra, usually accompanied by hydrogen from the expanding supernova blast encountering ambient gas in the circumstellar medium.\nOne possible origin for the superluminous blasts is a very massive star, roughly 100 times the mass of the sun, that ejects a dense shell of hydrogen-depleted material. If it then undergoes core collapse to initiate a supernova, the supernova-driven ejecta would collide with the existing shell to glow brightly. Astronomers have found a precedent of a hydrogen-poor supernova preceded by an eruptive event, says Roger Chevalier, a professor of astronomy at the University of Virginia who did not contribute to the new research. But the scale of that eruption was far too small to explain the luminosity of the PTF group's supernovae.\nAlternately, a supernova could have left behind a magnetar, a highly magnetized form of the dense stellar remnants known as neutron stars. The rapid spin of a magnetar could provide an internal power source to light up the supernova ejecta. But that scenario is wanting for observational backup as well; all known magnetars spin far too slowly to account for the glow of the superluminous blasts. \"You want it to be formed with a spin rate of one to three milliseconds, and we don't have any evidence to show that magnetars form with those kinds of spin rates,\" Chevalier says. \"So in principle at least you can produce the high luminosity in that way, but again there's a lot we don't understand.\"\nQuimby and his colleagues are continuing to look for new events and to track fading supernovae over time to see how they evolve. They have even marshaled the Hubble Space Telescope to gather their ultraviolet spectra. \"By building that whole sequence and incorporating the UV data, we can get a better handle on the physical origins of these things,\" Quimby says. But for the moment neither mechanism for the newfound supernova class is entirely convincing, Chevalier notes. \"They both have their pluses and minuses, and I wouldn't say the community has come to an agreement about what is going on here,\" he says.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T22:43:12Z","url":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superluminous-supernova/?error=cookies_not_supported&code=82e3e5d1-4b3b-4642-b35e-42ae891600b3"}

{"text":"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A weightlifter who lost his family's house in a cyclone danced off stage at the Rio Olympics on Tuesday to raise awareness of the threat climate change poses to his remote Pacific nation.\nDavid Katoatau got more cheers than any other lifter, including a Brazilian, throughout the men's 105kg B Group.\nHis dances became a trademark of his victory in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland two years ago. That was the first gold medal in any global sporting event for his island nation of Kiribati.\nHe was also a social media sensation for his dancing as Kiribati's flag bearer at the Rio Games' opening ceremony.\nKiribati, located in the Central Pacific, is suffering \"extreme coastal erosion not just of the beaches but also of the land\" according to its government.\nSome scientists have predicted a catastrophic effect on Kiribati's 21 inhabited islands.\n\"Most people don't know where Kiribati is,\" Katoatau said. \"I want people to know more about us so I use weightlifting, and my dancing, to show the world.\n\"I wrote an open letter to the world last year to tell people about all the homes lost to rising sea levels. I don't know how many years it will be before it sinks.\"\nThat letter was distributed at a Commonwealth Games Federation meeting by Katoatau's coach, Paul Coffa.\n\"We don't have the resources to save ourselves,\" Katoatau said.\nKiribati also lacks the resources for basic sports facilities.\n\"There was no gym when I started training as a boy, and there is no gym now,\" said Katoatau, 32. \"I trained on the beach in the open sun. The bar would become too hot to touch so I had to train at six in the morning.\"\nKatoatau moved to the Oceania Weightlifting Institute when he was 16 and has been coached by Coffa since then. He now lives and trains at the Institute in Noumea, New Caledonia in the South Pacific.\nHe has a coaching certificate and intends to team up with Coffa when his lifting days are over. His next target, though, is defending his Commonwealth title in Gold Coast, Australia, in 2018.\nHe won a state reward of A$11,000 (S$11,340) for his Commonwealth gold and used it to build a home for his parents on Tarawa atoll, the most populated of Kiribati's more than 30 atolls and islands.\nThe house was destroyed in a cyclone soon after its construction, he said.\n\"We have built another one, but it's close to the sea so there is always a worry.\"\nKatoatau, who finished 15th in his 2008 Olympic debut, came in sixth in the B Group with 349kg, 1kg more than his Commonwealth Games effort.\nHe made his first five lifts but failed with the last one. He kissed the bar and danced off stage regardless, to the cheers of the crowd.\n\"I'll be dancing again tonight,\" he said.","timestamp":"2019-04-21T20:51:48Z","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/olympics-pacific-islander-dances-to-raise-climate-change-awareness"}

{"text":"Performance Reviews Are Pointless And Insulting -- So Why Do They Still Exist?\nI'm the HR Director for a growing manufacturing firm. I started the job in July. I report to the CEO.\nI'm putting my 2018 plan together. One thing I told my boss \"Jake\" when he interviewed me is that I plan to talk him out of the company's annual performance-review process.\nI agree with you that making every employee fill out an evaluation form and sit down to talk about it every year is a huge waste of time and energy, and most employees hate performance reviews.\nIf the relationship is healthy between the manager and the employee, they're having regular conversations anyway — including quarterly and annual planning sessions. If that isn't happening, I can help managers fix that -- but having more conversations doesn't require an evaluation process.\nI eliminated performance reviews at my last company and everyone was happy about it.\nOf course, employees need to be able to get feedback when they need it. If they can get that feedback without being graded like elementary school students then it's a win-win for everybody.\nJake says he might be open to the idea of abolishing performance reviews but he needs a very good reason to do so. In my last company I polled our managers (37 of them) and 35 were in favor of getting rid of performance reviews.\nThe other two managers were neutral. We knew the employees were negative about the performance review process because the subject came up regularly in our Town Hall Meetings and survey responses.\nJake wants me to write up a proposal for him. Thanks in advance for any insights you can share!\nPerformance reviews are artifacts left over from the Industrial Revolution.\nThey come from an earlier time, when work was designed on the mechanical model I call Godzilla.\nIf employees stand in front of a conveyor belt all day polishing widgets, you can easily count the widgets as they come down the line and see which employees are hitting their goals and which folks are missing them.\nKnowledge Work is is more complex and nuanced than that. Knowledge Worker jobs don't boil down to a number of widgets polished per hour or per quarter.\nSomebody on your team might have a breakthrough idea today precisely because they ignored the passing parade of widgets and stared off into space for 45 minutes.\nThat's the energy you want to inspire and capture in your company — not widget-polishing energy!\nPerformance reviews are not effective at improving performance. They have never shown their value as leadership tools -- but they make excellent power-and-control mechanisms, and that is one reason some companies have trouble giving up on them.\nIt doesn't help an employee move forward for a manager to tell them what they did well and did badly last year. If a manager needs to give someone feedback, they should do that in the moment — not months later.\nWhen we are lifted up in the service of a larger goal than to hit our weekly and quarterly numbers, we don't need to waste time rating and grading employees. We only need to reinforce them and give them room to run!\nWe need every millisecond of our time and energy to be spent inspiring and encouraging our teammates — not to mention moving obstacles out of their way.\n1. They take up expensive staff hours for no observable gain. It takes hours and hours of time for employees and managers to complete performance review forms, get them approved, set up performance review meetings and handle the paperwork. The next year, they do it all over again.\nWho benefits from that massive time and energy investment? Do your customers benefit? They don't — because if there were customer-benefiting information to be shared it would have happened whenever it came to light, not now.\n2. Their purpose is unclear — and always has been. Various people will tell you that performance reviews are essential for letting employees know how they're doing (why?), to justify pay increases (you don't need performance reviews for that), or to create a paper trail if someone should need to be terminated (doesn't work, because managers almost always give struggling employees average-to-good performance reviews. Later they say \"I was trying to motivate the employee!\").\nAnything you might want to accomplish through performance reviews can be accomplished without them.\n3. They are unfair. Companies come up with rigid systems (five-point review scales and ten-point scales!) but they never solve the biggest rating challenge — the fact that managers vary dramatically in their assessments of Excellent, Good, Average, Fair and Needs Improvement. Performance reviews are also unfair because they tend to weight more recent events and results more heavily than those from earlier in the year. They are unfair because managers have biases.\n4. Performance reviews are insulting. If I hire someone to work for me doing graphic design, marketing strategy or software development I can talk to them about the project and our relationship. I can let them know if I'm unhappy with something they do or don't do, but it's not my place to tell them how to do their job or how to live their life.\nPerformance reviews cement the bad, old idea that when someone is your supervisor, they sit on a higher plane than you do. That's ridiculous. A supervisor in today's Knowledge Economy is an orchestral conductor. The conductor keeps the orchestra together but doesn't presume to tell the musicians how to play their instruments.\n5. Every business process requires a clear objective and desired outcome, to pay its way in your busy operation. Performance reviews lack both a clear objective and a desired outcome. No one in your company can say \"Here's the outcome we want when we conduct performance reviews next year.\"\nThere is no desired outcome except to remind the employees who's a boss and who isn't — and to keep up a time-honored tradition simply because you've always done it.\nTalk to your fellow managers and employees and see what they think about performance reviews.\nIf you can't find anybody ready to defend performance reviews, tell Jake \"I didn't hear from anyone who wanted to keep performance reviews going.\n\"This is our opportunity to streamline our company, save money, act on our team members' feedback and shift our culture out of old-fashioned command and control management into new-millennium leadership!\"\nMost managers, like most employees, fear change.\nCEOs fear change, too. Tell Jake you'll use 2018 as a test year to see if your organization falls apart when you put the kibosh on performance reviews. I predict that like every other company that has done away with them, you'll be much happier when they're gone!","timestamp":"2019-04-26T07:55:20Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2018/01/14/performance-reviews-are-pointless-and-insulting-so-why-do-they-still-exist/"}

{"text":"Changed my mind. Let me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created. But I will never understand what is fierce, funny or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain. Reboots fair better when they honor the original as opposed to taking shots at the original. Reboots also do better when they listen to a still passionate fan base which is what it's all about, isn't it? That's why we do reboots. The fans are why we all get to do what we do. So we wish them well and hope for success.\nThe Charmed star's comment on Twitter regarding what is \"fierce, funny or feminist\" is likely a reference to the reboot's description, which used those adjectives when describing itself. It is one of the things Holly Marie Combs has spoken out on social media about before. In late January, she addressed it in a tweet referencing the new series \"feminist storyline.\" Many fans believe the original series also shared that characteristic.\nWhy The CW did not want to follows other networks and launch a revival of the original Charmed is anyone's guess. Fans of the original were clearly very open to the idea of continuing the story of \"the charmed ones.\" Charmed has accrued a passionate fan base in the twenty years since it premiered. The original series premiered in 1998 and ran for eight seasons before concluding in 2006. As of 2018, the series has been off the air for twelve years.\nThrough reruns and the entire series streaming on Netflix, it has been able to reach an even wider audience through the years. While television has been in the habit of bringing shows from the past back to life with a new cast and a similar storyline, it has also found tremendous success with ones that bring the original cast back for a new story. NBC and ABC have both experienced success using the latter formula for sitcoms and a drama should theoretically experience similar results.\nThe CW could have brought Charmed back and then done the reboot as a spinoff, maintaining both shows and expanding the franchise. The network gave the go-ahead for the reboot in January and this May, The CW picked up the series. The Charmed reboot will air after Supergirl on Sundays, as part of The CW's newly launched lineup for the night. The first trailer for the series has already been released, which led to a passionate response from fans. An exact premiere date for the reboot has not been announced yet.\nThe Charmed reboot will air Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on The CW, this fall.

{"text":"(Illinois News Network) -- A new Illinois law will soon allow schools to use recruitment agencies to find substitute teachers.\nThe program opens the door for school districts to work with temp agencies to supplement the search for substitute teachers for elementary and secondary schools. It will be available Jan. 1.\nMost school administrators will pull from the surrounding school districts to fill an open substitute teaching position, Ford said. But when that pool of teachers is tapped out, they are stuck. The new law will change that by allowing schools to pull from a larger group.\nRural schools especially are struggling to find teachers for “more technical areas” like sciences or foreign languages, said Ben Schwarm, the deputy executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards.\nA 2018 survey from the Illinois Board of Education showed nearly 3,000 unfilled positions – including administrators, educators, and other school personnel – across the state.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T00:54:57Z","url":"https://wqad.com/2018/12/20/new-law-will-allow-give-schools-more-options-for-substitute-teachers/"}
{"text":"You might want to start brushing up on your Iranian rap. Or Palestinian trance. Jordanian Punk will be important too. And don't forget Bahraini R&B. This is the music of the new revolution sweeping the Middle East. In Tahrir Square Egyptians rocked to a catchy number by rocker Mohammad Munir, who asked, \"How can I love you [Egypt] if you don't give that love back?\" If you want to know what the anthem of change in Yemen will be, check out mideastunes.com, where the region's revolutionary playlist is ready for download. This is no sugarcoated pop site. The music is about social change, human rights and freedom of expression, and it's manned (rather, womanned) by Esra'a Al Shafei, 24, a Bahraini activist whose social consciousness was raised not by western rock, but by the passioned rhymes of Kurdish Hip-Hop. \"My inspiration comes from music,\" says Shafei, who cut her activist teeth campaigning for the rights of Kurds at the age of 18. \"Sure, people like Gandhi give me hope, but what makes me want to go out and make change is people's stories, and that comes through their music.\"\nBut Mideasttunes is only a small part of Shafei's campaign for change. She also founded mideastyouth.com, a multi-media web platform that uses tweets, blogs, stories, links, videos and discussion forums to promote tolerance, human rights, freedom of speech and democracy not just in her native Bahrain, but around the Middle East. The site focuses on campaigns for the rights of migrant workers, persecuted religious groups, Kurds, and other minority issues. \"These are issues that are not limited to one country, they affect all of us in the Middle East,\" she says, in rapid-fire English. \"I wanted to use the pan-Arab movement to build relations between activists throughout the region.\"\nIt's working. The site has become the go-to place for young Arab activists. It's where people get ideas, and learn about new issues. And, most important, it's where they go for support. As a Bahraini, Shafei has to be cautious about pushing for change in her own country. At least two protesters were killed in an uprising that brought thousands to the capital's central square on Sunday and Tuesday. She has a family to protect, and, as she points out, \"If something happens to me, what happens to my work?\" Instead she helps activists in other countries, who in turn help her. It's like an online activism co-op. As an example, she is helping activists push for Kurdish rights in Syria, something she couldn't do if she were actually in Syria. \"It's a way for us to help each other out,\" she says. \"I tell people to practice caution if you live in those [repressive] countries, and focus on social rights activism elsewhere. It's a way to come together over the things we have in common  a desire for rights and freedoms.\"\nMideastyouth is about forging connections. It's also about producing content that raises awareness. The site produces cartoons and comics for distribution. A cartoon about the abuse of domestic workers, for example, or an engaging ad for Kurdish rights. The messages are clear, the production values high and the medium engaging. The result, she hopes, is getting people to think, and act. One promotional spot, a jazzy ad done in the style of a tourism commercial about the persecution of the Baha'i' minority in Egypt got thousands of hits within the first few days. \"People were talking about it because Muslims were doing it. Even the Baha'is were surprised,\" says Shafei, explaining that it was the first time a Muslim organization had been formed to fight specifically for Baha'i rights. To her, generating buzz is almost as important as getting the message across. \"This is what we do to get traditional media to talk about these issues,\" she says. \"And that is how you get the attention we really want.\" Of course the Internet is huge in the Middle East, she says. But your average Saudi isn't going to Google human rights. \"We can't wait for them to come to us. So we create new ways to find them.\" Once they connect, \"we can find more people wanting to work with the cause.\"\nShafei focuses on minority rights, she says, \"because we cannot have human rights for ourselves if the minorities in our countries don't either.\" Many rights-based organizations in the Middle East have traditionally been self-centered  for example, women supporting women. That kind of silo mentality is ultimately destructive, says Shafei. It keeps organizations isolated, and it also enables authoritarian regimes to play one group against another. \"As a Bahraini woman, yes, I would like my rights,\" she says. \"But in comparison to religious minorities or migrant workers, I have a lot more rights. I'm Muslim, Arab, a member of the mainstream that has more freedom of speech and a more comfortable life. We can't progress as a society if we leave the most vulnerable behind.\"\nThe hard work of overthrowing dictators, of course, is better left to locals. \"There are plenty of groups working on regime change, so we focus on the people who don't have a voice.\" That doesn't mean that she turns her back on calls for change  she pumps up the volume. She just launched crowdvoice.org, a user-powered service that tracks voices of protest from around the world through crowdsourcing. \"People can use it to collect or view collections of videos, photos, news stories, blogs, tweets and other media sources on current events,\" she says. \"It's used to amplify voices of dissent.\"\nShafei makes it very clear that her push for democracy and human rights has nothing to do with an American agenda for the Middle East. If anything, she says, the U.S. has demonstrated that its principal value in the region, at least, is self-interest. \"The United States continues to support repressive and anti-democratic regimes. The U.S. Government was aware of the injustices in Egypt, but continued supporting Mubarak because of self-interest. No one can argue that Saudi Arabia is the home of human rights or democracy, yet America continues to support the regime.\"\nThe credibility of the U.S. among the young in the Middle East, Shafei says, \"is in negative numbers.\" She says that neither she, nor other members of the Arab youth movement, are against Americans. When you see Arabs burning the flag, \"It's not Anti-American, it's anti-American foreign policy hypocrisy.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-19T06:43:07Z","url":"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2049406,00.html"}

{"text":"Tenders to redevelop Union Terrace Gardens will close in the middle of this month, it has been revealed.\nAberdeen City Council has still to appoint a contractor for the multi-million-pound revamp of the Victorian gardens and is accepting bids to carry out the work until later in the month.\nDouglas Lumsden, co-leader of the local authority, has not been able to give assurances the work – due to be completed in 2020 – will kick off this year, but has said it “hopes” to appoint a contractor by the end of the year.\nSNP group leader Stephen Flynn has raised concerns over perceived delays to the work.\nHe said: “We’re all well aware that Union Terrace Gardens is behind schedule and the key thing at this stage is the administration ensure their revised timetable is kept to.\nConstruction has yet to start, but without a spade yet hitting the ground it is feared it may be impossible for the ambitious project to be completed within the estimated 18- to 24-month timeframe.\nA number of high-profile council projects have been delayed in recent years, including revamps of Broad Street, the art gallery, Provost Skene’s House and the Central Library.\nLondon Olympic Park architects LDA Design won planning permission for its Union Terrace Gardens plan in March.\nThe proposals include new walkways, an amphitheatre and a cafe.\nThey aim to conserve the Victorian park’s heritage and to “sustain Aberdeen’s performance in times of economic difficulty”, according to a design statement.\nOther features of the scheme include a new accessible walkway route into the gardens from Union Street.\nLift access from Union Street into the upper level of the gardens will also be provided through a new entrance building on Union Terrace at the existing Burns Monument.\nThe central lawn space would be retained as a flexible space for large-scale gatherings and events and there would be a new entrance opposite His Majesty’s Theatre.\nThe plans mark the latest development in the future of the city park.

{"text":"There’s a familiar face in the Beaufort West mayor’s office. Above the wood-grained desk, a Vincent van Goghesque painting has been returned to the wall and his “Vuna municipality of the year” awards are back on the shelf. But the mayor is not reclining in the luxury chair.\nIt’s his deputy, the controversial Truman Prince.\n“Sometimes you have to lead from the back,” Prince tells the Mail & Guardian on Tuesday, explaining why he’s in the mayor’s office while the actual mayor — Noel Constable — occupies the deputy mayor’s quarters in the building next door.\n“People like to use this word, that I am controversial. But you know, controversial means most hated but also most loved,” he says.\nPrince returned to the driver’s seat of the municipality through Constable, the leader of the Karoo Democratic Force (KDF), who was elected mayor after breaking his coalition agreement with the Democratic Alliance and joining forces with the ANC.\nIn the 2016 local government elections, the KDF secured one seat in the local council and the DA and ANC won six each, making the new party the kingmaker.\nConstable sits in the much smaller deputy mayor’s office next door, preparing for a mayoral council meeting. “The meeting is meant to happen now but we can move it to 11.30am; I just have to check if it’s okay with Truman,” he says.\nTruman is in between taking meetings with disgruntled residents, some of whom have come to query municipal accounts.\n“If your door isn’t being trampled down, there is dysfunctionality in your office,” Prince explains with gusto, flattered by the hope residents have in his return to office and the number of people who visit him daily.\nPrince holds a master’s degree in public administration from the University of the Western Cape and was “born and bred” in Beaufort West. He describes himself as a grass-roots activist, connected to the most underprivileged communities.\nWhen there’s a funeral, he pitches up in his silver Mercedes-Benz to grieve with the family, says Oortman Okkers (55), a lifelong resident of Beaufort West.\n“He is one person who will never turn you away from his door. He got my son a job, and sometimes when we don’t have electricity or food we say: ‘Meneer, come and look at our food cupboards; they are empty.’ Then he will come with food hampers,” Okkers says.\nAlthough Prince styles himself as the people’s mayor — with his designer clothes, Italian leather shoes and a chicken-foot necklace around his neck — his chequered track record still haunts his tenure in government.\nBefore the 2016 local elections, he was reprimanded by the ANC for writing a letter to the council, asking that a construction tender be awarded to a company sympathetic to the governing party.\nAfter the polls, Prince literally shed tears: the results showed that the ANC would lose power to a coalition formed by the DA and the KDF.\nEntering the ranks of the opposition meant Prince would lose his mayor’s salary. A few months later, he also lost his position on the South African Football Association’s executive and its generous salary.\nSince returning to power after ousting DA mayor Japie van der Linde during a council meeting in February, Prince has again raised suspicions because of his management of municipal finances and a dubious toilet construction deal.\nA R1.9-million contract started in February to build 21 toilets connected to old council houses, most of which have an outside toilet in the corner of the yard, is the latest scandal hanging over his head.\nConstable admits the municipality spent all the money but not a single toilet has been finished. Instead, workers built two walls and installed the toilet pot, then dug a trench to lay piping towards the sewage point at the outside toilet — and left.\nThe piping was never connected, the trenches were left open and the toilet doors were never installed, rendering the lavatories useless.\n“I had to fill up this deep hole they just left in the back yard because it’s dangerous for the old people and kids,” beneficiary Alfred Louw explains outside his two-bedroom council house in Rusdene, opposite the Beaufort West football stadium.\n“They would start building a little bit here, then go next door to build a little bit, then come back and continue. Then in January, they left it like this. But if there’s just a hole in the fence of the stadium, it gets fixed now-now,” Louw says.\nConstable says the council budgeted R8-million for the project and intended to build 80 toilets costing about R30 000 each. The high cost is owed to a “labour-intensive approach”.\n“We said we could give the project to a big contractor to bring in machines and do it quickly, but our intention was to create jobs. So when you create jobs, you have to go with the labour-intensive approach. That’s why we are still waiting for the rest of the R8-million and that project will be completed,” he said.\nThen there’s the municipal accounts. When Van der Linde was ousted, he is said to have left the municipality with R2-million in its current account. In the five months since Prince and Constable have been in charge, the account has sunk into a R7-million overdraft, and Eskom and South African Revenue Service bills have not been settled.\n“The reason we are sitting with this problem … You see, Japie is a bit confused … He continued with a tender without having a letter of assurance from national treasury that they can roll over the money, and that put us in a very awkward financial position,” Prince says.\nOther residents, however, are not fooled by Prince’s charms. The town’s informal settlements have doubled in size over the past 10 years, residents say, and Prince has done very little to alleviate their suffering.\nThe N1 highway cuts through the town’s business district, bypassing B&Bs, colonial-era churches and the popular Chris Barnard Museum, and is usually packed with trucks and taxis making their final stopover before heading to Cape Town.\nIn Mandlenkosi, the worn-out streets are littered with rubbish and turn into dusty gravel roads passing by the asbestos council houses, where children compete with cattle and goat herders for space on the open fields to play football. Unemployed men and women sit in their front yards while others loiter in front of spaza shops owned by foreign nationals.\nBeaufort West has an unemployment rate of more than 60%, according to the latest figures from Statistics South Africa (2017). Many believe Prince has failed to deliver on his promises to bring about change.\n“We need to put food on the table and get jobs — we are not here to take pictures!” a young man in a KDF T-shirt exclaims angrily as Constable emerges from his office.\nHe is part of a large group of people who came to the office to inquire about when the toilet project, on which they earned R2 200 a month as temporary workers, would resume.\n“At the end of the day, he is just a politician. If you’re not his supporter, he won’t help you. And most people here don’t like to kiss people’s asses. We are really struggling,” says resident Angie Stuurman, who hopes to get her first job in two years.\nPrince supporters call him “Beaufort se baas” — someone who can tend to their immediate needs, usually by channelling government money into football projects.\n“I’m a soccer lover and I started football in the area ... If our sports structures are functional, then it will get the youngsters away from crime and drugs,” Prince says.\nPrince is not shy about Beaufort West’s heavy investment in football. The Fifa stadium cost R30‑million to build — R6.3-million was spent on astroturf alone — and this was money well spent, according to him. A former local football star, Prince now owns and partially manages the Beaufort West City football club.\nBut if Van der Linde and his DA colleagues have their way, Prince’s return to the deputy mayorship will be short-lived. Among the strategies being considered to remove him from office is a case opened against Prince for allegedly stealing water from the drought-stricken town.\nAfter his interview with the M&G, there’s a large group of people still waiting outside to see him. Prince speeds past them on his way to the mayoral committee meeting, infuriating them even more.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T06:25:41Z","url":"https://mg.co.za/article/2018-07-13-00-beaufort-se-baas-is-back-and-is-as-controversial-as-ever"}

{"text":"Tim Russert discusses his childhood, faith, the catholic church, religion mixing with politics, and a life of service with On Faith's Sally Quinn.\nTim Russert, the NBC commentator who revolutionized Sunday morning television and infused journalism with an unrelenting passion for politics, died of a heart attack yesterday.\nRussert was recording a \"Meet the Press\" introduction in an NBC sound booth in Northwest Washington when he collapsed and was taken by ambulance, accompanied by his longtime producer Betsy Fischer, to Sibley Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead soon afterward. He was 58.\nThe news swept the capital like a shock wave, with colleagues, rivals, President Bush and those vying to succeed him remembering Russert as a superb practitioner of political analysis and an irrepressible son of blue-collar Buffalo who, quite simply, loved the game. His influence was such that an appearance on the top-rated \"Meet the Press\" could boost or sink a candidate, and when he declared after midnight on May 6 that Barack Obama had wrapped up the Democratic nomination, that was treated as a news event in itself.\nRussert wore many hats -- onetime Democratic operative, Washington insider, NBC bureau chief, MSNBC commentator, sports fanatic, committed Roman Catholic, biographer of his father, dubbed \"Big Russ\" -- but his greatest legacy was his sustained style of interrogation. Grounded in prodigious research, Russert would press his guests on past statements and contradictions, often for a full hour, spawning legions of imitators.\nFriends were stunned by the news. \"I just loved him,\" said Bob Schieffer, host of CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"When I scooped old Tim, I felt like I'd hit a home run off the best pitcher in the league.\"\n\"He was made for Washington because he lived and breathed politics,\" said Judy Woodruff, a former NBC correspondent now with PBS. \"When our son was sick about 10 years ago, he was right there, calling, coming over, bringing him back gifts from trips.\"\nRussert's internist, Michael A. Newman, told MSNBC that an autopsy showed the journalist had an enlarged heart and that cholesterol plaque ruptured an artery, causing coronary thrombosis. He said Russert had been diagnosed earlier with coronary artery disease, but that it was controlled with medication and exercise and Russert had performed well on a stress test in late April.\nThe thread of Russert's career is laced through recent political history. His whiteboard from Election Night 2000 -- on which, early in the evening, he scribbled \"Florida, Florida, Florida\" -- became an iconic symbol of the disputed tally. Days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Vice President Cheney chose to appear on \"Meet the Press.\" In late 2006, Sen. Obama used the Russert program to say he was considering a White House run.\nRussert moved his father, a former sanitation worker, to a nursing facility last week and had escaped for a brief vacation in Italy with his wife, Vanity Fair writer Maureen Orth, and their son, Luke, before returning to Washington Thursday. Luke Russert, a radio sports commentator, had just graduated from college.\nFormer anchor Tom Brokaw gave MSNBC viewers the news at 3:40 p.m. \"He worked to the point of exhaustion so many weeks,\" Brokaw said, adding: \"This news division will not be the same without his strong, clear voice.\"\nWithin minutes, all the cable networks were airing nonstop remembrances of Russert, as if a head of state had died, and tributes poured in. Bush called him \"an institution,\" \"tough and hardworking,\" and \"as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it.\"\nObama told reporters he considered Russert \"not only a journalist but a friend. There wasn't a better interviewer on television, a more thoughtful analyst about politics. . . . I am grief-stricken with loss.\" Sen. John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee, called Russert \"the preeminent political journalist of his generation.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-20T18:00:15Z","url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/13/ST2008061302497.html"}

{"text":"Mikayla Minton pitched a pair of complete-game wins as the train that is McKinleyville High softball kept rolling Tuesday afternoon, picking up a pair of Big 5 Conference wins over visiting Fortuna, at McKinleyville High.\nMcKinleyville 10-run-ruled Fortuna in both games by scores of 13-2 (5) in game one and 15-5 (6) in game two.\nMinton, McKinleyville’s second pitcher behind McKenzie Gonsalves, got the start in both games and performed admirably in each. In game one the junior allowed two runs, none earned, on five hits and six strikeouts and in game two, five runs, one earned, on four hits and two strikeouts. Minton gave up just four walks on the day, two in each game, as she showed that her still-undefeated Panthers (9-0, 14-0) are not solely reliant upon Gonsalves and can get wins on days when she doesn’t take the circle.\nMcKenna Turner had an extremely proficient day at the plate for McKinleyville, going 6-for-8, including a 3-for-3 performance in game one, with a pair of RBIs on the afternoon.\nJaycee Morais went 2-for-4 with a trio of RBIs in game one and in game two, recorded another two hits for McKinleyville and scored three runs as well.\nAshley Ballew had a memorable game two for McKinleyville, batting 3-for-5 with three RBIs and a run scored.\nRenee Metz put together a quality opening-game performance for Fortuna, going 3-for-3 with a run scored while Paige Johnson and Lexi Roby each had a double in the loss. Morgan Murray and Roby both hit well in game two as each went 2-for-3 at the plate with an RBI.\nMcKinleyville will take a step back from conference play for the rest of the month before concluding its regular season with a 3-game series against Eureka (1-0, 7-2). Eureka, its season slowed by all-too-frequent cancellations due to rain, has yet to really break into its Big 5 schedule. It will need to win at least six of its next eight conference games before seeing McKinleyville at the end of the season if it wants to have a shot at passing the Panthers up in the Big 5 standings — otherwise, McKinleyville may have its first conference championship since 2011 locked up before it even plays its final conference series of the season.\nFortuna (0-6, 3-10) will look to snap its current eight-game losing streak today when it takes on Eureka.","timestamp":"2019-04-19T22:50:05Z","url":"https://www.times-standard.com/2019/04/10/minton-mack-beat-fortuna/"}

{"text":"Outnumbered on Fox News to feature four female hosts, one man. We’re gonna need a bigger glass desk.\nNew Fox News Show Outnumbered Will Have Four Female Hosts and One Man. Get It?\nKimberly Guilfoyle and Andrea Tantaros will host a new show on Fox News, in which they and two other women will gang up on one man.\nRoger Ailes is an evil genius. In the midst of a nationwide debate over whether Republicans are waging a war on women, Fox News is launching a new show called Outnumbered at the end of April. Outnumbered because the show will feature four female and one male host. The man will be “outnumbered,” meaning that even though Outnumbered is supposedly a female-centric show, the male point of view is still so central that it gives the show its title.\nReally, the word outnumbered should apply to the rest of Fox’s programming, where only 36 percent of anchors and correspondents are women. But you know, that’s the natural order of things. (Except on MSNBC and CNN, where women make up 48 percent and 58 percent, respectively, of anchors and correspondents.) Gender imbalance is only noteworthy when women outnumber men.\nStill, you have to hand it to Ailes for mastering the art of having it both ways. On the one hand, there’s no reason to think this show will be anything but excruciatingly sexist, starting with that condescending title that treats female anchors like a novelty. Mediaite reports that the show will feature Kimberly Guilfoyle and Andrea Tantaros, two women who have built careers out of reassuring cranky old misogynists that there are hot young women out there who agree with them.* On the other hand, the very setup of the show inoculates it against this accusation, since hey, Fox is giving women jobs on TV. It’s the same trick Republicans pull by putting female faces out front when pushing abortion restrictions or undermining equal-pay efforts.\nSo, will I tune in for Outnumbered? Absolutely, if only to see how the set designers create a desk that can show off four pairs of legs at once. Maybe, once given a show of their own, the second-tier ladies of Fox will start throwing their weight around like Megyn Kelly does. Kelly, who actually kicked Sean Hannity out of his time slot, has enough power to occasionally push back a little against the overwhelming tide of sexism spewing forth from her network. Then again, Kelly has a unique presence on the network, and she knows it, whereas many of the other women likely understand that someone else open to wearing 6-inch heels and shellacking on the makeup can probably replace them. For now, I’m just training for the Outnumbered drinking game: Every time the male host faux-complains about how disempowered he is around all these ladies, take a shot.\nCorrection, April 17, 2014: This post originally misspelled Mediaite.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T10:19:36Z","url":"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/04/outnumbered-on-fox-news-to-feature-four-female-hosts-one-man-were-gonna-need-a-bigger-glass-desk.html"}

{"text":"All Greater Farmington Founders Day Festival activities, except for the parade, will be held at Shiawassee Park in 2019.\nDennis Page is banking on bands, dinner specials and his famed ox roast sandwiches to help draw patrons to his restaurant during Greater Farmington Founders Day Festival, July 18-21.\nDrumming up business for Page’s Food & Spirits always has been a breeze during the event in previous years since it sits right downtown. But with nearly all of the festival action — from the beer tent to entertainment — moving to Shiawassee Park in 2019, Page is brainstorming ways to keep up momentum.\n“In the past years it’s been the busiest week of the year for my business,” said Page, from his seat at the bar on a recent afternoon. “People would come here to eat before going to the beer tent, after going to the beer tent. If you’re going to take it to the park it’s obviously not going to help businesses here if it’s a mile away in the park.\nPage, whose restaurant is located on Farmington Road approximately a half-mile to the park, is among business owners who oppose the decision to move the festival from downtown. The Greater Farmington Chamber of Commerce, which runs the festival, held children’s events and Fido Fest dog activities at Shiawassee Park last year, while maintaining musical entertainment and a beer tent in the parking lot at the Downtown Farmington Center on Grand River Avenue and Farmington Road. Art and crafts vendor booths were stationed on Farmington Road, south of State Street.\nNext year all but the parade on Grand River will be held in the park. A section of Shiawassee Road from Power to Farmington Road will be closed.\nFarmington City Council unanimously approved the Chamber’s special event application earlier this month.\nMary Martin, Chamber president, said the park is “logistically good” for a full festival, including entertainment and a beer tent. She told city officials that the children’s activities and canine events were successful last year and that sponsors were interested in concentrating all activities at one site, strengthening the festival’s exposure. She also noted that public safety costs would decrease with all activities in one place and parking would be freed up in the downtown shopping center. Farmington Road downtown also would remain open.\n“Certainly, the beer tent is a draw in the evening, but in the day people are looking for entertainment. People are looking for things to do, not necessarily to buy things,” she said, during a recent phone interview.\nAt Joe’s Headquarters on Farmington Road north of State Street, hairstylist Brandy Gregg voiced her support for moving the festival to Shiawassee Park. She said some of her clients cancelled appointments during the event when it was held downtown because they couldn’t find parking in the area.\nJoe and Kendra Mantey, owners of The Cheese Lady, located on the east side of the Downtown Farmington Center, said the festival neither helped nor hurt their business.\n“One the one hand you hopefully have some new people come in and that theoretically leads to more business later. But on the other hand there was no place to park. They used up an awful lot of the parking lot to hold the festival,” Joe Mantey said.\nKristy Libby has worked festival weekends at Farmington Center Florist, which is located on the west end of the shopping center. She said the event generated new customers for the store.\n“We get a lot of people coming in that didn’t know we were here,” she said,.\nGreg Cowley, a former DDA member, former councilman, and owner of John Cowley & Sons Irish Pub & Restaurant, criticized the move in a statement posted on the restaurant website. He wrote that holding the festival in Shiawassee Park would cost downtown businesses revenue and over time would downgrade the event.\n“My biggest objection is restaurants are going to pay the price for the moving of the beer tent to the park. They’ll fill the place with food trucks. All that revenue going to food trucks. That is not economic development,\" he said.\nHe accused the city council and Downtown Development Authority of abdicating their responsibility by allowing the Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with an events production company, to produce the festival.\nAccording to DDA Director Kate Knight, a nonprofit organization ran the festival before the DDA took it on in 2009, handing management to the Chamber in 2014. She said the event became “overwhelming” for her predecessor and DDA staff.\n“There are no downtown development authorities that run big events. That’s not the way it works any more. It’s not part of what DDAs do. Either you’re going to do economic development and downtown development, capital projects or you’re going to be a party planner,” she said.\nKnight said the festival is a perfect time for downtown businesses to create their own special activities, such as a sidewalk sale or party tent. Miller encourages restaurants to participate in the park or run shuttle buses from the park to downtown.\nMiller said the Chamber is in discussion with Our Lady of Sorrows and Farmington Public Schools for use of parking lots at the church and Farmington High School. Final plans will be announced closer to the event.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T04:08:28Z","url":"https://ux.hometownlife.com/story/entertainment/festivals/2018/12/27/farmington-founders-festival-away-downtown-gets-mixed-reviews/2374276002/"}

{"text":"Whether considering our highly educated workforce, robust payroll numbers, jobs, or employers, the 495/MetroWest region continues to offer a high return on investment for the commonwealth, employers, and residents; a vibrant and diverse employment base; and an excellent quality of life,\" the report concludes.\nBOSTON - Communities west of Boston and near Interstate 495 continue to enjoy commercial rents and home prices well below averages in the metropolitan Boston area despite steady population growth, according to a new report.\nThe 495/MetroWest Partnership's Economic and Commercial Real Estate Report, released Tuesday at the Statehouse, found an increasing gap in affordability between properties in Boston and those in the partnership's region. Lower costs, coupled with availability of real estate and below-average unemployment, indicate a strong economic climate in the MetroWest area, the report concluded.\nMunicipal officials, business executives and legislators from the region — which encompasses 35 communities along Interstate 495, as far north as Westford and as far south as Foxborough — gathered Tuesday for the group's annual advocacy day. Senate President Karen Spilka of Ashland, who delivered the keynote address, said the report reflects significant changes to an area that was once agrarian and spread out.\n\"So much has happened over these last 10 years to help make this region of the state — which I think is not only the best in the commonwealth but the best in the country — a truly wonderful place to live, work and raise a family,\" Spilka said.\nMean class A rents in the 495 belt were less than one-third the comparable rents in Boston in the fourth quarter of 2018, the largest disparity between the two metrics since at least 2010. Single-family homes are competitively priced, too: since 2008, the median price for a single-family home increased 23 percent in MetroWest and 92 percent in Boston and Cambridge.\nThe region continues to have hundreds of thousands of square feet available for businesses to lease at multiple locations, but job numbers appear strong in the report, too. MetroWest's unemployment rate of 2.6 percent is about half a percentage point lower than the statewide rate, and the lowest it has been since 2000.\n\"Whether considering our highly educated workforce, robust payroll numbers, jobs, or employers, the 495/MetroWest region continues to offer a high return on investment for the commonwealth, employers, and residents; a vibrant and diverse employment base; and an excellent quality of life,\" the report concludes.\nSpilka pointed to significant growth in recent decades. The region's population increased about 50 percent between 1970 and present day, and the total annual payroll jumped from $2.6 billion in 1980 to $24.5 billion in 2018, she said.\n\"The data shows the growing importance of the 495 and MetroWest region, from the $24.5 billion in regional payroll to the growth in commercial real estate and lab space,\" said Paul Matthews, executive director of the Westborough-based 495/MetroWest Partnership, in a brief phone interview with the Daily News.\nDespite the positive indicators, Spilka stressed in her remarks that the burgeoning region still faces numerous challenges, many of which are similar to those experienced across the state. Traffic can be suffocating. Affordable housing, even if better than Boston, is not as widely available as is needed.\n\"In MetroWest, we are clearly open to embracing and managing change, but our greatest challenge will be continuing to manage the growth,\" Spilka said. \"We must be really careful to continue to carefully steward our growth.\"\nShe outlined several priorities she hopes to see taken up in the Legislature to improve quality of life in MetroWest and elsewhere. Lawmakers need to find consensus on addressing climate change, lowering prescription drug costs, and improving mental health services, she said.\nThe Senate President voiced hope that this session would finally see education reforms enacted, almost four years after the Foundation Budget Review Commission outlined crucial gaps in the existing formula that leave schools underfunded by as much as $1 billion. She also echoed House Speaker Robert DeLeo's interest in considering various options to raise new transportation revenues.\n\"We know what the problems are. We know roughly what the price tag is. We know the longer we wait to fix, the higher the price tag goes up,\" Spilka said. \"Everything should be on the table.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-20T05:06:58Z","url":"https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20190410/report-touts-metrowests-healthy-economy-lower-housing-costs"}

But, chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, in an interview, revealed that the wicketkeeper-batsman has an angry side as well.\nSpeaking to Vikram Sathaye in the web series What The Duck, the left-arm spinner revealed an incident when Dhoni lost his cool with him in the middle of the match. Yadav, who attended the show with fellow spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, narrated the incident which took place during the second T20I between India and Sri Lanka in Indore in December 2017.\n“Wherever I pitched the ball, it went for six. The ground was so small. After every six, I would look at Mahi (Dhoni). He would say, ‘it wasn’t that far, you should keep it further’,” the 24-year old said.\n“After hearing this, Mahi bhai got angry and said, “Kya main pagal hoon yaha pe, mai 300 ODI khela hoon (You think I’m mad? I’ve played 300 ODIs)’,” he said.\nCoincidentally, Yadav managed to pick up the wicket soon after adjusting the field as per Dhoni’s instructions.

{"text":"Idealists like to say that money doesn’t decide elections, but the truth is, it usually does, said Don Dugi, a political scientist at Transylvania University in Lexington.\nThis isn’t news to Sellus Wilder, a Frankfort Democrat clobbered in this year’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary by millionaire Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who was much better-financed. Wilder is now managing Kemper’s 6th District House campaign.\nMoney allows a candidate to hire campaign staff to reach voters on a personal basis across a large area, and it lets her promote her ideas through broadcast and digital advertising and social media, he said.\n“And it’s the metric by which you’re deemed credible, or not, by everyone else — the news media, the party, other politicians, the donors. If you have some money, it’s easier to be taken seriously so that you can raise more money. But the reverse also is true if you don’t have very much,” Wilder said.\nFor all of the public debate over Congress — and its pitiful 13 percent job-approval rating as of last month — Kentuckians don’t show a great deal of interest in who speaks for them in the House of Representatives.\nOnly 44 percent of the state’s registered voters cast a ballot in a House race during the 2014 general election, when all six seats were contested, however weakly. Every incumbent was re-elected to another two-year term, including some, like Rogers and Ed Whitfield, R-Hopkinsville, who have spent decades in Washington.\nFew vigorous House races are expected anytime soon. For one thing, the two-party system has eroded. Faced with Kentucky’s status as a deeply conservative red state, Democrats essentially have surrendered the congressional delegation, said Tres Watson, spokesman for the Kentucky Republican Party.\nThe focus of the Kentucky Democratic Party on Nov. 8 will be preserving the narrow Democratic majority in the state House of Representatives, a crucial check on the power of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, said party spokesman Daniel Lowry. It’s not clear what help, if any, the party will be able to offer its congressional candidates who face an uphill climb, Lowry said.\nHowever, in 2014, the Kentucky Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington did not provide much assistance to Elisabeth Jensen, the Democrat challenging Barr that year. Barr outspent Jensen by $3-to-$1 and beat her by 20 points.\nOnce they are entrenched in Washington, congressmen enjoy a huge fundraising advantage that discourages most people from challenging them. Wealthy donors with an interest in favorable legislation and government spending line up to write them checks “because they’re a sure thing and a known quantity,” Dugi said.\nFor example, Barr, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, collects hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks, payday lenders, investment firms and other businesses affected by his work. Roughly two-thirds of Barr’s campaign money so far this election cycle comes from outside Kentucky, including more than $600,000 from lobbyist-rich Washington and its suburbs.\nRogers, first elected in 1980, enjoys even greater fundraising clout as chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which decides how the government spends its money. Rogers’ campaigns have raised nearly $11 million over the last 25 years, although he seldom faces much opposition in his Southeastern Kentucky district.\nVoters choose the names they recognize and feel good about, Dugi said.\n“When you’ve got someone like Hal Rogers, who has been there forever and who has brought so much pork back home … the chances of anyone coming in and beating him are slim to none.

Sunday night.\nJane Lynch became only the third woman to fly solo as host of the Emmys, serving with distinction as the MC of what was a mostly successful broadcast loaded with great bits, some potential drama that failed to heat up and, inevitably some low points. Here's a quick recap of the 2011 Emmys hits, misses and WTFs.\nShe was great. From her bit in the opening number when she discovered the joys of laugh tracks to her \"gay agenda\"—involving calling Rachel Maddow and changing her oil--to her skit as Donatella the Jersey housewife behind \"The Jersey Shore\" and 113 other TV shows, Lynch's jokes were tight and her timing was on point. But having the show's host be a nominee in the show's first category felt really awkward. Not her fault, but someone should've said something.\nBaldwin had a joke about the News Corp phone hacking scandal cut from his opening bit. Baldwin asked that the bit be cut, allegedly not over it being censored, but because he felt the bit didn’t flow without the line. So Fox reshot the bit with Leonard Nimoy in his stead. With the knowledge that the bit had been edited and then lost Baldwin, there was no hope that it would work, and it didn't—fortunately, it was short and merely an intro to Lynch's opening number. It turned out to be a classic case of not being able to enjoy the sausage once you knew how it was made—kinda wish Baldwin hadn’t given a play-by-lay via Twitter.\nIn a year when women seemed to have made a great leap forward in the world of comedy, with films like \"Bad Teacher\" and \"Bridesmaids\" letting the ladyfolk take the lead, to see Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Edie Falco, Laura Linney, Martha Plimpton and eventual winner Melissa McCarthy brought up on stage for a faux beauty pageant was gross, and made grosser still when McCarthy was handed a tiara and a bouquet of roses. Watching it, we were hoping against hope that it was a set-up for making the men go through the same shtick, but alas… And then there was a bizarre echo to the moment when McCarthy and Poehler came out to present Best Actor in a Miniseries or Movie, making jokes about how men had to show a little skin to keep audiences interested.\nThroughout the evening the action was thrown to a chorus comprised of Joel McHale, Wilmer Valderama, Zach Levi, Cobie Smulders, Tajari P. Henson and Kate Flannery singing introductions to different segments of the show. It was forced, incomprehensible and pointless, serving only to slow down the action. The highlight from the chorus was Zach picking his nose and trying to wipe it on Wilmer's coat, or maybe LL Cool J's cameo.\nA mini-episode of the acclaimed show featured guest stars like Kim Kardashian (\"'Work'? Am I pronouncing that right?\") and \"Breaking Bad\" star Aaron Paul as Creed's meth dealer was hilarious and topped of with the perfect ending, as Ed Helms went in to confront the new boss, Ashton Kutcher, suggesting that maybe he was in the wrong place. It was our first look at the newly minted \"Two and a Half Men\" star in action, and he nailed it.\nThe rap trio Lonely Island (\"Saturday Night Live's\" Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone, and Andy Samberg) sort of popped up out of nowhere, with Michael Bolton, Akon, Maya Rudolph and Bill Macy in tow. We're not sure what they were doing there, but they crushed it.\nThe will-he/won’t-he drama surrounding Sheen's rumored appearance made for some good gossip, but when the moment finally came, he was almost disappointingly gracious, wishing his former \"Two and a Half Men\" colleagues the best of luck. It was a bit of a letdown after all the shenanigans Sheen has perpetrated this past year, but it was the right thing to do.\nWhy were the comedy awards handed out, and then the reality and variety awards followed by the drama prizes? Awards bodies have dissed comedy forever, why implicitly enforce the impression that they're something lesser? Especially on a night when a sitcom, \"Modern Family,\" won more awards than any other show. And any time you structure a show that invites viewers to tune out for 10, 20 or 30 minutes, you've done something wrong.\nAny awards show that ends a minute early automatically scores at least a 6, and this show was decidedly stronger than that even.","timestamp":"2019-04-26T00:32:08Z","url":"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/celebrity/2011-Emmys-Show-Delivers-More-Highs-Than-Lows-130096078.html"}
{"text":"I find it interesting that history has made it necessary for governments to bind their mouths shut during an election so as not to influence the course of the election while the politicians themselves make all sorts of promises.\nWhat it does is stop the politicians from making use of public servants to help with their campaigns – once the writ has been dropped. Of course up until that moment, they can do just about whatever they want that looks like something the government might have done anyway – announce grants mostly.\nMy mother always told me to disbelieve 99% of what I heard and a percentage of what I saw with my own eyes as well. Doesn’t that just give you a warm fuzzy feeling about how much trust there is in the world?\nWith all due respect to our MLA, Premier and all those other people out there, I find it difficult to believe anything I hear at all. Reminds me of the old, old, old joke – How can you tell when a politician isn’t lying? His (or her) lips aren’t moving.\nIt’s enough to make me wish there was a law to force politicians to live up to their campaign promises even if they had to pay for it out of their own pockets. Of course, that would make it difficult when they found that the tax cuts they promised were shown to NOT have the effect desired on the economy or on the actions of industry. Industry mostly does what will help it make more money, though some are more risk averse than others, and thus less likely to try something new because they don’t know how well it might work.\nI would try and keep quiet myself and not support either side, but then I might not be doing my job, which is sometimes to express an opinion, but only sometimes and when I do I’m supposed to make it clear that it is only my opinion.\nSo here is my opinion. The government that is in place is the one that I prefer. They have managed to put more money into the educational system and into the healthcare system, both of which I care about deeply. The previous government did a good job of talking about being fiscally responsible but, in my mind, failed to think far enough ahead into the future. Education is important. It’s not just a way of keeping kids off the street until they are old enough to find a job. The better the education system works, the better our economy will work because the people going into the economy as employees, employers, business people will have a better understanding of how to make life better for themselves and their families without making other peoples’ families suffer.\nI don’t believe this has anything to do with any political agenda – in my opinion. People will vote the way they believe will do the most good – for themselves.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T16:02:53Z","url":"https://www.fairviewpost.com/opinion/editorials/thinking-election-decisions"}

{"text":"MARTIN O’NEILL has dismissed any suggestion he does not have the fight to guide Sunderland out of the relegation zone, insisting there is still plenty of fire in his belly.\nO’Neill is involved in his first relegation scrap at any level since becoming a manager at non-League Grantham Town in 1987.\nIt is uncharted territory for the Ulsterman, who has enjoyed almost three decades of success in a management career that has also taken him to Wycombe, Leicester, Celtic and Aston Villa.\nBut he now finds his team deep in the mire following a run of seven games without a win, and with Manchester United the next visitors to the Stadium of Light tomorrow.\nThe 61-year-old has been criticised in recent weeks by Sunderland fans, who have suggested his famed leadership powers may be dwindling.\nBut yesterday O’Neill dismissed any notion that he is on the wane having met supporters at a fans’ forum on Wednesday night.\n“Am I still as determined and enthused about the game? I don’t think I analyse this every day but you have to have enthusiasm for the game otherwise don’t do it,” he said.\n“If you ask Sir Alex Ferguson what keeps him going at the age he is – obviously going in to work with a brilliant team does help – but it is that incredible enthusiasm he has .\n“You can talk about determination and everything else, but they are secondary to enthusiasm.\n“I am what I am. If you are expecting me to step into a press conference after performing in the manner we did against Norwich two weeks ago and be jocular, then you would tell me I needed my head examined.\n“As a player, I always concerned myself with losing matches, same as a manager. I don’t know who is saying I am downbeat. That’s their opinion but I heard some people saying our performance against Norwich wasn’t a Martin O’Neill team.\nRemaining upbeat is part of my nature.\nSunderland supporters are certainly not seeing the funny side at the moment as their team spiral towards the drop zone having won just three points from a possible 21, leaving them just four ahead of third-from-bottom Wigan.\nWith skipper Lee Cattermole and top-scorer Steven Fletcher sidelined for the rest of the season, these are testing times for O’Neill, who has never been involved in such a desperate struggle before.\n“No, I can’t remember one, certainly not in recent times,” he said.\n“Last season, I came here with more games to play with, as the team had only played 14 matches and had dropped into the bottom three.\n“You always felt you could get something going and we could pull out of trouble – and we did.\n“There are tough games ahead but exciting ones to be involved in and we’ve got to get on with it.\n“The injuries to Fletcher and Cattermole are a blow to us but that’s the nature of the game. I didn’t expect to get through all of the international matches unscathed but it is now about opportunities for other people.\nWithout a home league win over Manchester United since 1997 and shorn of their two best players, this is probably not the ideal time to be playing the champions-in-waiting.\nSunderland need O’Neill’s infectious enthusiasm and managerial pedigree to guide the club to safety now more than ever, otherwise their six-year stay in the top flight could come to an abrupt end on May 19 at White Hart Lane.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T22:34:20Z","url":"https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/387811/Martin-O-Neill-won-t-let-it-all-go-belly-up"}
{"text":"LinkedIn has responded to criticism of its \"social ads\" feature over its use of members' names and photos in advertisements on its website.\nMany LinkedIn members have complained that the use of their details in this way constitutes a violation of privacy, particularly as they have to opt out of the feature rather than opt in.\nRyan Roslansky, director of product marketing at the professional networking site has conceded in a blog post that LinkedIn could have communicated its intentions around social ads more clearly.\nWhile pointing out that members were notified via the official blog and banner ads on the site as early as June, he said the company had since learned that although members are happy to have their actions, such as recommendations, visible to their network as a public action, some of those same members may not be comfortable with the use of their names and photos associated with those actions used in ads served to their network.\nRoslansky has promised that LinkedIn will be changing the look of social advertisements so that names and photos of members are not included. Instead, the ads will in future include a link to others in a users' network who follow the advertiser on LinkedIn.\nHowever, the professional networking site has stopped short of switching to an opt-in approach, as Paul Ducklin, head of technology, Asia Pacific at security firm Sophos pointed out. \"The company still seems happy with opt-out, though I must admit that it has made opting out of social ads fairly straightforward,\" he said in a blog post.\nA better business standard would be to make this sort of new feature opt-in, he added. \"Short-term sales goals might be easier to achieve with opt-out, but we know that opt-in would be safer for users,\" Ducklin wrote.\nHe said users with strong opinions about privacy would become strong advocates for a service provider which set this sort of standard, and that privacy regulators would also be impressed.\n\"So we feel sure that adopting an opt-in model would actually be better for a service provider's business value in the long term,\" he said.\nDucklin has called on all LinkedIn members to send e-mails encouraging the firm to take the lead on privacy by locking everything down by default and enabling it only if users specifically opt in.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T08:30:28Z","url":"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240105335/LinkedIn-bows-to-pressure-over-social-ads-privacy-concerns"}

{"text":"(CNN) – The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for the first time on treating children with concussions, saying they will provide doctors with the “tools they need to ensure the best outcomes for their young patients” with mild traumatic brain injury.\nMore than 800,000 children seek treatment for traumatic brain injury every year, according to Dr. Debra Houry, director of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. The issue has become more pressing as youth sports have grown in popularity and because research has shown that repeated blows to the head, such as from playing football or heading a soccer ball, can lead to long-term memory loss, dementia and other serious health issues.\nThe CDC said its guidelines were based on the “most comprehensive review of the science” over the past 25 years related concussions, which doctors and researchers refer to as mild traumatic brain injury, or mTBI.\nDo not routinely image pediatric patients to diagnose a mild traumatic brain injury.\nUse validated, age-appropriate symptom scales to diagnose a concussion.\nAssess for risk factors for prolonged recovery, including history of concussions or other brain injury, severe symptom presentation immediately after the injury, and personal characteristics and family history.\nProvide patients and their parents/caregivers with instructions on returning to activity customized to their symptoms.\nCounsel patients and their parents/caregivers to return gradually to non-sports activities after no more than two to three days of rest.\nThe CDC published the guidelines Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics.\nIn an accompanying editorial, Michael McCrea, a professor of neurosurgery and neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and Dr. Geoff Manley, vice chairman of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, praised the CDC for issuing the guidelines, saying that “clinicians have been hampered for years by the lack of an evidence base to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and management” of youth concussions.\n“We applaud the CDC guideline’s recommendation for clinicians to counsel children and their parents as to the known acute effects of injury, expected course of recovery, and factors that may positively or negatively affect recovery and outcome after mTBI,” McCrea and Manley wrote.","timestamp":"2019-04-25T22:00:55Z","url":"https://kfor.com/2018/09/04/cdc-issues-first-guidelines-to-treat-youth-concussions/"}
{"text":"Samsung Electronics reported its lowest annual profit since 2011 during its earnings call today as its smartphone sales continue to suffer from increasing competition. In 2014, the company’s profit was 25 trillion won, a 32 percent drop from a high of 36.8 trillion won in 2013.\nIts 4Q2014 net profit fell 27 percent to 5.3 trillion won year-over-year, in-line with Samsung’s earning guidance earlier this month.\nThe Korean tech giant reported that its mobile unit’s earnings dropped 64 percent year-over-year to 1.96 trillion won, marketing its fifth quarterly decline in a row. Mobile sales accounted for just 58 percent of Samsung’s total operating profit last year, a significant decrease from 70 percent in 2013. The company said smartphone shipments fell in 4Q2014 and will continue to decline this quarter.\nSamsung’s semiconductor business helped buoy up its profits, even though it didn’t make up for shortfalls in its mobile unit’s performance. The unit posted 4Q2014 operating profit of 5.3 trillion won and said its performance will continue to improve as more smartphone and tablet manufacturers order chips from Samsung, especially for high-end devices.\nThe performance of Samsung’s mobile unit stands in contrast to its arch-rival Apple, which yesterday reported that it had sold a record-breaking 74.5 million iPhones during the first quarter of its fiscal 2015 year. Apple gained ground thanks to the popularity of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, especially in China, where it competes with Samsung as well as domestic smartphone makers like Xiaomi and Lenovo.\nIn fact, research firm Canalys reported that Apple topped smartphone shipments in China for the first time last quarter. This means that Samsung is now in third place, behind Apple and Xiaomi.\nDuring the earnings call, Robert M. Yi, the senior vice president of Samsung Electronic’s investor relations, said that he expected “the business environment in 2015 to be as challenging as in 2014,” due to economic recession as well as intensifying product and price competition and the increasing cost of developing new technologies.","timestamp":"2019-04-24T19:59:59Z","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/samsung-reports-lowest-annual-profit-in-three-years-due-to-lagging-smartphone-sales/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Techcrunch+(TechCrunch)"}

It’s near Mariemont’s community swimming pool at 6000 Mariemont Ave. in Dogwood Park, which is at 3721 Pleasant St.\nThe site’s name is a nod to Madisonville archaeologist Charles Metz, who worked at The Madisonville Site at the turn of the 20th century.\nThe Wynema Village Site is south of 6000 Mariemont Ave. in the South 80 Gardens and Walking Trails Park, which adjoins Dogwood Park.\n“The new Mariemont Native American Cultural Center will include artifacts from the Madisonville Site, including those obtained from the late Dr. Charles Louis Metz who is responsible for the site’s scientific discovery and excavation as well as the involvement of Harvard University,” said Ken Tankersley, associate professor of anthropology and geology and curator of the Court Archaeological Research Facility – all at the University of Cincinnati.\n“The cultural center will also include artifacts excavated by the University of Cincinnati from the recently discovered historic contact period Wynema Village Site located in the (South 80 Gardens and Walking Trails Park),” Tankersley said.\nArtifacts will include, pottery, flaked-stone tools and weapons, plant and animal remains and European trade goods. “Additionally, items that were owned and used by Dr. Metz during his excavations in Mariemont will also be on display,” Tankersley said.\nThe Madisonville Site is the largest and most thoroughly studied village of the late Fort Ancient culture (A.D. 1450 to 1670), according to the website of the Ohio History Connection, a nonprofit organization formerly known as the Ohio Historical Society.\n“Artifacts were so abundant here that local residents called this site the ‘pottery field’,” the website says.\nPolicastro said it has long been a dream of his to open a Native American cultural center in Mariemont without having to ask residents to approve a tax specifically for the center.\n‘“I have been working on this project for about 10-plus years, trying to find sources of funding for the building,” Policastro said.\nThe mayor said the village has won a $400,000 matching-funds state grant to build the addition.\nHe credited Tankersley, state Rep. Tom Brinkman, R-Mount Lookout, and architects Dennis Malone, of Anderson Township, and Bob Rich, of Fairfax, with helping to make that happen.\n“For a municipality to be able to fund this type of building addition without having to raise taxes is unheard of, but we did it,” Policastro said.\nTankersley, who has been documenting archaeological sites in Mariemont since the early 1970s, will serve as curator of the Mariemont Native American Cultural Center.\n“Unlike other culture centers, which use casts and replicas, the new Mariemont Native American Cultural Center will have on display the actual artifacts from Mariemont’s rich historic past,” Tankersley said.\nWant to know more about what is happening in Mariemont?

These mandates would include nonprofits as well as religious organizations. The bishop states such action would be against the church's teaching citing freedom of religion and freedom of conscience.\nThis same bishop had no problem suspending religious conscience when in 2008 he told his congregations that you can be pro-life and still vote for a pro-abortion president because \"as Catholics, we are not single issue voters.\" This convoluted reasoning was in part responsible for a majority of Catholics voting for Obama.

{"text":"The US has to stand up to China's abusive trade practices like intellectual property theft. And we won't leave farmers to face Chinese bullying alone.\nIn 2011, a group of Chinese nationals dug up genetically engineered seeds from an Iowa corn field and planned to steal and send them back to China, so they could be reverse engineered. Those seeds, the result of years of research and millions of dollars of American investment, now stand as one of countless pieces of evidence in the case against China for intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\nNow, President Donald Trump is standing up to China, which wrongly believes it can bully our farmers to get America to back away from defending our national interests. The president understands that our farmers feed, fuel and clothe this nation and the world, and he will not allow U.S. agriculture to bear the brunt of China’s retaliatory tactics.\nAmerican producers have benefited from the policies of the Trump administration, including historic tax reforms and reduced regulations. And farmers know that 20 cents of every dollar of their income relies on trade, which is why they are watching the situation with China closely. The simple truth is that when trading partners break the rules, there must be consequences.\nTo stop China’s predatory attacks on America’s innovation base, President Trump is instituting a program of tariffs and is considering investment restrictions and strengthened export controls. These tariffs will help pressure the Chinese to stop engaging in unfair practices and fully open up its markets to U.S. products, including U.S. technologies. The correct response from China would be to stop stealing from Americans and give American products a level playing field to compete in China, not to retaliate and reinforce its own position.\nMore: Donald Trump promised a trade war. Should we let his voters get what they asked for?\nThere is no denying that the disruption in trade relations with China is unsettling to many in agriculture, but if the president succeeds in changing China’s behavior, America’s farmers will reap the benefits.\nIn the meantime, the president has instructed me to craft a strategy to support our farmers in the face of retaliatory tariffs. At the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we have tools at our disposal to support farmers faced with losses that might occur due to downturns in commodities markets. To this point, we have not unveiled our strategy, as it is not good practice to open our playbook while the opposing team is watching.\nBut farmers should know this: They have stood with President Trump and his policies, and we will make good on our promise to stand with them as well. If China does not soon mend its ways, we will quickly begin fulfilling our promise to support producers, who have become casualties of these disputes.\nWithout question, there is much at stake for this nation in trade disagreements. A bullying and predatory China has made no secret of the fact that it seeks to acquire America’s technological crown jewels by any means necessary — through physical and cybertheft, forced technology transfer, evasion of our export controls, and state-directed and -funded investment in sensitive technology. And while it may seem outrageous, China has rejected American genetically engineered products, while sending agents crawling in corn fields to pilfer samples of our technology and even purchasing a company that provides U.S. farmers with key genetically engineered seeds.\nPresident Trump has said correctly that if China captures the industries of tomorrow, America will not have an economic future to look forward to — and our national security will be severely compromised. Cutting-edge technologies — from artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and biotechnology to aerospace, high-tech shipping and robotics — are critical to our defense. We are faced with a decision: Will others determine our destiny, or will we control our own future?\nChina began raiding our economy long before a team of thieves infiltrated that Iowa corn field, but President Trump aims to stop the larceny now. The president is a tough negotiator, and I am confident that American agriculture will flourish because of trade relationships that are smarter, stronger and better than before. China might underestimate the strength and resolve of American farmers, but the president does not. And he will not allow our agricultural producers to suffer because of China’s continued bad actions.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T09:01:38Z","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/06/25/donald-trump-china-tariff-retaliation-intellectual-property-agriculture-farm-perdue-column/725447002/"}

{"text":"ANKARA (AFP) - Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Argentina next week, a spokesman said on Thursday (Nov 22), amid tensions over journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\nSuch a meeting would be the first face-to-face encounter between Erdogan and the crown prince since the grisly killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month, which has tainted the image of the kingdom's de facto ruler.\n\"There could be\" a meeting, Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said.\n\"We're looking at the programme,\" Kalin said, according to state news agency Anadolu.\nSeeking to rally support from Arab allies ahead of the summit, Prince Mohammed on Thursday embarked on a regional tour starting with the United Arab Emirates, his first official trip abroad since Khashoggi's murder tipped the kingdom into crisis.\nThe former court insider and Washington Post contributor was killed and dismembered in what Saudi Arabia said was a \"rogue\" operation, but CIA analysis leaked to the US media pointed the finger at Prince Mohammed.\nSaudi Arabia has said that 21 people are in custody, with death penalties sought against five men, but attention remains focused on whether the crown prince ordered the murder despite the kingdom's denials.\nThe European Union on Thursday called for those \"really responsible\" to be held to account.\nCalling for a \"completely transparent and credible investigation\", the EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini said: \"For us accountability does not mean revenge.\"\nErdogan has said the order to murder Khashoggi came from \"the highest levels\" of the Saudi government but has stopped short of directly blaming Prince Mohammed.\nErdogan and the crown prince spoke for the first time on the phone on Oct 24 about the case, discussing the joint efforts needed to shed light on the murder.\nBut Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has criticised Saudi officials over their lack of cooperation.\nUS President Donald Trump on Tuesday glossed over the CIA's reported conclusion that the crown prince had authorised the killing, saying Washington would not slacken its support for the kingdom.\nTrump has admitted that the prince may have been behind the murder.\nPrince Mohammed, meanwhile, set off on a visit to a \"number of brotherly\" Arab states at the request of his father, King Salman, the royal court said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, without naming the countries.\nAbu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed welcomed him on his first stop in the UAE, a close ally that is part of a Saudi-led coalition battling Iran-aligned Huthi rebels in Yemen, according to the Emirati state news agency WAM.\nThe prince is also set to travel to the Tunisian capital on Tuesday, a presidential source in Tunis told AFP.\n\"It's hard not to see this regional tour as a victory lap\" after winning Trump's support, said Kristin Diwan, of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.\n\"Travelling to friendly countries effectively compels them to demonstrate their support for the crown prince, and rallies regional support ahead of the G-20,\" Diwan told AFP.\nThe Saudi prosecutor last week absolved the crown prince of blame for the murder of Khashoggi, a US resident since 2017 who had written critical articles and once compared Prince Mohammed to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nA spokesman for the Saudi public prosecutor said Khashoggi was drugged and his body dismembered, but Turkish officials say he was strangled. The whereabouts of the body remain unknown.\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Wednesday said criticism of the crown prince is a \"red line\", and that calls for him to be held accountable for the murder would not be tolerated.\n\"In Saudi Arabia our leadership is a red line.

{"text":"UCLA researchers and colleagues have designed a new device that creates electricity from falling snow. The first of its kind, this device is inexpensive, small, thin and flexible like a sheet of plastic.\nThe researchers call it a snow-based triboelectric nanogenerator, or snow TENG. A triboelectric nanogenerator, which generates charge through static electricity, produces energy from the exchange of electrons.\nFindings about the device are published in the journal Nano Energy.\nSnow is positively charged and gives up electrons. Silicone — a synthetic rubber-like material that is composed of silicon atoms and oxygen atoms, combined with carbon, hydrogen and other elements — is negatively charged. When falling snow contacts the surface of silicone, that produces a charge that the device captures, creating electricity.\n“Snow is already charged, so we thought, why not bring another material with the opposite charge and extract the charge to create electricity?” said co-author Maher El-Kady, a UCLA assistant researcher of chemistry and biochemistry.\nAbout 30 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by snow each winter, during which time solar panels often fail to operate, El-Kady noted. The accumulation of snow reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches the solar array, limiting the panels’ power output and rendering them less effective. The new device could be integrated into solar panels to provide a continuous power supply when it snows, he said.\nThe device can be used for monitoring winter sports, such as skiing, to more precisely assess and improve an athlete’s performance when running, walking or jumping, Kaner said. It also has the potential for identifying the main movement patterns used in cross-country skiing, which cannot be detected with a smart watch.\nIt could usher in a new generation of self-powered wearable devices for tracking athletes and their performances.\nIt can also send signals, indicating whether a person is moving. It can tell when a person is walking, running, jumping or marching.\nThe research team used 3-D printing to design the device, which has a layer of silicone and an electrode to capture the charge. The team believes the device could be produced at low cost given “the ease of fabrication and the availability of silicone,” Kaner said. Silicone is widely used in industry, in products such as lubricants, electrical wire insulation and biomedical implants, and it now has the potential for energy harvesting.\nCo-authors include Abdelsalam Ahmed, who conducted the research while completing his doctoral studies at the University of Toronto; Islam Hassan and Ravi Selvaganapathy of Canada’s McMaster University; and James Rusling of the University of Connecticut and his research team.\nKaner’s research was funded by Nanotech Energy, a company spun off from his research (Kaner is chair of its scientific advisory board and El-Kady is chief technology officer); and Kaner’s Dr. Myung Ki Hong Endowed Chair in Materials Innovation.\nKaner’s laboratory has produced numerous devices, including a membrane that separates oil from water and cleans up the debris left by oil fracking. Fracking is a technique to extract gas and oil from shale rock.\nKaner, El-Kady and colleagues designed a device in 2017 that can use solar energy to inexpensively and efficiently create and store energy, which could be used to power electronic devices and to create hydrogen fuel for eco-friendly cars. This year, they published research on their design of the first fire-retardant, self-extinguishing motion sensor and power generator, which could be embedded in shoes or clothing worn by firefighters and others who work in harsh environments.\nKaner is among the world’s most influential and highly cited scientific researchers. He was selected as the recipient of the American Institute of Chemists 2019 Chemical Pioneer Award, which honors chemists and chemical engineers who have made outstanding contributions that advance the science of chemistry or greatly impact the chemical profession.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T16:53:17Z","url":"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/best-in-snow-new-scientific-device-creates-electricity-from-snowfall"}

The co-author of the 2009 book Trust Agents is so intent on sharing his work that he wants readers to access it as soon as they unwrap their new holiday Kindles.\nThe Flinch will be available for free via Amazon until the end of June 2012. A print version will follow - for a price - but Smith, 32, said he's more focused on getting his words out than on making a buck or two. He hopes this short work will help readers overcome their primitive instinct to flinch when a risky opportunity presents itself.\nIn an interview with International Business Times, Smith discussed his new book, overcoming inhibitions, and the prospect of (eventually) turning a profit after giving his intellectual property away for free.\nYour marketing strategy for this book is...unusual. Do you have a background in business?\nActually, I work in online media. I've worked and written some of the earliest work on social media and building platforms, like blogs. I've been in the social media space since it existed. Before that, I did online radio. I've been involved with Web communities since my teens, and I've managed online communities since I was 15 or so. Now I'm a professional writer and public speaker and a consultant, specifically as it relates to how people are interacting with new online technologies.\nHow would you describe The Flinch?\nThe Flinch is a physical manifestation of a series of psychological walls that we have put around the behavior that we are allowed or not allowed to do. It comes from the fact that as humans, our job is to continue to survive and avoid predators, and not really to push boundaries at all. Now we're in an environment very different from the one we've evolved to work in. In some ways, the flinch is still useful. However, in most circumstances, the flinch is hindering you from the way you need to behave to succeed at what you do.\nIs The Flinch an evolutionary relic we need to discard completely?\nIt's not possible to entirely get rid of it. We just need to transform this reaction into something that rewards us when we have a barrier to cross.\nAnd you provide readers a series of homework assignments to help in this process.\nThe homework assignments are extremely simple. One is, I tell people to immediately volunteer for something before they resist. The purpose is to simply break your programming. In many cases, it's very valuable. We flinch at being able to talk to a person we might like. We end up limiting our opportunities because we are unable to talk to strangers. We need to break this tendency in order to get the best possible scenario.\nYou published your book electronically. And for free.\nThe idea is that there are so many Kindles being wrapped right now for Christmas. You want to be in front of as many people as possible. To me, that's priceless. This is a very small sacrifice to make in order to spread an idea that matters. Most people aren't taking advantage of it. If you're writing a book with profit as the motive, that's not going to work.\nAnd you didn't want to flinch.\nIt seemed like a very quick window of opportunity. To me it's an expression of an idea in its purest form. There is no price you can pay for that. In some ways it benefits my career. But on a larger scale, it's something that genuinely allows me to feel like I've contributed. For someone who is normally a business writer, that is very valuable.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T12:59:57Z","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/author-q-julien-smith-wants-you-get-over-flinch-387404"}

{"text":"ADRIEN RABIOT will not feature for Paris Saint-Germain in Tuesday's Champions League clash against Manchester United despite an injury crisis crippling the French champions.\nThe midfielder remains frozen out of the squad after he refused to sign a contract extension with the Parisians.\nRabiot has not played since December 11 and, according to L'Equipe, that will not change on Tuesday night when PSG face Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United at Old Trafford.\nThe 23-year-old midfielder hoped his stand-off with the club would end after he was included in the French champs' squad for the Champions League knockout stages.\nBut PSG chief Thomas Tuchel left Rabiot in Paris - despite his side being decimated by injuries with Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Thomas Mounier all sidelined for Tuesday's tie.\nRabiot is planning to leave Parc des Princes on a free transfer in the summer as several Premier League sides are competing for his signature with Barcelona.\nBut the midfielder's decision to see his contract out backlashed as Rabiot has been isolated from the squad despite being fully fit.\nThe Frenchman is reportedly banned even from his team's dressing room having frustrated PSG's top brass - although he was pictured training alongside his team-mates ahead of their trip to Manchester.\nMeanwhile, Solskjaer is brimming with optimism ahead of the Champions League clash.\nHe told reporters at a press conference ahead of Tuesday's match: \"Going into this game I do not think we could be in a better frame of mind with the confidence and form we have.\n\"We have a playing style and we all agree on how we should approach games.

{"text":"So you're renting a car? It's no big deal, unless something goes wrong. Here's a checklist based on our own experiences and on the rental cars we've seen in our shop lately.\nHave all your IDs with you. This includes drivers license and the credit card you used to make the reservation. Check cards are dead on arrival. You say you're well-to-do and don't carry a major credit card with you? BIG MISTAKE. You will not be rented a vehicle if you do not have one. Too bad if you are a millionaire, ALL of the rental companies are very strict on this.\nRead your automobile insurance policy before you rent, paying special attention to any sections pertaining to rental vehicles. Bring your insurance card in case you're asked to prove you have insurance.\nRead your credit card documentation. Most cards provide some kind of insurance on rental cars when charged to their card. Check limits and exclusions. If in doubt pay for the additional insurance. I know of one driver who owes $10,000 for a wrecked rental auto when on vacation in Alaska, with no valid insurance coverage.\nMake sure you're old enough. Just married at age 21 ... on your honeymoon? Sorry, most companies will not rent to drivers under age 25 without prior approval from the mother ship or verifying your driving record history. Visit DMV for a copy. Ask questions in advance so you're not stranded at the airport.\nRead the fine print about tracking devices (location and speeding), out of state driving fees, mileage limits, fuel return policy. Paying for a full tank in advance saves time and aggravation so you can return it empty. Also if the tank is half full when you first get the vehicle make a note of it. Ask now or pay later.\nBefore you put those keys in the door make sure they work the trunk -- and gas cap, if it has one.\nEyeball the tires for low pressure and tread wear. If you're unsure check them with a gauge. Check the sidewall for the psi. If wear bars are showing or tread is missing anywhere on the tire or there are any bulges or what you would consider abnormal indicators do not take the auto.\nMake sure there is a jack and a spare with lug wrench.\nAsk for any phone numbers to call should the car get stuck or break down. Write them down on the back of the rental envelope if they are already not on there.\nIf you have to have any repairs while underway keep all documentation, repair orders, towing bills, etc. and maybe a picture or two. In general, you should call before having any work done. The company may prefer to bring you a replacement car.\nCheck the windshield for bug guts, mud or crud. In fact if the car looks like a demo from a movie set in the Amazon (I have seen a lot of these lately), check under the seats for critters, refuse the vehicle and ask to speak with the manager. Nothing worse than a filthy or bad-smelling driving experience.\nCheck the brakes. Remember, you're not used to this car. You should know how hard you have to press on the pedal to gauge your stopping distance. If the pedal is soft, goes to the floor, creeps under steady pressure, or if the brakes make grinding noises upon application, get another vehicle.\nAdjust all your mirrors. If any mirrors are missing do not take the auto.\nDo one last walkaround to note any damage before you take the vehicle. Drive back to the ticket window and make sure they make a note of any problems, dents, cracked lenses, missing hubcaps etc. Turn on your headlamps and indicator lamps. Note now or get charged later.\nDrive with care. It's not your car! You don't want to spend your vacation or travel time picking up the pieces from I-95.\nAutoman operates an independent auto repair shop in North Carolina.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T11:57:01Z","url":"https://www.consumeraffairs.com/travel/auto_rental_tips.html"}

{"text":"Nicole Kidman wears the Duet Pinky Ring while accepting her Emmy award last night.\nLast night's Emmy Awards were a triumph for diversity and inclusiveness. Awards went to the likes of Riz Ahmed, who won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series, making him the first South Asian man in Emmy's 69-year history to win for acting. Or Lena Waithe, who is the first African American woman to win for comedic writing.\nThere was one message, though, that was quietly making a statement without saying a word.\nTwo Hollywood stars who were also winners last night, Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley, were both spotted wearing Duet Pink Rings by the company dedicated to creating a \"supportive, powerful network for the women in its tribe,\" Shiffon Co.\nA close-up of the Duet Pinky Ring on Actress, Shailene Woodley, at the 69th Annual Emmy Awards.\nThe adjustable pinky ring that coils around the finger and ends with two stones (a sapphire and diamond, or diamond and diamond) represents a pinky promise, referencing the unbreakable pact you made when you were kids. The idea behind the Duet Pinky Ring is that it serves as a physical reminder to promise to pay it forward to other women. The side-by-side stones were even designed to represent one woman supporting one another.\n\"We wanted to build an innovative and empowered brand for women since so many of the top household names were founded by men,\" says the jewelry company's founder, Shilpa Yarlagadda.\nShiffon Co., a collective of eight women who are still undergrads at top universities like Harvard and Stanford, are donating 50% of the sales of the rings to seed grants for start-ups around the world whose mission it is to support, uplift, educate or promote the well-being, safety, health and general advancement of women and girls.\nThese driven group of students were able to get the rings onto the hands of these A-listers simply through the potency of the company mission--they did not use PR or pay the actors to wear them. Instead, the women behind Shiffon Co. got through to Kidman and Woodley and pitched the ring. The two actors then decided the cause was one they wanted to support and wore the pinky ring to the Emmys in solidarity with the company mission. Before them, Emma Watson donned the ring and gave it a shout out on her Instagram account dedicated to her fashion, the_press_tour.\nLike Kidman and Watson, Hitha Herzog, Chief Research Officer of H Squared Research, was one of those people on the other end of a cold call from the team at Shiffon Co. Herzog, too, was so moved by their mission, she joined their Board of Directors. \"Shilpa's email to me was short but thought-provoking, she didn't add extra words or bury the lede,\" Herzog says. \"Then I met with her and was blown away. When asked, Shilpa answered all of my questions in a way that displayed she had a good grasp on how retail works. Most importantly, she was a genuinely kind person.\"\nSimilarly, celebrity stylist, Sarah Slutsky, also received a call from the founders, which led to her becoming one of the company's closest mentors. \"I get a lot emails from people who are looking to start a business or get into fashion, but something about their energy right off the bat felt really different. There was a need to give back and to do something bigger than them,\" says Slutsky. \"And as a stylist, jewelry is very important to me and what I do. It's very personal and representative, so it's nice to be able to present something to clients that has such meaning.\"\nWith the company motto, \"wear the change you want to see,\" these young founders aspire to bring the best in humanity by working to create a world where young girls grow up knowing they can follow their passions with the support of a worldwide network of strong women.\n\"We want people to stand up for what they believe in by supporting other women,\" adds Yarlagadda. \"It's crazy, but I think we can create a more connected and supported world for women through making beautiful jewelry.\"","timestamp":"2019-04-18T21:24:05Z","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccasuhrawardi/2017/09/18/hollywood-a-listers-are-part-of-a-quiet-movement-and-its-supporters-are-wearing-this-ring/"}

{"text":"The PPP model has been made mandatory in metro rail projects, but it has not been successful in at least three cities – Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad.\nThe cabinet chaired by prime minister Narendra Modi approved a new Metro Rail Policy that makes PPP component mandatory for availing central assistance of new metro projects. Private investment and other innovative forms of financing of metro projects have been made compulsory to meet the huge resource demand for capital intensive high capacity metro projects.\n“Private participation either for complete provision of metro rail or for some unbundled components (like Automatic Fare Collection, Operation & Maintenance of services etc) will form an essential requirement for all metro rail projects seeking central financial assistance,” says the policy, to capitalize on private resources, expertise and entrepreneurship.\n“Nobody will come forward for construction of Metro rail as it has never been a profitable investment. Private players will look at least 12-15% return while no Metro project has ever yielded an investment return of over 2-3%. It’s the most disastrous and retrograde urban transport policy,” Sreedharan told the Indian Express.\nThe PPP model has run into rough weather in Delhi, Mumbai as well as Hyderabad.\nIn 2012, Delhi Metro's Airport Express project developer, Reliance Infrastructure, sent a notice to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and sought termination of the project.\nThe Reliance Infra-led consortium has been using the safety excuse to abandon the project. The cost of the Airport Express line was Rs 18,000 crore, but it suffered a loss of Rs 300 crore in the first year of operation, reported India Today.\nFive years later, Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure, won an arbitration against DMRC, which would fetch the company a compensation of Rs 2,950 crore for the termination of the concession agreements for the project, the Anil Ambani-led company said in a statement, reported Economic Times.\nThe story was similar in Mumbai where Reliance Infrastructure-owned Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), operates the 11.4 km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar metro line, said in June 2016 that it was incurring huge losses.\nReliance runs MMOPL in a public–private partnership with Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).\n“MMOPL is incurring annual loss over Rs 300 crore and cash loss of about Rs 175 crore per annum. This loss is preliminary on account of increase in project cost due to delay in receipt of unencumbered Right of Way (RoW) / Land by Government & Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). Further, 100 percent unencumbered RoW / Land was to be given to us by September 2007 as per the Concession Agreement, but was finally handed over to us in February 2014, a month before we applied for CMRS (commissioner of metro railway safety) certification,'' MMOPL spokesperson told Business Standard.\nReliance Infrastructure also told the Bombay High Court in August 2016 that it was incurring daily losses of Rs 1 crore to keep the services running. “For the project, we put in Rs 4,000 crore, of which a large chunk was borrowed. We now have to start repaying that. Initially, the MMRDA had promised that they would put in Rs 1,500 crore, but in the end, only contributed Rs 600 crore,” senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas told Justice VM Kanade and Justice MS Sonak, reported Mid Day.\nHyderabad too saw the PPP model running into trouble.\nIn September 2014, Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), the company building the Rs.16,375 crore Hyderabad Metro rail project, threatened to pull out because of issues relating to project viability and non-availability of right of way.\nL&T proposed that the Telangana government take over the project.\n“GoT should do so by restituting the concessionaire in a manner whereby the concessionaire’s property and entitlements are returned to it,” V.B. Gadgil, chief executive and managing director of L&T Hyderabad Metro Rail Pvt. Ltd, wrote in a letter, reported The Mint.\nThe new metro rail policy announced on Wednesday stresses that it opens a big window for private investments.\nPrivate investment and other innovative forms of financing of metro projects have been made compulsory to meet the huge resource demand for capital intensive high capacity metro projects.\nSeeking to ensure that least cost mass transit mode is selected for public transport, the new policy mandates Alternate Analysis, requiring evaluation of other modes of mass transit like BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System), Light Rail Transit, Tramways, Metro Rail and Regional Rail in terms of demand, capacity, cost and ease of implementation.\nThe new policy mandates Transit Oriented Development (TOD) to promote compact and dense urban development along metro corridors since TOD reduces travel distances besides enabling efficient land use in urban areas. Under the policy, States need to adopt innovative mechanisms like Value Capture Financing tools to mobilize resources for financing metro projects by capturing a share of increase in the asset values through ‘Betterment Levy’. States would also be required to enable low cost debt capital through issuance of corporate bonds for metro projects.\nAt present, metro projects with a total length of 370 km are operational in 8 cities -- Delhi (217 km), Bengaluru (42.30 km), Kolkata (27.39 km), Chennai (27.36 km), Kochi (13.30 km), Mumbai (Metro Line 1-11.40 km, Mono Rail Phase 1-9.0 km), Jaipur-9 km and Gurugram (Rapid Metro-1.60 km).\nMetro Projects with a total length of 537 kms are in progress in 13 cities. New cities acquiring metro services are; Hyderabad (71 km), Nagpur (38 km), Ahmedabad (36 km), Pune (31.25 km) and Lucknow (23 km).\nMetro projects with a total length of 595 km in 13 cities including 10 new cities are at various stages of planning and appraisal. These are; Delhi Metro Phase IV- 103.93 km, Delhi & NCR-21.10 km, Vijayawada-26.03 km, Visakhapatnam-42.55 km, Bhopal-27.87 km, Indore-31.55 km, Kochi Metro Phase II-11.20 km, Greater Chandigarh Region Metro Project-37.56 km, Patna-27.88 km, Guwahati-61 km, Varanasi-29.24 km, Thiruvananthapuram & Kozhikode (Light Rail Transport)-35.12 km and Chennai Phase II-107.50 km.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T13:19:46Z","url":"https://www.governancenow.com/news/regular-story/-ppp-model-in-metro-rail-may-not-be-a-good-idea"}
{"text":"I’ve always had an interest in colour. Coming from Scotland, where the weather often turns everything grey, I used to love how the landscape would transform when the sun came out. I had a view of the Ochil hills from my bedroom window which became an ever-changing kaleidoscope of colours through the seasons.\nIt was this blend of colours in nature that gave me my first introduction into colour harmony. In the world around us colours juxtapose with one another all the time, but the very fact that they do means it’s often easy to take the striking harmonies they produce for granted. Think about an inky grey sky against a wet green hill, or a bright orange beak against a blackbird’s feathers. Even the bright red poppy, which brightens yellow and green fields around the country, is made redder and more distinctive by the green stem and leaves which support it. Of course, there’s no real need to understand how colour works (unless, like me, you have to!). But just as learning the musical structure of a favourite song or finding out the backstory of a favourite novel enhances our appreciation for those works, so too can understanding colour harmonies enhance how we see.\nColour therefore plays a crucial role in our lives. It can remind us of a place, a smell, a time of year, a person; our memories and cultures are filled with colour associations. They can even have different meanings from one culture to another. For example, in Japanese culture, yellow represents bravery and wealth, whilst in France the same colour represents jealousy and betrayal. In many cultures, blue represents masculinity, whereas it is considered a feminine colour in China. And red – the colour of danger, passion, love and fear in countless western cultures – is actually symbolic of mourning in South Africa.\nAbove all, colour is something that we can have an instinctive and long-lasting personal reaction to. We either like or don’t like certain colours and we don’t need words to explain why, because our emotive response to colours were there well before language developed – before we gave them names. My favourite colour is blue – which may well be most people’s favourite colour – and I can’t imagine it ever becoming boring for me. There are so many beautiful blues in art. I love Matisse’s blue cut-out nudes, for which he used gouache straight from the tube, painted it onto sheets of paper and then “cut” directly into colour. The French artist Yves Klein fell so in love with blue that not only did he make it the star of both his paintings and performances, he also patented his own shade: Yves Klein Blue.\nThis book is a celebration of colour. I hope people will find inspiration in the illustrations and learn a few things they didn’t know. Most importantly, I hope it encourages people to have a bolder relationship with the colours in the world around them.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T20:37:14Z","url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/colouring-our-view-of-the-world-1.3225104"}

{"text":"When Rick Gates turned against his former boss, he described a parallel ethical universe where lying and cheating were as comfortable as a well-tailored ostrich suit.\nYou know what would be surprising? If Rick Gates and Paul Manafort had suddenly suspended their apparently deeply ingrained habits of fraudulence and thievery during the three months they ran the Donald Trump campaign.\nOther chapters of their recent history—the chapters bracketing the campaign—include alleged episodes of witness tampering, lying to federal prosecutors, bank and tax fraud, as well as the failure to register as agents of a foreign government. Therefore, given all that has emerged about their shared ethical framework, it’s hard to imagine that the public has received the exhaustive account of those months.\nTo understand just how ingrained their slippery habits had become, consider a defining moment from Monday’s proceedings of the Manafort trial. In the course of turning state’s witness against his old boss, Gates, a former lobbyist, admitted to the court that he had repeatedly defrauded Manafort by inflating the expense reports he submitted to him. It wasn’t a trivial sum that he had siphoned. He described his take as amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Or put it this way: Gates defrauded Manafort, who was, in turn, allegedly defrauding banks and the United States government (with his Potemkin tax returns).\nNor was there anything necessarily spiteful about Gates filching a little cash on the sly. Based on everything I’ve ever heard or read in the course of my reporting on Manafort, Gates worshipped his boss. He felt a sense of subservience, love even. And the warmth was mutual, and could be described as filial. But that bond was never going to get in the way of bilking Manafort. They had spent nearly a decade in Ukraine, working for oligarchs and politicians. During those years abroad, the pair adopted the business practices of the Ukrainian political elite.\nThe president would then ask his chief of staff to collect contributions from the financial patrons of his political party. One Manafort associate told me that in the course of passing the hat to oligarchs, the chief of staff would collect more money than the bill required. The chief of staff would pocket some of that surplus cash for himself, a small tax for his efforts. In Ukraine, the rich excel at finding novel ways to exact fees, to skim money, to capture rents. Having participated in the system for so long, it seems Manafort and Gates internalized these techniques themselves.\nSo what? One strand of conventional wisdom holds that the Manafort trial has little to do with Trump, let alone Russian collusion. Indeed, there’s a strong argument to be made that this case stands on its own as a significant moment in political history. But we’re still staring at a highly incomplete version of the full narrative—and it’s too soon to foreclose the possibility that this trial is merely prologue, filled with foreshadowing and suggestive hints of how everything might ultimately tie together.\nLast week, I argued that Manafort needs to be understood as a symptom of a global epidemic of kleptocracy—a virus that he imported into the United States. We know that his tenure in the Trump campaign contains at least some evidence that he infected the campaign, too. According to Robert Mueller’s prosecutors, Manafort promised a job on the campaign to a Chicago banker in exchange for $16 million in loans. The banker ended up as one of the Trump campaign’s 13 official economic advisors. Could it be possible that that’s the only instance of Manafort and Gates applying their Ukrainian education to the Trump campaign?\nWith Gates’s testimony, Mueller has orchestrated an important demonstration project. He’s shown how he can turn protégé against mentor, how he can weaponize a devoted underling to destroy his beloved boss. How once he can get a campaign insider talking, what flows is damning beyond expectations. The question is now whether Gates’s testimony represents the culmination of a long and corrupt story, or the opening pages of a much more complicated tale.","timestamp":"2019-04-23T16:44:41Z","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/paul-manafort-trial-betrayal/566945/"}
{"text":"At one point during an episode of the CW's mystery series Cult, one of the characters makes another the impassioned promise that \"There will be an answer!\" Given the show's intense love affair with metafiction, I wondered if the line might be a winking acknowledgement that it's only the latest in a long line of post-Lost series that revolves around a slowly unfolding puzzle, a subgenre that from its progenitor on has been long on teases and short on actual answers. I also thought to myself, they better give us that answer in season one because there's no way this thing's going to get picked up again. The end seems to have come sooner than I expected. Yesterday, the CW announced that its slot for the next three Fridays will be filled by reruns of The Carrie Diaries.\nCult's incredibly convoluted central conceit is that in the fictional Cult universe there is a show called Cult about a police officer on a mission to take down Billy Grimm, the charismatic leader of the highly unorthodox religious sect that she was raised in, and that it's spawned a massive, intensely obsessive fan base with a radical wing that essentially worships Grimm as if he were a real-life spiritual leader and has begun to dabble in ritualized murder. Jeff, a journalist, has a mentally ill brother, Nate, who becomes consumed with solving the meta-show's puzzles and disappears under highly suspicious circumstances, leaving behind a crazy-looking trove of research indicating that the Cult cult's responsible. Skye is a production assistant on the meta-show who discovers the so-called True Believers by monitoring the online communities that have sprung up around the show and begins to suspect that its secretive, eccentric executive producer, Stephen Rae (who in a clever extra-meta twist is credited as executive producer of the real Cult), is actively encouraging and guiding them.\nCult had a lot going against it, starting with the fact that explaining the basic plot of the show to someone at a bar takes several minutes and a lot of air-quotes and diagrams, and even then is so complicated that by the time you're done the person you're explaining it to will most likely be totally uninterested in expending the brain power to actually watch it. And being a show on the CW, the cast basically looks like the cast of a CW show, just a little too pretty to be read as actual people, with the exception of Prison Break's Robert Knepper, who plays Grimm, and the continually great Aisha Hinds as the shady detective working to keep Jeff and Skye from discovering the nature of the True Believers.\nLost, ridiculously long and complex theories on What It All Means. It's the nature of modern fandom that we don't just passively consume entertainment anymore; we actively engage with it through remixes. Obsession has become the mainstream. The water-cooler chat about last night's episode has been supplanted by online communities of devotees who don't think it's at all weird that your life revolves around an entertainment property. And when there are people who get so deeply into TV shows and movies that they will, for instance, self-identify as giant alien cat-people, the idea of a group of diehard fans following the instructions of a fictional cult leader isn't so hard to believe.\nThe real-world Cult doesn't seem to have done much to inspire that kind of devotion. Its apparent cancelation hasn't caused much noise online, and a grassroots campaign to save it (another common feature of modern fandom) doesn't seem very likely. But it had some good ideas, and once you understand the metafictional setup, its central mystery is compelling enough to easily inspire some binge viewing on Hulu. As the geek-culture blog io9 suggests, there could still be a DVD set in the future, or a spot for it in the CW's summer lineup, where we could see how the rest of the season plays out. Which hopefully there will be, because as cheesy as the show could be, it managed to get its hooks in me. And I still want that answer.\nMiles Raymer is a writer based in New York City who has contributed to the Chicago Reader, Vice, Pitchfork, and others.","timestamp":"2019-04-18T21:00:18Z","url":"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a18134/cult-cw-canceled/"}
{"text":"French president Emmanuel Macron is expected this week to announce his conclusions after three months of nationwide debate aimed at placating violent protests against his reformist agenda.\nAs Mr Macron prepares to announce his five-point plan, protesters have taken to the streets for the 22nd consecutive weekend of mobilisation.\nA rally called for by the gilet jaunes in Toulouse, the capital of France’s southern Occitan region, drew over 31,000 protesters – up from last week’s 22,300 participants.\nEight hundred policemen were deployed to the area to contain the protesters, who built barricades and attempted to push through to the city centre. Police forces responded with teargas, stun grenades and water cannons to disperse the crowd.\nThe government’s refusal to authorise protests in Paris did not prevent the gilets jaunes from pouring into the Champs-Elysées, the upper-class shopping quarter that has been the theatre of violent clashes.\nAccording to the interior ministry, at least 5,000 people took to the streets of Paris despite the lack of authorisation.\nDemonstrations in the Champs-Elysées have damaged shops and businesses in the area. Around 72,600 people in 5,000 companies are estimated to have been forced to work reduced work hours for reduced pay since the yellow vest protest movement started on November 17.\nRights groups including Amnesty International, however, are opposed to the law as it encroaches on freedom of speech and the right to protest. Amnesty International, Attac, UNEF, SOS Racisme and others staged a protest on Saturday to express their dissent.\nAgainst this backdrop, Mr Macron is set to announce his plan to reconcile the nation. According to an internal source quoted by French newspaper Le Monde, the president may present his five-point plan as soon as Sunday or Monday evening.\nThe president’s proposal around the issue of taxation – which was the spark that ignited the protests five months ago – will be the most scrutinised.\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe said taxes – and how to “lower them faster” – will be at the heart of the president’s announcement.","timestamp":"2019-04-20T02:20:59Z","url":"https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-to-announce-outcome-of-nationwide-debate-1.848828"}
{"text":"Is This the 'Next Generation Firework Show'?\nI don't know. It might work. Look at electric cars. People thought they'd be boring and now the technology has advanced to being one of the best means of transportation around. Of course this will never fly for people who like sudden loud noises.\nFor all you folks WHINING about replacing \"real fireworks\" with alternatives (drones and laser light shows), I suggest you move to any of the areas in drought then rethink that position. In Colorado, we are in a drought over much of the state - and HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES ARE BURNING FROM WILDFIRES. About 40 \"real fireworks\" shows were cancelled or replaced (out of about 120 statewide), there were a couple of drone shows and couple of laser light shows as well as \"real fireworks\". Guess which kind caused BRUSH FIRES (and the worst was a result of one of the \"professional shows\" while some smaller fires were the result of ID10TS who didn't take weather and dryness conditions into consideration). Frankly, I hope that dolts like you lose EVERYTHING EXCEPT YOUR LIVES to a fire caused by fireworks (or have a loved one go through that) since you are more than willing to have others face that.","timestamp":"2019-04-22T21:03:54Z","url":"https://www.newser.com/story/261509/is-this-the-next-generation-firework-show.html"}
